Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white dress
He's charismatic.
The Masses of the Holy Mass to be released and healed by him bring the crowds.
He was only a few years old when things went unexplainable in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
For the Holy Mass to liberate and heal, the crowds gather.
Once upon a time, the parents of a seven-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart came to him.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprising doctors said: “The operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s spiritual extraordinary activities began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, the souls of the pure came to him with a request for help.
I was awakened at night and inclined to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment – he remembers.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body has begun to change.
I lost my human qualities and started to take the look of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get a voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“I was immersed in the waters of a river symbolizing the baptism of the saint, and was released and returned to human form,” he says.
He didn't tell anyone about those strange experiences.
It was a mature calling.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In his sermons, he wanted more than just to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismic Community of the Redemption in the Holy Spirit
Father Witko's Masses of Healing are attended by many who count on getting rid of the disease.
However, the spiritual one points out that spiritual healing is their primary objective, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th), the afternoon team of Kolpinga FRAC earned the current Polish Master Dartom Dartom of Bogoria Gródisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Super League of Tennis Table.
The Jaroslavians in such a personal score as they presented to the citizens have no chance of winning the league's sovereigns.
It was a victory with Darth Bogoria.
The team still lacks Chen Jingqi, the team leader.
Perhaps with him, the celebration would reach third in a row of triumphs in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet come to victory with such apes as Grek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The Hellada contestant was the biggest star of the match in the MoSIR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaroslav.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three singles Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five-hundred-and-a-half-fight – Pavl Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't make it to Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafal Trzaskowski's announcements, a programme of free preventive research for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not obtained the acceptance of the Ministry of Health and its subsidiary Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
In support of that, the Agency explained that the target group had been wrongly selected.
“These actions may even affect the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of the difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and may adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with falsely positive test results”, wrote the report.
The decision of the resort is not understood by the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we have foreseen the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to lead to a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and to take a good approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzakowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that experts say: Let's not study, because there will be longer courses with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state," the PO policy added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly session that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian countries.
"If the future Government of Israel, which will arise, comes to the realization of this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.
"We will reject the entire plan completely and completely," he threatened Abbas with pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – little matter what these consequences will be – by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel’s previous prime minister, again received a government-forming mission after the 17 September elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would include all the Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a number of peace agreements to which the United States served.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the UN General Assembly session to hold the Palestinian popular elections on the ground.
The latter took place in 2006.
"After my return to the country, I will call on the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the President of Palestine solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, which was treated as a permanent observer at the UN, the use of the powers of "full members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas's speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “will prefer to focus on the efforts of Palestinian Authority against Israel in the United Nations rather than to fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomous Republic under his leadership”.
According to the agencies, however, Danon did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the Palestinian land.
Paramedics want defibrillators in New York's Industrial Points.
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The Provincial Emergency Station in Industry wants such devices to be located in the city's neural points.
For their position, the officers received diplomas of congratulations from the Provincial Emergency Station in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicator Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojcik are officers of the Sub-Karpacki Customs Office in Industry.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, an activist's wife, the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village called on September 23rd to announce that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death - he didn't reveal.
At Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a “accidental accident. ”
105 million PLN for video games companies from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will reach companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, for example, was the development of a platform to create field games based on the AR game engine, creating a real world map along with an application to enable users to transmit data; a test-and-training platform to verify practical skills in the position of work and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game to simulate the management of real production processes using a innovative game model based on virtual world interaction with the real world using industry 4.0 – the communication of the NCBR sent on Friday.
The objective of the GameINN Sector Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market in the future by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"The Specially Prepared GameINN Research Agenda, which is already 300 million PLN of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme, is an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," we read in the Communication.
The video gaming industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
"The incentives put in place by the government for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R & D facilities, competence improvement programmes, IP boxes or support programmes implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to the innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R & D in 2018 than they did a year ago.
"The amount of the deducted costs for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN," stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.
The director of the NCBR, Wojciech Kamieenecki, recalls that in the previous two funding competitions of a total of more than PLN 211.2 million, 78 were awarded to innovative projects.
A huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of proposals made show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly encouraging that projects selected, as in previous editions, include projects on solutions for not only entertainment but also industry-related 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, up to PLN 20 million could be applied for by entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total of PLN 317 million.
The competition budget at the time of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, making it possible for 27 projects to receive almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN III is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Smart Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of the Polish Games Associated Entrepreneurs, which includes companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
It was September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajaksu Amsterdam to Nice in late August, found out after training that his watch had disappeared from the wardrobe.
Not at all, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
The footballers in the locker room have a private safe, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, he eventually confessed to stealing Diaby-Fadig.
The 18-year-old already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danes to pay the money back for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.
He made it to Nice as a 13-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He was in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – according to the newspaper “L'Equipe” – the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
So far, he's initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses comments on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of the germs, you have to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
But most of us wash them more quickly!
Just warm water and regular soap – it is not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them).
By washing, we wipe not only the bottoms and the tops of the hand, but also: fingertips (jointed or single) – rub them with colossal movements with the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (put your hands together, wipe your fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb is covered with the other hand and in such a volume we turn it to the right and left for a moment.
In an emergency situation (when hands cannot be washed), we should wipe our hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in drugs, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or door with your hands washed (the recommendation of the General Inspectorate of Sanitation).
Open it with a paper towel.
President of Iran says he rejected the proposal to speak with the United States, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not speak to the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US's offer to lift sanctions," Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, commented that the Iranian side had asked for an end to the restrictions that he had not agreed to.
According to President Hassan Rowhani of Iran, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had been inspired by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not take up talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks from the US, and to the European parties to the nuclear agreement, he rejected US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a precondition which does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can overcome this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian side.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said "no!" was tweeted by the President of the United States.
Voltage with nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
In exchange for lifting Iran's economic sanctions, the nuclear weapons programme will be abandoned and the nuclear sector will be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is using the strategy of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iran's oil.
Tehran announced that if it did not receive a permit to export raw material, it would limit its obligations every 60 days as a result of the agreement.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screenplays from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking against the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the NSA.
Reason: No disciplinary action has been initiated against him, so there is no basis for maintaining the management of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman with the NSA, opened an investigation against the Smithsman at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into an action against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take up the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, a judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, because of suspicion of participation in the Heitera group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the Heiter group.
He claims there's no evidence of that except for the fake screen and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
The same is true of other judges associated with “Casta: all are innocent, there is no evidence. ”
And it's quite possible they'll bet on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't shake her finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, she's also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she kept in June on another case.
The police did not shake their fingers to secure the devices of the persons whom Judge Waldemar Zürek referred to as persecutors in February.
There is no evidence – there is no case of Szmydt, there is no case of "Casty".
There is also no case of the chief of NI Marian Banas for renting a stone house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA's checking his property statements.
And he'll check it out when he checks it out.
The Commission will not deal with the Banasi Ethical Ethics because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has gathered somehow to make a curiosal decision to dismiss the Banasians and appoint their lawyers, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide for).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about my wife coming home and having a husband with a lover in bed.
She's so surprised and devastated that she can't cross the word.
She's standing at the door mute, and in the meantime, the lover jumps out of bed quickly, dresses and leaves.
And the husband's a bed-bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What woman, honey?
Only that "Casty" or "Banasia" is about the state's parody.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Litzvinko in the final jump up
Early in this season to compete after the break of the mother's contestant, the brown medalist of the world championship from London 2017, first tried to beat 1.85 and 1.89 and second in 1.92.
1.94 only managed to get it in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first test was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically," Litswinko admitted to the Eurosport camera.
The best were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik, after 1.94.
Both of the contestants were the only ones who didn't lose any height.
The jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Cornell Morawiecki is in a hospital in severe condition
He got to the hospital, and the doctors call his condition tough.
It must be added that he is conscious and conscious.
"We believe that this will result in another victory.
We all pray to get him back to health," Cornell Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, said in a conversation with the "Super Express" journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My closest family and politics keep me alive," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to the "Super Express" journalists two weeks ago.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been tested at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan found I had a pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki performed a serious operation at the MSWA hospital in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Zbigniew Crassus, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
"I know that many people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to be in chemo yet.
I put myself in the hands of doctors of experts who are rather good at thinking.
For now, after this difficult operation, I must return to some state of use.
I hope that everything will be okay," Cornell Morawiecki pointed out in January in a conversation with "SE".
"If I were to give in too late to the study, the situation would be tragic and I would say good-bye to this fall," he added.
Cracow: A 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nell Stokłosa.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to be contacted.
She left her place of residence on September 26th and has not returned or made contact with her loved ones.
She was last seen at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, 6'6", has blond hair and blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police number 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the lead jumps.
The title of the relations with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hypodrome on Oleandra Street in Olav, may be misleading for some.
The way to true power is far away, but that's the name that defines one of the types of horse competition...
The contest of the power of the jumps consists of overcoming by riders and horses ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbroken world record, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, is 247 cm.
So high in Olav, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is not one of the worst...
The competitions organized by the untiring Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle ” were a demonstration of some of the previously played “Friendly Riding Professionals ” that we write more widely about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons trained to ride in the JKS in Olavska joined the competition.
Four competed on the horses and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra, sitting in a crazy "Sprinter" was the best.
This small but dynamic rum started with overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm and ended only at a station with a top beam of 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three subsequent refusals was he dismissed by the jury of the competition from further competition.
Amelia Pawlak, who sits in "Famy" and the third Lena Borunj on "Harmider" took second place in the pony jumpings.
Inga Aksman, the youngest participant in the tournament, fought ambitiously and leaping through obstacles on the small "Carmen" marsh.
Even more emotions were accompanied by running Amazons and viewers during the big horses competition.
Paulina Shewczyk, who was sitting on the Declaration and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Fleece".
Fortunately, no harm has been done to the Amazons or the horses, so they continued to participate in the contest.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" mare on the parkurine were faced by Veronika Łukkiewicz.
She needed either a trainer's assistant, or another steam horse that had a bit of a crazy Winnett.
After counting the obstacles from the park, she also went down with full strength, so the moments in the boxing and the resuscitation were dangerous. "Everything is under control!" Jan Sienkiewicz reassured some of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the start of the big horses competition, Marta Masalska, who has been sitting in a beautiful presentation of "Whisky", has performed well in the park.
This worthy mare, in conjunction with an experienced Amazon, took the second approach in the final phase to jump 135 cm first and that was the best result of the competition at that time.
At the moment, however, Paulina Szewczyk also included the same height on the “Declaration”, Veronika Łukkiewicz on “Winte” and Anastasia Abramenko on “The Lotka”.
To decorate the fleet and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these players left together, and finally together with the Amazons on the ponies in the course of the Radecki march, they carried out an effective honorary round, ending these interesting and emotional professions.
Thank you.
The Jezdecki Sports Club “In Siodle” warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump power contest during the 16th “Trustful Jezdzieczne”: the City Office in Oława, the Water and Canalization Plant in Oława, the Provincial Age and the company “Mustang”.
Max Colonko cuts himself off from KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Colonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Maxa Colonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Marius Max Colonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters about right-wing views.
Before the election, Colonko announced cooperation with Mark Jacobiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had occurred, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko alone failed to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Colonko has announced on Twitter that he has completed his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Colonko.
"I'll expect the KWW to delete my name from my name.
I kindly ask that my person not be involved with the person mentioned above," he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4th, on the U.S. Independence Day, U.S. journalist Mariusz Max Colonko informed of the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the people," said Colonko.
The party's programme included issues relating to the judiciary (should be chosen in the general elections), tax changes (comparation of the tax-free amount for all), military reparations (in the form of military assistance for the eastern NATO flank, with particular reference to Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, reducing the number of Members or introducing one-manatt constituencies.
A few days after the new political formation was announced, Mariusz Max Colonko began talks with Mark Jacobiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would combine forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally taken place.
UBS: Gold close to the point of balance
"The euro rate will be maintained in the coming months at the vicinity of the 4.35 PLN ceiling, which will be accompanied by a weak global market environment," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"Expecting a strong pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy are talking about stabilising the gold notations at the current ceiling," the expert said in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
"As long as the gold is properly valued – euro ratings should be maintained in the coming months at the vicinity of the 4.35 PLN ceiling – Polish bonds are not as attractive as he thinks.
Much more profitable profitability than Polish paper is offered by emerging market bonds," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's economy.
"The global slowdown may be further deepened, but there should be no severe recession, and as far as possible the decline in GDP growth is concerned slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
"Investors should disregard global actions that may be damaged by the lack of prospects for a solution to the trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and brexit.
Among the stocks markets, Europe should be relatively weak", according to the latest letter to the investors of the head of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haegle.
"Actions from the euro area countries should behave worse than the US because they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty about global trade and fears of slowing down," the document reads.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hoss in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German ten-year-olds to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the profitability decline.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term papers should no longer be reduced, but only in the short term, due to the mitigation of banks' monetary policy.
Fed has the biggest field for foot reductions, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the next year's horizon.
The long-term balance point for euro ratings is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 per cent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will reduce the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"The maintenance of the dollar in the long term may not be allowed by current and budgetary deficits," says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehra is losing his weapon.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, resulting from a confidential survey of the RFN Defense Department.
The information was provided by the media group EditoriesNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from Parliamentary Secretary of State's office at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been re-tracked.
Among the military equipment that remains missing are six MG3, 11 automatic rifles G3, four automatic rifles G36, six signal guns and two P8.
In addition, 30 barrels are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The vice-president of the Left Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "sustainable".
Moreover, as a result of the investigations conducted, only a fraction of the equipment lost was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that the census did not reveal whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehra Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was charged with preparing assassinations for leading German politicians with far-right and racist motives.
His "black list" of goals, which came under the prosecutor's authority, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party, and Anetta Kahane, defender of human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. has illegally entered possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Weeping kids on the plane.
How can you avoid them?
There's a solution.
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the line allows you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If the combination travels to the second year of age, the “child icon” appears on a specific, reserved seat by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the carrier’s services has the option of choosing a distance from that occupied by the male.
The BBC states that the lines have already reported the inadequacy of this solution.
The “Child icon” will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the aircraft has changed at the last minute.
As could be expected, the idea divided the internet.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by using headphones to reduce noise.
They're kids, we used to be.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of seats for breathing mouths, drooling mouths or drunkards,” wrote G Sundar.
Another of the interns noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children on a 13-hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major counts the losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a vacation to Majorka as a result of bankruptcy announced Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
On Friday, according to a representative of the autonomous government of Balearic Marc Pons, among the 25,000 temporary residents who will not be able to avail themselves of October's vacation in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies directly linked to Thomas Cook, e.g. the company Neckermann.
Ponce explained that 80% of the expected temporary residents who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month are German and Scandinavian nationals.
However, according to Pons, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during November-April, the losses for the local economy will be lower.
He announced that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
It is estimated that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 of them are employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many major hotels, the object owners asked the guests to pay an additional charge for the accommodation.
Among other things, this situation has been experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had stopped operating at least until the end of October due to the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the cooperating companies.
In turn, Friday's Diario de Ibiza magazine indicates that most Ibiza-based hotels that worked with Thomas Cook do not have the intention of closing the facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this balearic island, the British bankruptcy was co-operating with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic autonomous authorities announced that they would call on the Spanish government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
It has been revealed that the most affected on this archipelago of tourists, about 36,000 people, is located in Majorca.
According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is dependent on local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of around EUR 5 million.
FIFA women's ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the helm
The women's representation of Poland takes its 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) rankings published on Friday.
In the same position, Coach Milosz Stupinski's team was classified in the previous July summary.
Bad team games.
What's it gonna be like in October?
The remaining leaders were Americans, who recently defended the title of world champion.
Second place in the ranking was held by Germany and third place by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify for ME.
They were supposed to start with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, due to the poisoning of food opponents, was postponed a year.
In this situation, the Poles will initiate qualifications by meeting with the Spaniards on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, "White Red" will play two social matches – 3 October on the trip with Cyprus and 5 days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the Polish rival group there are representatives of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the group and the three best teams from second places are advancing directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the pools with three last passes to the European Championships.
16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the FIFA September ranking fell from 20 to 22.
‘Rz’: Smog oppressed the government
"The effects of Clean Air are zero, and coal kilns will burn as if nothing ever happened this winter," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolita".
"So far, 82,000 applications for funding totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 000 have been positive.
The accepted proposals amount to more than PLN 915 million," reads "Rz", referring to the data from the Minister of Environment's spokesman.
According to the paper, only part of the costs incurred are recovered from the program.
The results of the announced noise program are considered "modest".
Self-governance, quoted by “Rz”, is seen in the failure of “Clean Air”, among others, in too large a bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by mail, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve action," says the mayor of Lidzbark Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alert note that in the first year less than 1% of the intended target of 3 million rolling boilers was implemented.
According to Rz, although the programme budget is PLN 103 billion per 10 years, i.e. PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Environment and Water Management Fund, 1.4 billion PLN was reserved for this year," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Plum: Now the price negotiations
The US Congress has agreed to the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a total of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The Communication underlines that investment will support national security and US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the hunters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department pointed out that the contract would also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of support for logistics and the programme and training of staff.
Thoughts Lockheed Martin F-35
Thought F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin Group is a single and single-engine fifth-generation multi-tasker.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombings and typically air combat missions.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, a hunter is undetectable for close-range radar.
Recently, the F-35 was purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the ageing F-16s.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, will also consider buying American warplanes.
Barbie versus stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of gender neutral dolls into the market.
This is how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Manufacturer Barbie marketed a series of gender neutral dolls
Next to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced a gender-neutral doll into the market.
The "Creatable World" series toys wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
They also gave up stressing the characteristic sex features – the gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and thin waist, or, in the case of Ken, broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like it when their dolls have forced sexual standards, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made with a view to a specific sex inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will make all children feel free," says Mattel.
Barbie doll, who appeared on the market in 1959 in high-sleeved swimwear and high-sleeved shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy women’s stereotypes”, such as unnatural body proportions.
The concert responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have a dozen Members
Zandberg asked on the ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to the Fair from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the letter is launched by candidates to the SLD Fair, Spring and Left Together, starting with the joint logo "Left"), replied that this depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by the hope that the Left is not only right, but also has the strength," he pointed out.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 members.
"This may mean that the circle or club together will have a dozen Members.
But it depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I will not guess and say how this happens," he said.
Asked whether Left Together will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are arranged to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no variety.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that, as we differed, we were able to agree on a common programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint launch is the leader of the SLD Włodzimír Charzaty, Zandberg replied that his biggest beneficiaries are the centrifuge and left-wing voters.
In view of the fact that the SLD will receive the full subsidy, he said that "the goal of the political party is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Fair.
In the case of the election to the Senate, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were to find myself in the Senate district 44, I would take the election certificate and vote in another district," he stressed.
"I should not have tried to vote on Minister Kazimierz Ujadowski (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this district outside Ujadowski, the leader of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS will start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims came by bus, by car and by foot to the Bopp district, where there was a new mosque that could accommodate 30,000 faithful people.
The facility was built by the Mouride brotherhood, which is part of the Sufiic sense of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares passed by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Paradise Path") is derived from the title of the line of Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, 19th century founder of a brotherhood venerated by worshipers as saints.
The mosque is covered with karrarian marble and has five minarets.
The tallest one is 78 meters.
The mosque will contain 15,000 faithful ones, and the other may be on the outer plane.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, the giant granola and the decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison with mosques in other regions anyway.
In Morocco, Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful people.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has planted lighting, sanitary facilities and financed roads worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, it's us.
Passage of eight league matches without winning the Crown players will try to interrupt Friday's meeting with the Śląska Śląska extra-class vice-lider.
"Our problem is not to return, but to ourselves, we must work on what we are playing," said coach Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round when they defeated 1-0 Benjamina of the Raków Czestochowa games on the way out.
Later, the kielchians recorded two remissions and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Deep Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
"It makes me optimistic that in the last seconds, the ballplayers were fighting for the gate, trying to reinvent it.
Their fall on the ant after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smyła.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be allergic to the team to the game in the side sectors of the field.
"We have an awareness of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.
In Friday's match in Corona, there will certainly be no pause for the extra yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, and there will also be no injured James Žubrowski and Michael Gardaski.
The building is to apply in a cup game for several players with a desire to play.
"We have a headache, it seemed recently that he would be gone and now he is," said Smyla.
Coroner Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the lane of eight league matches in a row without winning, but in the extra class anyone could win with anyone.
"We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and believe it will be Friday already," the footballer noted.
After nine lines of the crown extraclass with a total of five points takes place 15.
Silesia has gathered 12 more and is ranked second.
Friday's match in Kielce will begin at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe.
"42% of the trees on the tree of Europe are at risk," the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in the publication "The Red Book of European Trees" on Friday.
The list is headed by, among others, chestnuts and cranberries.
The IUCN, a organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees present in Europe (and also elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly at risk".
Among the reasons the Red Paper mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, these trees and shrubs, which exist only or mainly on our continent, are most at risk.
With regard to the typical European timber industry, 58% of species are at risk according to IUCN specialists, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the operation of wood, accelerated urbanization, too intensive logging, and in the further sequence of forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and growth are also at great risk.
"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," said Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
"Today PiS wants to bribe the Poles by offering them a free hand for the credit they will have to pay for future generations," Grzegorz Schetyna says in an interview for the "Rzeczpospolite".
In his view, "the whole P.S. policy is pizza."
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken away".
Shetina assures Jack Nizinkiewicz that she has the idea of defeating the law and justice.
It's about mobilising the electorate in electoral urns.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this respect than the Kaczyński Party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PIS, a party that has betrayed its values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetina says.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the president of the Civil Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the KO electoral programme.
"First, nothing data will be collected, but it is necessary to set a course for the future, because PiS deals solely with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is "the launch of Polish energy, aid and investment in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Schetyna explains that in the program KO found a project that will give the least profitable Poles more than 614 zlotys per hand and more profitable – even after several hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for publishing.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can do, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers bid against the extradition opposition, until the financial collapse of the country has finally occurred," he stressed.
Schetyna also stated in his interview with "Rz" that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Praise moves before falling.
Kaczyński is a man of state like Banas is crystal," he added.
The leader of PO also said that he had not decided yet whether to apply for leadership of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Big Condors Dead · Global Voices
Six large condoms were found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The giant condors were probably poisoned by a means of killing predators such as cougars, foxes, or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic fallout.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condoms were adults.
"It is a great loss to the environment, because the condom must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk but all other forms of life, including human health”, he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on the granting of the head of the state of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dude’s firm – we read in “The Republic”.
According to the paper, it is the golden chain of the White Eagle Order, the royal insignia officially called the interwar jewel of the Republic.
It was probably the last time Ignacy Mosticki used it.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can reach Andrzej Dudy's arms.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, Law and Petition voted on Wednesday to amend the Orders and Designation Act to restore it.
The Journal states that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of heads of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.
This time, the work is quick.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, believing that they would consult the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote President Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate Commission continued and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The President's office answered us briefly: it is in favour of restoring this," said Commissioner Robert Mammothov of Pis, quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive through a crossroads
Police action will be conducted, inter alia, at the intersection of the Sieplinski al. Pilsudski.
The uniforms have to do with recent complaints by the city's authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27th, the police are launching preventive activities in Rzeszów “Transitional Crossroads”.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: crossings without the possibility of descent, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at a crossroads, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city a few days ago.
His words were heard at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate car movements after intersections, resulting in traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not texting while driving.
The topic was taken over by Russian police officers, who are starting the “Transitional Crossroads” campaign today.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of crossing restrictions by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to the increase of traffic and traffic congestion.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect cross-parking.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity, late movement from the signalizers, free crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
At what intersections will action take place?
Among other things, on the street of Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellonian Street; the Teplinsky from Pilsudski Al.; the Targow Street from Pilsudski Al.; the Śreniawitów Square from Dubrowski Street or Hetmanski Street from the Warsaw Uprisings.
This type of stock in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held on the following Friday October.
They checked out the waste disposal company from "Czajka"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wolomiński and the Regional Inspection of Construction Control checked the installation in the municipality of Zelonka on Friday, where waste from the "Czaka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of," said the spokesman, Mr. Karol Szyszko.
The Wolomiński mayor's inspectors carried out checks at the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zelonka.
The private Trade and Transport Facility "Dar-Trans", under a contract with the capital waste treatment plant "Czaja", performs waste management services.
"A survey of the installation was carried out and the trader was asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the supervisory report would be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in Dar-Transa was carried out by the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out samples, measurements and studies of groundwater, nor did it have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludges from the “Cyja” sewage treatment plant.
After verification of the WIPO, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The private Trade-Transport Plant "DAR-TRANS" Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stable municipal sewage from the "Cycha" treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to dispose of waste in the area of production, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Greenland.
The Warsaw City Company Waterworks and Canalization reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOSJ was excluded from operation, which was related to the damage to one of the combustion plants.
According to the MPWK, the monthly cost of their exports was PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Małgorzata Kidava-Błońska.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wałęsa said to Małgorzata Kidawy-Błońska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me," replied the candidate of the Civil Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the Ko list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that he is "only a pensioner" in Poland as far as the situation is concerned.
Małgorzata Kidava-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office on Friday at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre.
In a short conversation behind the closed door, the son of Valása – Jarosław took part.
"You have done a difficult task," Lech Wałęsa said.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to us all.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support you as much as possible," said the former president, turning to Kidawa-Blonski.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Błońska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that we can make other smart policies together, but in accordance with the Constitution, according to the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and that is how we want to change Poland," stressed Kidawa-Błońska.
Kibic on retirement
Vales said in a conversation with journalists that he is now “only a retired retiree. ”
"Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope we can reverse the course of events, that what was good, verified, (to this) we will return.
The three divisions of power are the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are essential.
And all of this needs to be cleaned, all of this needs to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have the street criteria," said Lech Wałęsa.
"That is why it is so important for the Poles to go to the elections, think about it and decide for themselves.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Błońska.
"The last chance that we will use the card to improve the state of things in Poland," the former president replied.
"We have to build a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidava-Błońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make this obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move any further."
ME Networkers: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinal.
On the hot ground in Lublan, Polish netizens worked with Slovenians in the semifinals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead.
"White Reds" lost 1:3 and won the brown medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate has adopted without amendment a law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Law on the Property of the Families of State Officials, without amendment, 14 opposed, and three abstained.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had a law to "civilise" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of their children, the children of the spouse, the children who are fit to remain in the joint household with the person required to make a statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Property of the Families of the Most Important State Officials, whose project was established in the Office of the Prime Minister, was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions provide that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, Members of the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the General Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the persons at the head of other State institutions, will be obliged to include in the property statement information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common use.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Lot Register.
55 senators, 12 opposed, and four abstained.
In accordance with the law, every President's flight will be a flight "on an official mission".
On flights, the President will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight to the official mission of the Prime Minister and the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be carried out "in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during flight.
According to the rules on board the aircraft, the members of the delegation may be invited Members, Senators, representatives of the public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, if there is any doubt about the flights of the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will seek clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the time limit set, the head of the KPRM will be required to notify the head of the Sejm or the Senate of the lack of possibility of organising such a flight.
A New Plenipotentiary From Sports
Waldemar Paluch has appointed his Plenipotentiary for Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism.
He was Arthur Svetek, longtime president of the AZS PWSTE Jarosław University Club, the director of the Office of the Rector of the Jarosław University for the last four years.
Bartholomew's Pacek Arthur Světek was recently heavily involved in the project of reactivation of basketball in Jaroslav.
Arthur Christmas is not an anonymous character in the Jarosław sports environment.
Graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in Biała Podlaska since 2002 has been an instructor at the State Technical and Economics School in Jarosławia and has served as President for 15 years
The Poles, after first training in Paris, are waiting for the last rival.
Polish netizens held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a bronze medal on Saturday.
Vitala Heynen's way of winning the title was closed by Thursday's defeat with Slovenes 1:3 in Lublan.
It was loud about their troubles with the trip to this match.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went along with the Slovenian charter to Paris, and a few hours later they were trained in the famous hall of Bertie.
According to the story of the people present in the class, the world's champions' trainer was underwhelmed.
As Assistant Heyna Michał Miško Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of retinal elements.
"We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all this as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that semifinal failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to the ground.
Without a second opinion, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back at that game.
We discussed this game with each other in the staff, and the coach talked to the players a lot.
As two main causes of failure, I would point to failure in the attack and far worse than usual dealing with the situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better in this respect than we were," he analyzed.
In his view, the "White Red" did not become an obstacle to the stress associated with the action against the crowd supported by the loud and numerous owners of the tournament.
He admitted that the world's champions could've put the smooth way to the semifinals.
"Perhaps if we had failed in a similar way in the group phase, we would have examined this lesson more quickly and then we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a twirl," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger of the Poles' Thursday defeat will be turned into an aggression in a bronze match.
"I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's something to fight about.
Recently we won the Me Medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two group meetings they went to Appeldoorn and moved to Lublana to the semifinals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a fine of $25,000, in six months' suspension, for his words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour is losing patience for Kyrgios, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offences of the most unscrupulous professional tennis player in recent years seems dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a heavy fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a furry athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been developing for a long time and has achieved his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of conduct on and off the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsympathetic behavior, insulting the judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during a lost match with Karen Chachanov – after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, he paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play for long, but he was able to say publicly that ATP’s activists were “disrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the above-mentioned ruling on suspending the start and the following fine.
He was forgiven, however, after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.
In the justification, however, tennis players stated that the investigation had shown that Kyrgios’ behaviour over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious objections and was almost a continuing violation of the rules that he had repeatedly offended people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence the high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering him to comply within the next six months with several conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, he can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of the existing professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy the rocket, fight with the judges and the public, nor any other way to behave indecently and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during the tournaments and also after the season to consult with those who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgios's first comment to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have a two-week break, as in the Lavera Cup, the damage to the boat worsened, so he had to give up the nearest launches in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6 – 13 October).
In the ATP ranking, Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot.
GUS: Poland is getting better
A report published Friday by the GUS on household budgets shows that as a good or rather good situation, up to 44% of them assessed their material situation.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the household situation, it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1 per cent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad compared to 11.2 per cent earlier and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best situation is the material situation of households of self-employed people.
In this group, over 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole there are households of renaissants, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a major impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
Parents who raise their offspring alone know the worst, of which 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childrenless households 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single parents and multi-parent families (with at least three children).
To improve the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poles is to reflect rapid income growth, primarily from work.
That is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at voivodship level there is no clear link between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best estimates are formulated by Opolska voivodship residents, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are still Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Western Pomeranian (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolski, the administrative income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was below 94% of the national average and in Lubusk 98%.
The highest incomes were the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average, in Poland, the revenue per person was PLN 1693.
In real terms (after the price adjustment) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Back in the last few years, it's a pretty low score.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also inhibits spending growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person actually increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory revenue, while in 2014 it exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the air carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board the USS George H. W. Bush – an American Navy report.
In the last two years, five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three marines shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush cooped off the coast of Virginia.
To date, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Besides, death is supposed to be unrelated.
"It is necessary for everyone to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions related to the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander on Facebook.
Nessilowski critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In a conversation with Piotr Leksytski, Stefan Nisiolowski stressed that in 1981, John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, his every opinion was accepted."
Then came a criticism of some of his actions.
"To me, that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Ridzik is a great shadow on his pontification.
After all, this redemptor, the pest of the Church and Poland, developed his media at the best in the life of Pope Pole," he explained.
Former PO politicians admitted: “There were glimmers of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once he did not accept Ridzika, but he had authority and could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors," explained Nisiolowski.
"Besides that fatal case of paedophilia and the activities of the Church, and in fact their absence, has come to light.
I ran a little forward thinking, but I wanted to pay attention to the shape of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been relatively recent.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," Nisiolowski said in a conversation with the journalist.
In an assessment of former Polish policy, the Church is an ally of PiS.
"We must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, and crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are literary, became a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the writing regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Ridzik are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it, and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come to pay for it," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that Pope Francis will drive Jedraszewski, Ridzik and a few others of this type," he summed up.

PZPN's been pouring bordards in the stadiums.
Disqualified Graph
The launch of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherow and Lechia Gdańsk with a small hair did not end tragically when the shooters from Wejherow’s millimeter race passed the goalie of the opposite team, Zlatan Alomerovici.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case has imposed a severe penalty on Griff, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the season 2020/2021.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed in the next match at their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to the league games until December 31st.
Burdy at Widzewa Stadium Łódź also called the Silesia Wrocław fans.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this regard.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the loins sector to be overturned with ducks, burning chairs and forcing the host sector.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the water cannon.
PZPN punished Sląsk with a one-time ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the subsequent issue of PP.
The ban on departures also included the league's Extraclasses, but it will continue until December 31st.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKIA of the Reichs
The implementation of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the recording of foreign city names on road signs also started on Podkarpacie in Polish.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, the changes will be made to 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's supposed to be easier, easier, easier.
The new guidelines are due to the amendment of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the towns in neighbouring countries often also have Polish sounds.
Thanks to the change we have made in law, they will finally appear on our paths.
The introduction of the new marking starts with the sub-karpaki section of the A4 motorway," said Andrzej Adamczyk, Minister of Infrastructure.
On the Sub-carpage, the changes will be made to 94 road signs set up on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 grand.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How's the idea coming out?
It's going to take place without a license plate exchange, on the principle of stickers.
They will now replace the functional names of the new village, written in Polish on the existing signs.
Both names will be recorded in one row – first in Polish and then in the original, in the string.
This will be a great relief for those who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windshield.
In a pond in Zamecno in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed swans having problems with wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turns out that someone made an animal a target – a windbreaker was found in his body.
‘He received information about the early bird from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Novi Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to a place.
There was something very wrong with him right away.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to hurt him or expose him to additional stress.
The swan was taken and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of him.
In his body there were scraps of screws," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, who manages, among others, the rehabilitation centre.
She's taking over at the mall.
"The wounds have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the centre where they spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly so far.
Letting him go would now involve that he probably won't survive the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff will release him to the same pond in the spring after the swan’s rehabilitation.
The authorities of the municipality of Žukowice intend to inform the prosecutor of the matter after receiving information on the contribution of the animal's poor health.
The event took place in Zaměčno
Gowin: "we must encourage Polish small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, leader of the Agreement, said on Friday.
Govin spoke in the "Day Signals" on Radio Unit said that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that the problem was very difficult to deal with, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government had tried to deal with it at the beginning of the term of office, but had received a "contrary from the KE".
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will return to this topic," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem of small trade".
"There will be a question of whether the government, the state has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering that Polish retail tax was unlawful public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act introduced two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from the income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from the income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened a procedure for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then concluded that danin had been put into effect in a manner incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU press reported to the PAP that the case is currently in writing, at which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether or not the oral procedure, that is, the hearing of the parties and the possible trial, will proceed.
It takes a few months to make a good appeal.
"This procedure lasts an average year," the PAP said in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you dress a child for baptism?
We're pushing up a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and its parents.
It is often the first opportunity for the entire family to focus on the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.
No wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about the child’s clothing, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
Because in shops you can find a lot of hardware kits that do not provide the kid with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of a child
Up until recently, the baptism of a few weeks - old infant was arranged in white sets and placed in the same beechlike or large air.
Today, children who approach the sacrament are often older: several months, annual, and even larger.
It is easy to imagine that such great comfort needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
So if your child is three to four months old on the day of baptism, he is likely to be in a wheelchair or on the hands of parents or christenings.
The best way out of this is to dress him up in comfortable, cottony sleeping or sets.
Although this element of wardrobe is considered to be a daily outfit, it is enough to find its festive options, such as a falbank or a crown.
For the boy, the perfect points will be printed with a print of the shells and shells.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have a bigger fantasy in your dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tiul dress
Many of the parents of girls who miss looking towards richly decorated, falsified dresses for baptism in a set of coats, belts, and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathless materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the right outfit will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant clothes on cotton linings.
Delicate, tiulian skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and lovely sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Ideal outfit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Up until recently, the boy’s parents had fashion for suits that were a copy of the “adult” models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or helmets often made young elegances loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were forged by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, sweatshirts, and the blouse decorated with the front of the vest.
These machines look extremely festive, and at the same time they don't bother the movements of a young man who knows the world.
Krystyna Pavlovicz published a property statement
Krystyna Pavlovicz made a property statement at the end of her term of office.
It turns out that the P.I.S. has collected 110,000 PLN of savings.
Let us remind ourselves that Pavlovicz announced that he would leave politics.
By the end of his term of office, he has an amount of PLN 110,000
According to the statement made by the messenger, she is retiring at a monthly rate of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pavlovič owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a little less, which he rents with 880 PLN a month.
The message also invests in industrial metals, appreciating the investment of PLN 150,000.
Jarosław Kaczyński also published a property statement earlier.
Voting on the adjournment of the deliberations of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day recess in the deliberations of the Municipal Chamber during the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has asked for.
289 Members spoke against – 306.
Normally, the Chamber of the Municipalities does not hold a meeting during a party conference, so that the Members do not have to give up their participation in them or in Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the government, there were 289 Members against 306.
Two opposition parties already following the conventions
The lack of consent for a recess may be taken as political revenge against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that it is unlawful and non-existent) and that it does not wish to apologize for it.
Following this ruling, the House of the Municipales resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson has rejected the opposition's blockade of brexit and the avoidance of early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit needs to come so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, health care, cost of life.
Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The conference of the Conservative Party is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday, 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave in explaining the long suspension of Parliament was that of a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," says foreign media.
The president's speaker has clearly disputed these reports.
"It's just not true," wrote Blaze Spyalski on Twitter.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", say Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in New York, declared that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He spoke to Israel’s foreign minister Katz, who said in February that “the Poles sent out anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating remarks made by its politicians.
He also mentioned acts of aggression against the Polish Ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: “Polack, Pole. ”
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to the Spichalski portal, "it was invented".
According to the speakers “JI” during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, named Commander of the Order of merit by Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that the Jews of Israel are "such as Israel's Katac" responsible for the increase in anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, he was to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who's Banas and what's he guilty of?
The stone house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banasia's estate statements.
We're summarizing another affair that rocked the ruling camp.
TVN's “Superviser” journalists have revealed that Marian Banasz, president of the Supreme Audit Chamber, has not entered in the statement of a 400-metre property stone that is located on the Krakow Podgory.
Moreover, his tenant had sex business in the above-mentioned building (so rent rooms per hour).
On the other hand, the building itself was allegedly a guarantee for the repayment of the loan from 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularity in the Superviser program.
The journalist revealed that they had rented a stone from Banas to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Customers were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banas' charges were answered vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, a well rented by pimps led a journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The quarry itself was described in a vague way, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
"Marian Banassi's mother and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 million and PLN 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings ....]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the portal analysis, Banasia's own quarry was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Marian Banasia's assets statements for 2015-2019.
Banas announced that until its completion he would suspend his activities at NI. "I will go to your marshals for a free vacation," he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
"We do not hear that the CBA expands its investigation or accelerates the examination of Marian Banas' property statements.
That is why we are forced to benefit the authorities of the State and to make a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said Mr Maricz Witczak.
"If the normal Pole so severely underestimated the rent of his property, he would already have 10 checks, tax home and a fine-tuning procedure," he added.
He's high, he's low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Audit Chamber.
This position was appointed on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was notified by the Law and Justice and the votes of the party's politicians adopted.
Earlier Banas was associated with the NI in 1992-2005, acting in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas held the post of President of the Customs Service and also the Deputy Secretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat on the table of the Head of Customs and has managed the National Treasury since 2017.
Banas served for 3 months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.

"Richpopolita": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished
According to the paper, disregarding a specific order issued by a police officer is intended to be a new type of offence, threatened by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
Police unionists want to make such a change.
The idea came to the petition committee's meeting.
"The case is serious, because more than half a million crimes are already being brought to Polish courts every year," we read.
The ‘Rzeczpospolita’ found that the petition that the Independent Police Union wrote to the Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences had a chance of success.
The petitioners propose the new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: ‘Whoever is not subject to the request or order of a public official issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law is subject to the penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of liberty’.
"Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who do not follow orders, prevent or make it difficult to perform their duties," the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "The Republic" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in political manifestations.
"In situations of free demonstration, it would be unfavourable and, instead of mitigating the situation, would even exacerbate it," he adds.
Statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have positively assessed police intervention in 2018 and that they take 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jakom Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar Czech dramaturgies, today listed in one line with Václav Havel.
Thus, from the beginning, the curse of talent was hanging over Jahchem.
Eight years later, he came back with "The Amazing Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonja, along with two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound, and for the other time he stopped in the baby days.
But it's not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
They are all just the background for observing a world where there is no room for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of crowded provinces, old, suspicious people's societies, and delinquent youth.
"Awesome man" turns places into an absurd theater.
Narration imitates didascalia, and hero talk creates this world.
The scene is Europe full of fear for its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to bankruptcy problems related to Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but the timers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Gandhi also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on the trips bought at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
As of Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company's mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office was then calmed down that the customers who bought the tours in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday on Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of the last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
Believers demanded that, in addition to the 900 million-pound rescue plan already agreed in August, the company obtain an additional 200 million as a winter insurance when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have grown for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

"I don't think Slovenia has played fantastically.
We're the ones who played very weakly.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for the review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of German Görlitz.
Actions are designed to help combat the gradual decline in the number of people living in the city.
Görlitz is the eastmost city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel old lady attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant challenges.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a constant loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left to the west of the country, which resulted in a 25 percent drop in the city’s population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000.
To combat the population, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been made to the programme.
Two thirds of them built large cities.
The program was also attended by people from Hungary, Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will be held permanently, the main objective of the programme is to get an opinion from the programme participants.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme to pay promising young professionals for their lives and jobs in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
