Good day, please don't have the Internet, and I couldn't send it any faster.
Please tell me the exact address for the cleaning tomorrow, what key code and what time are the guests leaving tomorrow, and the new guests moving in?
Unfortunately, I have to give up your offer because I've really found a job by now.
I'm sorry, but I can't say no.
I sometimes feel that my thinking in Czech is different from what I have written in Ukrainian because of the translator.
We promised that if you went to school, we'd surprise you.
Good afternoon, I'll take the course.
However, please indicate whether there is an earlier time.
Because I don't live in Prague, there may be transportation difficulties.
If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
Back in Herson, people went out to a rally, Russians couldn't run.
As the Westerners told the agency, the Hersonians were able to hold a rally before the military troops arrived in the area to launch technology.
"We were there for the rally, now the technique of the rf has arrived," said one of the participants in the event.
In the past, citizens have traditionally gathered for protests in Freedom Square, near the building of the ODA and the Olympus.
This area is now controlled by armed Russian forces, who use weapons against rallyers and kidnap people.
On April 3, Russian armed invaders reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovac.
According to Ukrainform, residents in Donetsk regularly wage peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against people, are injured and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap the inhabitants of the area.
President Vladimir Zelensky honored Herson with the special title "The City Hero."
On February 24, the president of the Rf road began a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are firing at and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket systems, and ballistic missiles.

We can meet for an hour or two and then I'll go home because I don't have the things I need with me.
The red-combined yard pulls the rocket to the trash.
You can protect the TV with the plugin and the remote control, the canisters, the pillows, the chairs, the water heaters.
Oleg also found me a copy of the book, cleaning out the two kivarts that give tourists a day’s work.
The apartments in the center of Prague are located.
Will you be comfortable with me at the bank on Monday?
Good afternoon, so it would be good if you could do it today as you wrote at 5:00.
So I read the Bible, the Koran, to find other answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the house to be cleaned?
I mean, dreams are good dreams?
In addition to this report, I am sending you a list of vacancies that employers are offering us.

They have a ticket for April 20th.
God forbid we're welcome.
When you get there, call me, the doorbell doesn't work.
The cheaper it would be, the better we have to move, because we are not financially pulling European prices..
I need to look at the place and try the places where it hurts.
He wants to push all my painful points now, he knows which.
But it doesn't have any effect on me anymore.
I didn't want to talk to Misha yesterday about him and his drama.
It's impossible to close in the banks with rain.
So I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.
This is my schoolmate Ukrainian.
Alexandra here runs from one corner to the other, there are so many things in her eyes that she wants to be everywhere at the same time.

Did you mean that we clean ourselves and you just control?
Why don't we switch with Valya in the morning, and I'll switch in the afternoon?
My mom's gonna live here in a dorm just like she used to pay for the hostel.
It's important that I have a place to live
Sasha wasn't at school today, so I wrote to the teacher at the post office.
Hi, I'm sick, so we'd better move our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to bake a toast.
In Ukraine, the traditional is borsch, weeds, and others.
I don't have favorites, I like to try different foods in different countries.
How do you like your food?
I want to be busy.
There's a train more specific, and there's no place
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I have my assistant in the kitchen?
It is good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very penniless and comfortable.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me whether or not there will be a brewery for Nazar and when he must come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariupol – the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Zelenski believes that fighting in eastern Ukraine and, in particular, in Mariupol will determine the course of war – and if the USS is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
Direct language: "Marypool is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's fighting. We're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have taken on a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east, in the OOS region, and if they are stronger, the more close we will be to the victory table, and we will have the advantages of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all of these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we've been deposing.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our outcome, our victory..."
Details: Zelensky also said that negotiating after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity of diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The real language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace at all.
But if we do not speak emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight, but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you still have room for a Czech course for adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Corner Mountain.
And these two are my cousins.
Yeah, I get it.
I'm not sure I'll be able to clean up until 1:00 because there's a big apartment and a lot to clean up.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I won't promise.
I'll write you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominic, who's buying expensive materials?
Is this procedure permanent, or should it be ordered as it ends?
In view of the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new quality state.
It's the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for an analysis of the postmodern context as one where the metaphor plays a role in the axiological criteria
Do you know how to report online that I've been employed and no longer claim to help?

So we're going to work and we're going to work.
Monday we're going to have a leader and we're going to decide how and when we're going to be in our house.
Good, 'cause I'm starting to freak out that I don't get it or get it.
I think it's the right decision, it's better to give quality help to these people than when many people do.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for a temporary shelter in the Czech Republic where my daughter plans to study at the University

Of course we can come, thank you!
5. In addition to Czech, what kind of education would you like for yourself?
How difficult it is:)

I'm going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00-6:20. I'll be home after lunch.
If you have time, we'll try to change the tariff plan tomorrow night.
But today our city was bombed again, and I fear for my son.
And I want to get out of here as soon as possible.

I am temporarily living in Prague 9. Ready to move anywhere if there is work.I will be very grateful for advice or suggestions)
But if you don't want to talk to me, I miss it.
Why did you believe that you did not need such experience?
Every situation is given for something.
Usually, a person should change, especially spiritually.
I'll give you that money when the bank approves.
About $30,000 in debt, which you have plus $30,000 to keep you.
Janka, I hope you're okay, and your grandmother won't call me bad words.
I'm trying to get Sasha to sleep. I need him to get some sleep.

A list of Russian military personnel involved in war crimes in Butch Kyiv region was published by the Ministry of Defense's Chief Intelligence Directorate.
According to U.S.Newsweek, the U.S. Department of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense reports on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
MO Ukraine's GUR has obtained a list of 64 separate motorcycle crews who are directly involved in war crimes against the Ukrainian people in Butch," the report reads.
In GUR, MOU notes that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ukrainform, Irpin, Butch, Gostomel, and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the city head Butchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Vendiktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of murdered civilians were taken out from Russian invaders of the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, announced the start of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders fire and destroy key infrastructure objects, mass shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and aircraft.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'm going to Canada soon.
Right behind the track, there's a regular name, there's a slang at the risk, there's a slang expression in the parentheses, there's a shortcut that's used on the schedule of hours.
I don't want to bother you. Rest.
I was looking at the weather forecast.
I don't need a brandy.
Just nice clothes at normal prices and to be sized.
We were at the railway station store.
The professions that they offer, are they possible without language?
It's important, if there's such a tradition, I need to know to prepare)
I thought after a week, but we're in a bad mood, sirens.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank every person for the experience, even if he is painful.
I feel that I have learned from every situation so as not to make mistakes in the future.
Directives are made in the form of numbered written additions that are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people have the same celebrations this week.
This depends on religion.
Whether there's a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic.
At first, you can try it for free.
Why don't you write us an algorithm for payment, we'll pay for it.
We have that paper that kids get at the end of the school year, that's a table, and they get a witness at birth and they get married.
Yeah, he's on it like an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's better.
It says here that you have to fill out the life story in Czech...
I'll try to make it, because I still have paperwork to sign.
Your wife is not angry that you are on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin for you.
Let them envelop you with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
the place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that if you went to school, we'd surprise you.
I've got two months' rent, the Olomouc area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse from the civilian population to the north of Kiev.
Photographs of people who had been tortured and shot confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how this could have happened in the 21st century!
And I was not surprised at all, but what happened was exactly what I was looking forward to.
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then a co-worker with the kids, and only then did he come back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently assisted the U.S.S.S.A., and I have no doubt for a moment that in the event of occupation, the suburbs of Kiev will not spare my family.
Because I was and I'm absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten communist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he just can't exist, he's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Žitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the great - grandfather’s shooting case was taken off in the U.S.U.S.A.: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the execution sentence is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-door" road, never walked in fortifications.
The fact that they lived on tents and had several cows was enough to imprison the chaff and the nurse of young children to be executed.
The parents did not even know about the burial site.
Grandma said that nearly a hundred people were taken from the village and killed everyone but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In a criminal case, there's the name of a knocker named Shari.
Our former High Council speaker comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if it was his relative who was the CDB informant.
The apple from the apple tree is, as you know, falling...
The firing squad who had conspired to execute the peasants were ethnic Russians.
In his analysis of the great - grandfather’s case, he was interested in various information resources.
There are great (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like the Immortal Barrack, which is a quality reminder of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCSDistists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinic repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers -- the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found child pornography files on the computer, they put her in jail, and she died fast.
The CDBs are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Then why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
It concentrates on the most disgusting traits of human nature.
The top of the thousand-year order tradition was slavery and imperial chauvinism from the 16th to 19th centuries.
And then what happened was an animal genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 "Chekist" half-French movie, that's what it was.
Why did you see my pictures in the bathroom?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough.
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I just wanted to ask you, maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't know them.
Honey, Igor is asking if it's convenient for you to leave tomorrow.
We're not comfortable bothering you that much.
You are very helpful, thank you!
▪ In Borodjanka, under Kiev, seven civilians were found in the process of solving the collapses of two multistory dwellings.
▪ Mariupol’s advocates claimed that an unknown poison substance from a Russian drone would be sprayed over the city.
Three people were injured.
In Russian prisons, about 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held.
Among them were 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which investigates the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 defence companies in the Russian defence sector.
In the past, fighting in eastern Ukraine destroyed one enemy tank, three armoured carriers, three artillery systems, 24 vehicles, one helicopter, and three drones.
Your coffee will be here today)
I have my first bike after my son.
When do girls come back from school, what do they do?
We've come to a place where we've been settled from the center in Pardubice, conditions are good.
But there's a big but there's men living here drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, loud music is just the minimum that "disturbs", the smell of cigarettes drunk men and we and the kids... are having a terrible night's sleep, to be honest.
Please help with the apartment, for the money, please.
But where it's safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like they're smoking right here.
I'm asking you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like.
I'm just praying if you can help me out.
The important thing is that we understand each other.
Very positive, such a beautiful garden, such pleasant educators.
You're doing so much for us, it's amazing, very grateful to you.
Good evening, Stephanie. Agatha wants to play the game. She missed the game.
We're missing that hatch.
So far, we're not ready to pay that kind of money, we're gonna wait for help, and then we're gonna plan something.
How am I supposed to get to the apartment today to clean up?
If I'm at the front door, should I let you know and you'll open it?
I wanted more if I could look somewhere for Karina's cake.
I forgot to write you, I'm sorry.
It went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs, you and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as employee of Fpoint, the first question was how the dog was found when they found the pups.
Everyone's watching the Facebook page.
They asked you to say hello and that they were very interested in reading the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child and the parents didn't understand Czech at all, after work I could help them on the phone.
I need to change my bed linen, two sets.
That's what makes me feel good on the holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to the Easter rituals.
Thank you. Today, I'm going to write down my work data.
The data was very nice, thanks for the organization.

General Chapeke has a very slow turn there.
Everyone has a chance.
It's important that love be real and mutual.
I don't know how in Europe, but in our country people get married for different reasons, mostly useful, Mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love a person, it won't work.
Yeah, we took our aunts home and drove them home right away.
She was very grateful, and she cried.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
She said if it was possible, there might still be an old blanket and a pillow.
But it doesn't have to, only if it does, and I'm very grateful to you, too.
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions about why in my life there are situations that made me give up on everything.
I need to buy some bread and other food.
I just decided to go and you made the congregations.
That's true, but we don't know where it is yet and we don't know where it is. We've been looking for an hour and going back on foot.
Even now, I've been thinking about you, and you've written to me.
Does your father only speak Russian or any other family language?
You can have the kids come to Wali and play in the living room.
All right, then let's take a chance:)
It's nice to meet you, too.
For the apartment she spoke to Volodymyr was counseling or checking me out until they found or looking for the lady who lives with us that we need to go to the subway museum there's an institution that helps find a place to live
For the sake of the little one, I'll cross the barrier.
For some of their questions, I didn't know how to answer them.
That'd be good for Thursday, if you could.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license test yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't fill in the phone because I don't understand the Czech online banking, and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't fill out.
In addition, I can't even change the tariff so that I have normal calls and the internet doesn't fill in the number.
I'm going crazy.
Where's Price, not the cheeks, and the face... the title doesn't sound right what you mean?
I'm ashamed to be out of a job
She just said she was in school.
I'm sorry to bother you, I was just really worried.
But this is closer to leaving Ukraine to know exactly what they're going to do.
Because there's a question in all life right now.
Yes, 10-11 years old, but our dimensions don't match.
I'm looking for everything for the house and the kids.
Thanks to people I've been accepted I live in a chapel they're always asking questions or I need a company and I'm ashamed to say I'm asking myself to find it.
I just got home. I'm having breakfast.
Don't explain anything, please do that I'm not here.
cannot answer without summary sent
Mom, I can't tell you this.
And I'm a little freaked out right now that I couldn't help but feel like we left the apartment tonight.
God give Jura some sleep, maybe I'll just lie down for a while.
I'll write to you anyway.
Hey. Susana, help me. I got paid for March. It's both of us with Julia or just me, I can't figure out why.
Yes, you can make copies of passports when you are comfortable :)
We have one of the best guys in the area in the village.
I'm already having fun talking to you, and I even like to talk to you.
I went to the caritas, and they offered temporary housing for a week or two, but I need a permanent home where I could be with a child and why there's less and less.
The flowers were lit. It's okay. Everyone's resting and very beautiful.
According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 hoods, including a teaching kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also suggested by the Howitzers in the 1.2 billion-euro ATR Boxer version.
While tanks in battle have to climb relatively close to the enemy’s targets, Panzerhabitze 2000 can fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circles, with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self - propelled hoods will follow a circular pattern.
Butesver will give Kiev 100 of its hoods in the shortest terms, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new hoods can be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, or earlier the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is that us in the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we'll find a way to fill in a piece of bread and cream.
I'm going to work tomorrow without a commission, and by the time my doctor gets better, I'll pass the commission right away, okay?
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff package by 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns now?
Hi, I'm sorry. Do you want to know if you need a worker?

I'm young and active, 21 years old.
I'll agree to any job.
I speak Czech at the basic level, but I learn every day, so I think I'll learn everything I need to work out.

If you don't mind, I'll get these pants for work.
You're smart and everything will be fine. Rest, get strong and beautiful with a strong sleep!!

Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman make their own decisions in their family, especially without family involvement.
Can We Be Together?
It'll take some time before we're around.
Why don't you try it this way for now?
I rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.

How much money do I have in this room?
I have to bring it all in.
Since Monday, 4.
4. 2022 refugees from the war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance at a new job in the Prague Market.
The branch office in Hall 29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of aid applications, so there is a translator in place.
Lydia's already in school, but we're gonna go to school on Tuesday. I told her today.
I sit there, I keep headphones on my ears, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat it so that we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the apartment.
I need to be tested for a food license.
Please tell me tomorrow for five guests to prepare the apartment.
Is that the fifth place I know in the TV room?
Disassemble and stow the couch?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one you've been using, but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much space there is so I can't plan anything with furniture wants to finally look at that apartment this week and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry it's been so long, it's been a working day, it's hard to adapt.
Is that enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want you to finally be with me, to have that opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how it feels.
For a child, there's a bed and a bath, so I found something first.
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you had the chance, but don't give me the last one.
I want to do a haircut called a hat.
Oleg's sick, he's dead and coughing.
I'm just gonna be a little bit later, about 8:00. Can I?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried everything's gonna be okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself!
How are you feeling today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up. I slept badly.
Sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that Kolya and I had misinterpreted the test yesterday.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denisenko or Jonashek)) to help me with some mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be of use to them too.
If that's possible, I want to raise mathematical terms on the weekends.
Geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with Kolya to make sure there's no mistake.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We hope so, too.
So she's very happy with any present.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech issue
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met with Victoria, Ukraine.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thanked God for this girl because she was the first person in Ukraine to feel my heart reciprocate.
The branch office in Hall 29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of aid applications
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
Don't worry, I'm a simple man.
So she won't be afraid that no one's coming.
I didn't go, I baked it myself, I can do it, but what's important is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babin Yar Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He was talking about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation must be protected – it is also part of our responsibility in connection with our history."
If "evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved to death the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and made them die of disease.
Russian forces are firing massively at Ukrainians, even visually similar to the shootings in Baba’s Yar.
For over a month, the Germans have seen it in real - time news.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been so long ago unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than taking a stand against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without the risks and casualties to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.

We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be gathered

This is the gift I use instead of punishment.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO, and only 18% were in favour.
After the Dignity Revolution, Victor Yanukovich's escape, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbassi war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, and supporters, on the other hand, grew.
After a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's accession and NATO's assistance in the context of the war, there are now many criticisms at the expense of the Alliance and the member states -- for the timely supply of arms, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to annoy Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will have to give up its desire for membership in the Alliance through the position of the RF if it can stop the war and Ukraine will have reliable security assurances, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the "Cursed Questions" podcast, together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is being criticized in vain, why our prospects for NATO membership are nearer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees that are being discussed in negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I have a partner in my volt that's marked as my application for review.
I was giving it to you because of this mobile app.
There is no visa, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was designed in Poland, and the visas were not given, but the pesals were given.
We'll write it down for you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
I made an appointment with a boy from Ukraine who met with him yesterday, to meet him at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause I don't like it that way. I'm not long enough.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting machines to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting there for three or four years, and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And take it with you for 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a heart disease.
I had genuine feelings for this man, but he did not do so well and I abandoned him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then, after a while, he telephoned him for heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
At that time, I began to have problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
That is why God has determined our fates.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very pleased to have a place to live now and have a place to stay with the baby.
Did you have to mention it to me before?
Because I helped see the kids in the family.
Don't apologize, just write some sentences I didn't understand.
I myself understand that the translator does not always correctly translate the text
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, does she have to give the paper?
It must have been the guests who forgot. I put it in the closet.
You may need to go to bed to work tomorrow
Can anyone help you, you need things for a woman the size of XS or S the size of 165. And also for her daughters (8.10.12 years)Thank you.
That time in the ice, I bought two packs, and my mom bought two.
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
Okay, give me something else, or I'm not sleeping, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming of being bombed...
God is never late, his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the value of unskilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I'm not going to be able to have here and the money I made at home, and I'm not going to get here now either.
But just sit there and I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts go down so we have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are prepared from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at another time, they can simply wait.
Vladimir returned at 4 a.m.
So we took them to our home.
We slept with Vika in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write it down and find out what's next...
Or maybe I don't have a place anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian kids who are going to go to high school.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's comfortable.
I don't know yet, but I'd like to get the kids to a garden and a school.
It's better if we change things sometimes?
I'm sorry, I really don't have missed Wednesday calls.
I offer work, toilet and toilet cleaning, washing three windows, dusting.
Work is about 3-4 hours, 800 grams one time, from 19.04 Tuesday, from 2.00 p.m.
I hope to tell you we're doing just fine.
Can I call you back?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
I want to ask you what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask for some advice.
We have Hannah as the root of the name Anya.
He handed her over to his uncle from the house.
Made an English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
So Monday and Wednesday are different?
Thank you so much, you're doing so much for our family, and we're all so grateful to you.
Help is needed to be in the pool
But that's my opinion.
My uncle handed her a roll and a skateboard from her house, and she rode them home, so that's what she's got.
I also got up at 9:00, and I'm just making breakfast.
I'm very ashamed that you're talking to me on your weekend.
We'd like to report a change of dwelling and file documents at the same time.
We're now giving medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there'll be a snack tomorrow.
One of my moms said she was baking doughnuts for the kids.
He's coming to see you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule of cleaning apartments a month ahead, even if you have a close understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.
The Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: they say "we didn't do it before."
Conashenko's direct language: "We see attempts at diversions and attacks by Ukrainian troops on objects in RF territory.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been held."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the first days of the full - scale invasion of the Russian occupying forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, Russian rockets that hit the Ukrainian PPO hit a multi - apartment building on the Poznaki capital.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multistory platform on Valery Lobanowski’s prospectus.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV set on the road near Baba’s Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building over the South Railway Station.
March 14th, a wreck of a broken rocket of invaders smashed up a house and a trolleybus in Kurenovac, Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential facility on the Vineyard, killing one person, wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern Retroville TRC on the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
Mer Kieva Vitaly Klitschko, who declared on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital who had been evacuated from the city were still too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still strike at Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ammunition in the capital.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's main intelligence department warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to start a series of attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the Russian army's brutality against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia as a result of an air raid by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of bilgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian projectile" had fallen near the city.
Apparently, both in Washington and in Berlin, the elite are in a cold sweat, thinking that the Nazi exterminators will be beating Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky doesn't talk to them as much as he does with their voters and their societies in general.
By his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the areas of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was unreachable to any of his predecessors.
Greensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine; he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this elegant raft of strength, the touching and the times of despair, gradually reach their goal.
By the time Biden is firmly against the closing of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against speeding up Ukraine’s entry, this process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want them to think we're frauds.
The cost you collect is better given to those in need.
I can come to you and we'll figure it out.
But the air is clean, it's plus .
It says here that I have the "One on Two without Internet" tariff, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any other rooms today, or is it just the stairs upstairs?
So I'm on my way and you're on the train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This loan is done by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, can I give her the password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot a friend.
Great, then my husband's gonna give me a ride because he's got a car from the construction company where he works today.
How happy and grateful we are that our daughter and Nick are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!

I offer curative massages, a rehab room for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech.
Contact: ------I'd like a letter so that the Czechs can write to you through a translator, the text doesn't go here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if you get a call, you don't get home.
You really don't want that yarn?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to do with it.
If you don't need a prime list, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
Actually, today I'm just asking for your attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I'm asking for more patience.
Are you okay with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You're planning on buying that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't accept that.
He's messing with the old reality.
You call work, find out whether you're going to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something's clear.
There's hope... it's not long.
Now... make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone, I don't have anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders have not paid any wages at our jobs.
Where am I supposed to go?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
I don't know how many kids ask for candy, and you can't.
And from every harvest, we don't have one.
We have a choice to stay there and put our children in danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with those hearts and those things that the kids gave her when she came to school.
I should have called me when you came.
I'll write you in dinner.
Yes, I only believe in God and trust him with my life
I don't have the strength to do all this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to talk.
I figured it out on the menu, I even ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, community?
If so, what kind of species is it?
Please send a page with a visa or a travel stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libusch, did you pay for the mangers?
Because I don't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yes, I understand that's very good.
I'm going to throw you a picture of the lady's card I'm teaching English.
Well, if you write tomorrow, whether we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough. It's so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow?
How do you feel about the first week?
Karina brought us medicine yesterday, and we drink it.
I can work with lying sick and disabled children
But I have to say that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
Can I wash your laundry soap?
Because there's only antibacterial gel.
I'm not gonna tell you, because I'm not really in town yet.
What services/activities do you think are needed/not available for older people?
I don't know, because there was no text from the bank yet, and I didn't get the bank card, and the kids deleted the bank apps, so they really upset me.
Then write me a letter about how you're going to go
Today we have the joy of our city of Butcha being liberated from the invaders, saving our armies.
They're cleaning up the enemy, looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city's being replaced, the exchange is about to begin.
And John would see if there was anything there to fix or do anything else.
Diana, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our panas wants to stay at home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll cook the pet and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
They're tractors that actually go out in the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to travel to temporarily occupied areas in rubber convoys today to take help and take people from there.
These are heroic leaders who travel unafraid to the war zone, calm down and help the refugees in the carriages, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to get into the humanitarian carriages.
These are the drivers who stood on the Lifetime Route in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
They are utility workers who take out garbage under fire, repair plumbing, and power lines to provide the people with the necessary supplies.
They are doctors and nurses, who save people 24 hours a day without complaining, and they volunteer at the leisure, collecting first aid kits on the front.
We have in Ukraine, we stop juice when we have little leaves)
Please tell me, little children-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is that acceptable?
I'm looking for an apartment for me and my daughter for three or four days every day to come to the Czech Republic and hand over passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the visa center who don't work online.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it's taking a long time on the train, it's going to be hard for the baby.
So I decided to look for a place in or near Prague.
No, we're good.

It's okay. I'll get used to new realities.
I don't like it very much, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the post, the most important thing is that it's true.
Yeah, the TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to respond to some Czech boys at 1300 and help carry them.
I want to go to your place, give you a big hug and kiss you.

I'm on the phone with everyone I know from Lviv, a lot of people died.
The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, I think.
Until then, they put the stamps like this, and then they likened these images to carts.
Ukraine's foreign constituency (UCC) is a constituency that unites polling stations located outside Ukraine and consists of voting facilities in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and military bases abroad,[Visa 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DRC Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is played by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only state-level ballots are held: the election of the President and the People’s Deputies and the nationwide referendums.
Local elections are not held in the PPE.
They're at the station next to the mother and child's room.
He says he doesn't understand where they're going anymore.
Are you mad at me?
I'm going to remove the photo in the bathroom.
I don't need money anymore. I borrowed money from a long-term friend.
I was going to say that I already connected the Czech mobile number.
So I didn't need another device, so I went to O2, and they gave me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm not comfortable, Sunday's working and I can't anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, puff blankets, plates. Kids don't have pajamas and nothing to revel in.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10:00... write the address again, the text is missing.

Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello (
Very tasty apples, what kind is that?
President Andry Jermak's Chief of Staff has announced that Russia is launching a "fake operation" on the weapons that allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jeremiah is, "They understand they're losing war, they see their backwardness, and they want to "beat" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fairies is the destruction of S-300 from Slovakia.
This information has already been corrected by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next, we know Russian scenarios, I'll call one of them.
They can launch fairy tales that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from allies, and they are moving massively into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn these fairies right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the U.S.S. military are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
Excuse me, have you forgotten to ask how much it costs to garden in the months and will it work in the summer?
Each one is given his or her strength.
There are far more sad stories, believe me.

Your father may have told us that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However, she is baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions that are based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and began to read the Torah.
I believe that there are no mediators between man and God.

Well, did you click on the links I sent you above?
Each one of them has a free offer of housing, description, contact with the owner, and photo.
I can't get in touch with an e-mail, but I'm afraid I can't get any closer to the Czech Krumlov, and now we're living in Prague.
Then I won't help you, there's no way in Brno.
Thanks for the help, we found a place to stay, but we need a bed and a sofa maybe you can tell us where to buy it not expensive because the budget is weak, thank you very much

We cleaned the whole room and went to the other room.
The International Society continues to express shock and resentment after evidence has emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a “provoking”.
“Reports of murdered, raped and severely injured by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are condemned,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kissida called the incidents “a violation of international law”.
The announcements came after reports of hundreds of civilians being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, Butchi by Russian troops leaving the area after a few weeks of occupation.
Photographs of the supposedly executed civilian bodies with their hands tied together shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Butch.
"What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to make a genocide in Butch.
"We will do everything we can to ensure that those who commit these war crimes do not remain unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on national television late April 3, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zaharov dismissed the charge as a “provocation. ”
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO had ordered images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, I think the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these materials came into existence does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," said Zechariah.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defence also claimed without evidence that the image of Butchi was “an additional display of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provoking of Ukrainian radicals" in Butch.
The next committee of Russia announced on April 4th a statement announcing a "investigation" on the charge of spreading "certainly false information" to Ukraine about the actions of Russian troops in Butch.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky spoke on April 3rd, accusing Russian troops of committing genocide in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Butch to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelensky said in a video address, going from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and headless, I don't understand," he said about the victims' scenes scattered on the streets of Butchi, the city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A reporter for the Ukrainian Radio Freedom Service on April 2 saw the small city of the bodies as civilians on the streets.
In just one place, the reporter saw up to ten bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine -- all civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that locals said was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from a short distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which was controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, it's all there is. We bought everything on the list.
"They were told that Kiev was gone." "How the invaders took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus."
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
There's another item on this list that's much less information at the moment -- the local population's being transported to the enemy's territory.
About mid-March, Russian invaders "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements into their territory and territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually placed under the Russian military range.
Ukrainian Truth has found the Ukrainians and their relatives who have been deported to investigate how the same evacuation is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and beyond.
Fortunately, they're alive and in touch with their families.
However, in view of the statements made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took the children out of there without the parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian champion from the sailing of Joseph Zacepinski.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Wali, moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, located two miles from the village.
The family settled in a military town, even though it was civilian.
Like the real plastics, Dennis and Marina picked up the alarm bags in advance, but they didn't make it out in the morning of February 24th.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone else.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor's house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, some 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24th, people came to the driveway who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They say, "Who's there?" I say, "Come out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there was a weapon.
All men were questioned whether they were in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you under the direction of Ramzan Kadirov."
It was Chechnya's OMON, not even the army, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "We were helped in the war by the Ukrainian, Sasko White (commanded by the UNA-UNSO Nationalist Viking movement, who fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-Czechnya War -- UP), and now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say the water was a big problem.
They broke down the store, they took the goods from there, and they brought us six bottles anyway.
There's a video on the Internet where the kids are thanking Kadir for the food.
So after they robbed the store, they brought sausage and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmadovich."
Nobody particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have 7 days to give us our phones," they laughed.
They also kept separate from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came, because they didn't want the wars, they support the Ukrainians, and they're really good, "Putin is a bastard, Kadir's son, but there's nothing we can do about it, because there's our families there."
Most of the time, they didn't fight, but they went to shoplifting, looting.
The hens were tied up, one tied to one leg, and the other tied to their white scotch and called it "the militia."
They came to Ukraine unprepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten on Butch, so they didn't even take the killed, they said to us, "Do you have any artillery?"
What's more, we've had our crews together -- Chechens didn't know each other, they've been asking for passwords in the first few days to find out whether they were their own or their own.
We had them until March 13th, and then the Russian OMON came and followed them with an ombudsman.
They put 30 to 40 units of technology between the houses -- ours always came from the Byractaires.
But these came and told us that the U.S.S.S. is gone, but there's "Azov," and they said, "Azova" is 100 thousand in Ukraine.
Naratius "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been on the move since early March.
One day a Russian -- or a desantu officer, or a representative of the FSB -- came to us and said there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Butch, Hostomel, we were thinking maybe the green corridor was given to us.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus and then maybe Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
What they said was, "Pity your children's psyche!"
How it worked, they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house, either the towns, or the mortars.
And then it flew back in, and the neighborhood buildings just burned down, and some of them fell down.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country, saying, "You're going to get shot there, you're going to be sold to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were highways, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the technology right next to them.
There's a lot of capons, buried tech, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian Komar Pass, we went through improvized control, many people were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A rocket fires, and you can see that's what Iskander used to do on Kiev.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "Oh, no, these planes fly, they turn on the border."
But we from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
We were then boarded by a bus and taken to Chenky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Look, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are captured.
Poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
Whatever he says, he will be."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The Sanatorium Administration told us, "You're traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called) were spreading misinformation that men in Poland could not travel.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents, the daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate, nothing was helped, and in Minsk the station said that no one would take anyone on a bus without passports.
Here I'm going to say that the Belarusian volunteers were very helpful.
We were housed in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
To our second group, the migration representative said you could live here for a week or so, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an inside carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we drove past Mozir (about 50 km from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw ballistic missiles launched in Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozira said that the Russians were constantly shooting at the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was summoned.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They don't realize that their ranges are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland we had friends who had taken us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now probably as much as Estonian."
Marina lived in a military town in Hostomela with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22.
In the morning of February 24th, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the necessary items and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself couldn't go home and, in principle, she can't, she doesn't have a house anymore.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go somewhere in the center on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we're always waiting for you.
Thank you for the arrangement, the butterflies are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, he doesn't get to pick up the wifi, basically I'm answering all your questions, and now I don't know how to be?

The Koran says: “Even the leaves of the tree fall from its familiar place. ”
The kids are learning online, and by profession, the seller and the cook, but I can work both in the field and the cleaning lady, which means the mary specialist can work at home, and the second Mariana doesn't have any specialty, so it's different.
Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1st, the city head Butchi Anatoly Fedoruk gave a happy message - the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31st.
The next day, the invaders were expelled from the whole of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at that time was obscured by horror and hatred, as it was known that in one of the Butchis alone, the Russians had shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed on the street, handcuffed and shot in the back of the head, and some of the murdered are minors.
The men killed and followed by torture were found by the mayor of the village of Motyjin Olga Suhenko, her husband, Igor, and Alexander’s son, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in a fraternal grave, Igora in a sewer.
On the other side of the road 20 miles [20 km] from Kiev, the bodies of several naked women were found wrapped in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, no one will be home.
I ordered a shipment from Germany using DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it to me yesterday, but no one contacted me, and the shipment wasn't delivered, and the DHL site said the recipient couldn't be found.
So the mail was sent and the address of the branch office was given.
How can I take her?
When I was little every day a few times I could be on the river, a river right next to the house is very close, but now I'm very rarely walking, there's no time, and sometimes I just want to go with my sister.

I talk to you very often, and I think you hear my thoughts.
President Vladimir Zelensky stated that certain weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said that in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, he wrote "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some equipment it's too late.
So what if, for example, we're talking about Mariupol, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
On the question of, that's enough weapons for Ukraine to make a difference in war, the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, it would not have been, or it would have had a different look.
"It would otherwise have unfolded, we would have had the shoulders of our immediate neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there would still be no war," he added.
To remind you, the prime minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoury and anti-shipry weapons.

The pea's already gone to the nursery but not so simple... it's crying very hard.
A new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden today
I didn't even touch the door, and she's ringing.
If I understood the director correctly, he said that if I worked in the garden, I could come to work some days for as many hours as I received.
If that is the case, then I will be able, for example, to go to work several days a week for a few hours.
Exactly how many hours and what days I'm going to watch myself go out to fashion and clean apartments, there's more to be paid for cleaning, so I don't want to give up that job.
I'm a water-supply tech so the taste of water feels immediate.
She said cheap and delicious cakes

Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a lady from DameIedlo and she said they were dropping information on my e-mail about what was going on, and I never answered.
She spoke Czech and that's how I understood her.

He was a very wealthy man, but he liked me because I had a point of view of life I met him, then I walked away from him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he called and told him that he had a heart surgery.
He asked me simply to communicate with him and to support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it was letting go of my chest.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were, like, 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
What about the apartment you dropped the photo?
I haven't really got there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already rectified this fairy tale.
The last two videos I'm going to see when the Internet is going to work.
Is there a dress code at work or not, or is it possible to walk in what there is?
All right, he'll come over there and take them.
I don't want anything.
I understand that I can't sit with you. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1, and we don't need Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man the police and the ambulance came by?
Diane didn't answer to me, either.
Okay, all I have to do is print out the pictures for the kids, so it'll be good.
But you may need to learn more about the Czech language.
I live to make sure you're happy with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, in tourism.
You really don't want to come with the kids for a minute, calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In general, it is hard to smoke in a foreign country, and every day more and more people want to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make the best of our lives here.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.
And I'm going to remember and I'm going to smile, and I'm going to remember
Thank you so much, Annie, for setting up the geolocation route on the phone so we can get there sooner.
I have to pay the fare, I have to control it.
How can I see how much I'm using?
How am I supposed to pay?
"I tell her that the TV and radio repairs have been delayed because of the import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to make too much noise when they're on the phone."
"We hide information about war from the mother-in-law for a month.
So far it's working.
However, Spots (cat-UP) on the snail and the hind paws licked the fur – it can be from stress, change in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been removed, and, unfortunately, the stress does not depend on me.
The stain, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Thanks to Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her bride-in-law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
There was a war hidden from her, and what I was doing next was formally coming here for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver -- she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The receiver was always at the bedside.
Most of the mother - in - law spends most of his time in his room.
She's not feeling well. It allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I was hiding in my room.
First, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who was talking to her, six or seven people.
I asked her to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end.
It's April 17th that I have a cleaning of 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I didn't think about it once :)
Hey, if we need any more help tomorrow, we can come.
Is it necessary to order lunch from the house?These documents need to be printed or are they printed there and I will sign them?
I'd like to propose a man's haircut, a woman's, a child's visit to you, all of whom are invited to write in a personal message, price:
I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation, I'll be looking here.
I'm telling you the embassies are only here,
A British man who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the U.S.S.A. says he's ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British member of the Marine Corps of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defence of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would assemble arms and surrender to Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter site of Aiden Aislin, a British man who has served in the ranks of the U.S.S.U. since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of the family and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend named Aislin, who spoke to him
We got a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Marioupolis, but we have no choice but to capture the Russian troops.
We have no food and ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Marine Corps, which is involved in the Marie Paul defense operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of a military officer, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last telephone conversation, Eislin had said about the plans of their capitulation unit.
He said that the brigade had run out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted a friend of his who said that Eislin's unit was going to be captured by Russian troops so that they wouldn't get into the arms and bullets at the hands of a group of so-called cadres.
Also on social media were audio recordings of a phone call that says that Eislin is talking to a friend of his who is planning to go to Ukraine.
As she spoke, they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
A British man used to say that Instagram was threatened by representatives of a private military company called Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the U.S.S.S.A. and took an oath.
Ashley’s friends and loved ones called him Johnny, and in social networking he was better known for his nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You offered to go with you, I agreed if everything was okay.
Thank you, until you do, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful.
If you don't want to write me again, I'll wait.
Hello, Natalie, please pour the flowers outside the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech too.
I'd like you to at least rest a little bit and think about yourself.
Today you must apply face cream)
Thank you very much. I didn't even expect to find such a person, health and luck!!!
Is little Duchan not ashamed anymore?
Ondrzej and his father came to our home.
No one else came in, although there were many Christmases on the street.
We're home today.
The kids were teaching lessons, they're playing now.
I have to go to Lidle after lunch to buy some food.
You have me.
You know I love you.
I'll do anything for you.
How can I prove this to my love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove everything to you.
Perhaps you have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy
Grandmother can't, she's got a lot of pain in her legs and across her.
How much is it in Prague to rent a two-bedroom apartment?
Will all parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
I have three brothers and a husband left.
One brother for the wars in Mariupol, the other in Zaporozhye, and the man today from Kiev was transferred to Harkov.
They're on the phone every day saying it's okay, and who knows it, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but she wanted to take care of some things.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll make it tomorrow.
When you get home, write to me, please, and I would like to speak to Daniel.
The Bolsheviks for their losses in battle played out in full.
He was shot by a teacher named Dmitr Pavlitz, his unknown relative, a young man named Boris Aleksienek.
Their bodies were hurled into “the deepwashed pit that was buried in the ground. ”
“ There was some sort of dead silence in the city, ” he recalls.
Rarely, one of the residents ran from house to house.
In the streets, the bodies were always rolled up by the Bolsheviks.
I can't do it without you.
3. What is your own activity/activity that would help you and your friends to adapt better to life in the Czech Republic?
But you're not going to make it, because there's a reconstruction of the railroad and there's a roadblock.
You'll get to the bridge where the reconstruction is, you'll tell me we're here and I'll come to you.
The Best Future for Us
Lena things that didn't fit our size, give them to you, or you can give them to Katie.
Yes, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
I'm just waking up early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep four or five hours while I'm asleep.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when they came)))) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understand correctly, they'll send us a letter of entry from school to speak to the menu.
Well, we'll try to get us to social services on Tuesday.
Then, when the sauce is cooled and the dough is fine, the cakes are fine and they are hot in a small fire in the oil.
Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we set up tomorrow night, I'll pick it up and pick it up Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because it was the last hope, really.
I’m not afraid of work, as I was living in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When Things Can Be Brought to You
You have a very interesting tradition, we go this way on Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council adopted Bill 7176, which is called "The Monitoring of Potential Threats to Ukrainian National Security in the Field of Economics".
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the area of economics has been found... the place where the members of the board of directors of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The project's initiators believe that the decision-making of the board of directors of the state of Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine's national security problems.
We know a lot of new dangers for the state-owned companies, but so far we don't know about any company that needs to physically hold a board meeting at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understood as a great basis for "to bear" all acquisitions in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then to establish manual management.
This is what it was until 2015.
Why should the state companies have oversight councils, and who should be involved?
What's more, if one harmful bill "flies" under patriotic slogans, another can fly tomorrow, for example, through ProZorro or the independence of the NBA.
There's a lot to write down for war.
By the way, this initiative came before the beginning of the war and the Bill of Law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was introduced into the comparative table of bill 5397.
In general, the desire to launch oversight councils in one way or another has been circulating among some national defenders for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to illustrate the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we'll make our own proposals on how to deal with the management of businesses during the war.
The first deputy minister of the economy, Dennis Coudin, explained the need for such innovations to risk the loss of the Internet and other means of communication that would make it impossible for the oversight boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the board of supervisors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is, but can it prevent him from moving members of the oversight councils to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which make up most of the staff) place their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, the bill will allow them to be released.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum, which is necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it is impossible to quickly appoint new independent members of the board of supervisors, since the law foresees the need for an average of 3-4 months of competitive selection.
Thus, the 7176 decisions proposed by law are likely not to save the supervisory board’s ability to make decisions, but rather to do so!
People's MP, author of Dmitry Nataluh's bill, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes that "many businesses, such as the defence and industrial complex (OPC), are now in need of relocation" and therefore "hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are hardly any OPC holdings that have oversight councils.
The Supervisory Board is except for the Ucro-Bronprom, which essentially manages almost all OPC's holdings.
But even in the "Ukrabonprom," according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has a fairly limited mandate, and all its members are doing their duty on a non-free basis.
All the power in the "Ukrabonrom" belongs to the Director-General, who will, by the way, decide on the need for the relocation of a company of the OPC that is part of the company.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand up to criticism because bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of the OPCO companies at all.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmitry also cites arguments that can be referred to as "emotional."
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the work of state-owned companies and statesmen, but let's try to understand some of them: "important foreign experts in the first word 'war' leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory councils in state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself actually suffers from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of those board members have never lived in Ukraine and have only come here periodically.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, softly speaking, unjustly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long used online meetings.
It is a tool that has long been widely practiced in the world, in a wide variety of fields: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
Don't forget, too, that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
Usually, people like that have different jobs, and it's the electronics that help them do that.
Thirdly, all of these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitry not make identical claims to members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not at their company's location either.
To put it this way, it's not the first populist attempt by the MPs to remove foreigners from oversight councils, and war is just a new opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, looking for options for temporary family shelter, with me two children.

My soul is filled with quiet joy, and I look at Joza and see her happiness, the certainty of her steps.

This week, I could have come Wednesday, and the next week, I guess I could have done it on Thursday.
Yes, I understand what needs to be done.
I'd also appreciate it if you'd let me know from the beginning that I'm doing everything the way you want me to do it.
We usually need one of the adults' passports.
In Brovarsky, Vysgorodski, and Buchansk regions of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the invaders, they will establish a two - day reinforced curfew.
Pavluka's direct language: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vysgorodski and Buchani regions under Russian occupation and freed by the Ukrainian defence forces, the curfew is increased!
On the territory of these cities and the village restrictions will operate from 21:00 p.m. on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5th."
Details: According to the head of the cloud, it is absolutely forbidden to travel on the streets and in other public places by transport and by foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during a distress signal in order to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the effects of Russian aggression – to clean up and exchange territories.
The omelyanuk urged the people who had left the areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kiev, the curfew will be daily from 9:00 to 6:00.
I haven't been sent anything from school yet. I've just got a payment bill.

I came back early Monday, and the alarm worked.
I need to go to the apartment, move in, find an apartment, and there's no furniture, no refrigerator, no washing machine....
Why did you forbid it?
It's not appropriate, it's going to be very expensive, it's going to be expensive, it's going to be very expensive, it's going to take a long time to get to the road.

Just below, I added an explanation of what an incaso is.
I've already got an account, I've done it at another bank, because I had to have an account for it.
Serbia’s defence budget has grown in geometric progress for several years.
In all, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros over the past six years in the modernization of the army, the upgrade of military technology, and the acquisition of modern systems, raising 22 seats on the list of the world’s most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the RF against Ukraine, the Western countries took the prospect of possible exacerbation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complex and globalized.
If you don't mind, I'd come.

The Lukashenko regime has detained three Belaruss for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay lockers of a signal system under Osipovici, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Liberty, Spring Law Center, Head of the Criminal Police, Gennady Kazakevic, quoted by the Belta State Information Agency
In the BBC, Belarus reported that three Bobruisk residents were detained on the night of March 30, with the strong support of the SOBR special forces, and one was injured.
According to News, the men in custody were actively resisting and trying to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with medical care locally.
Head of Criminal Police of the Ministry of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevitch, said that "the acts of terrorism on RB railways will be strictly stopped" by force using weapons.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another member of the Belarusian railway, a co-worker of the Baranovic Department of BZD and the administrator of BZD's thematic resources at W Kontactie and Odnoklasnik Valentin Samasuk.
Where he is now and in what state he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railways had been held behind diversions in Belarus.
To remind you, the formation of BYPOL, declared by Lukashenko's regime of extremes, continues to call on Belarusrs to create diversions on the railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Victory Plan.
The Belarusian partisans are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, because of Belarus, the RF is shifting live power and technology into Ukraine to fight.
It's for self-esteem.

Even a separate law was passed on this issue
We've been here for four days, so it's just a horror, not a road.
They drove through the region of Kiev, the city of Irpin, and then there were horrors, shootings, sirens.
I'm worried about them, too.

US bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against President Putin's daughters, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sbyerbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
That's what the White House report says.
Sbyerbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is Russia's largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets pertaining to the US financial system and prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will implement a total ban on new investments in the RF.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
Private sector output includes producers, energy companies, large retail traders, financial institutions and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," the White House statement said.
The third step of the new U.S. sanctions was the restrictions on large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will ban U.S. citizens from doing operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the United States.
Myfine's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin, wife and daughter of Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustini
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

We lived wonderfully, and we did not even think that we would have to flee because we no longer have the strength to bury ourselves in the funeral.
I was lucky, and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will give us shelter at first.) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if that's in our pocket.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We have no harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
After lunch, I had one English lecture, and after that, I went to work in the nursery.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does it well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and she were talking about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an ad from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira won't answer the phone, I don't know if she got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investment and stop supply.
But we didn't get it.
There were no soldiers in our house.
Our home is near the military and oil base
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I cook well, I don't ask too much, and I give you good advice.
I'm doing fine.
It's kind of hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this phase.
We'll meet you Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
It's all good.
How often do you clean up?
I clean every week.
I'm afraid I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard about the housing information, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you can find one, let me know.
For my part, I'm not gonna let you down.
Thank you very much.
I haven't written you another man for 54 years. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think you'd better make copies of our passports, they've got all the information.
I haven't changed my last name since I was born:)
I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'll do it now and send it to you right away.
We're going to the med committee right now.
I mean, we don't have to work this hour out on another day.
Which day would she better come early? (Maybe on what day a little more work?)
Tomorrow I'll listen, the Internet's not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you. I found something from the stuff, but the tech didn't...
Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, we don't know anything.
Nothing's happening.
How about Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken with you, the toy here is enough:)
I guessed about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll come up with something with this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as this will be paid, please, no credits.
Write it straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do you have to take the clothes with you?
It's not my day. The pits in the living room are broken.
Something came from you. I don't see that.
I'm also very sad.
Let me remind you of the invoice later.
You're the only one who talks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do the cleaning of the house, and how many houses does the house have?
I'm ashamed to keep you out of your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
I advise you to read Joe Dispens, he's doing research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalia Nagorna released a video in the morning of April 12, which was handed to her by the 36th Marine Corps in Mariupol.
It says that they had no weapons left to engage in battle and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "The bill's on the clock."
Previously, on April 11, 36, a separate Marine Brigade, which is involved in the defence of Mariupol, published a statement to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11th could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military commanders were not associated with the fighters for two weeks.
Socrates expressed skepticism that the application was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valérie Zalužný, assured that the link between command and defence forces in Mariupol was and that the details of the defence operation should not be subject to public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Austall factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped an unknown substance on Mariupol.
According to Azova leader Andri Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Austall plant, which is being held by the Azov regiment fighters.
Thank you, I'll adjust under you.
It's the same situation as we're staying here.
2 hours drive )) walk, mom by the shops and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Czech drone squadron has now begun its flight over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional hooves will be used to detect, and some of them will be used to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zacarpathian and two Czech bird brothers were sent to Ukraine the other day thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevsk region of Volodymira Labutenk.
Today, their intermountain friends led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/Vasil Sztur delivered drones at their destination: they received special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
With a view to making the most of the efficient and safe use of the hoofers, their location will be kept secret at the moment.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic stop at what they have done are not planning to stop, saying that as soon as possible, many more interesting gifts will be sent to Ukraine to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I like sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'll be back in Ukraine soon, keep working.
Okay, if it's gonna be okay, I'll agree.
I'll do it myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you, if you don't mind?
It's important that we understand each other
We were personally in the old lady's village in Yev, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said there was no place to live.
Maybe she'll be happy and get in the mood.
I got my phone fixed today.
And I think I'm freezing out on the street today.
I've had my medicine and my tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, throw me the music you like.
I'm curious how you've got your music skills.
Mom and Dad need to obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's chariot.
It was colder and rainier here today, and tomorrow it's supposed to be warm.
But it is not a pity that the houses are destroyed, that the people who are being bullied by the invaders are harmed.
In Herson, the invaders made fun of the "Glory of Ukraine" Memorial in Herson on Perkopska Street.
Details: It is reported that unknowns have ripped off the flag of the European Union, smashed the panels with photographs of the Heavenly hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders ripped off portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly hundreds and of the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They've lifted the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for Christmas Eve, we don't have that kind of habit so we didn't know they gave the kids just chocolate and cookies, maybe there was something else we needed to give them.
There's someone in Czech to talk to if you want.
Because I live in a groupie until twelve people are here, and then they go to work.
Hey, that's a little better.
I was already in the nursery today.
He slept there even today.
That's why we're making great progress.
I'll definitely bring the boileds some other time!
I don't have the strength to make them.
Since I am pushed away from the days and times when there is a job cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April of the month because I already have an estimated cleaning schedule.
For May, I can say about the end of April or early in May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write off dinner for a while and got some sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or I'll meet you after you arrive)
He's been modest, he's been learning a lot lately, and he's realized that he really needs it in his life.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today, there is a lesson from the lady who is the director of the department of economics of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The nipple in the nursery behaved well.
On Monday, I have to bring a receipt for employment and cash payment for a day’s wage.
I've been moaning since Friday.
I don't just do a lot of things to them and I sleep a lot (and I drink a lot of water)
If she's going to see a doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
I need to get another analysis.
You won't have to drive again.
It's a very bad water tank, it's a bad wash, it needs a master, it needs a fix.
That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language class you signed up for.
And children are fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment, there's one question.
If you need more help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover today, aren't you?
We didn't really want you to raise money from the start, so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough two points:
I'm going to go to bed, get my strength and energy, and thank you for tonight's gift.
This is going to be a good idea, because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazin urges workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Use only official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
I've got some work to do for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they're supposed to be on the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I get the day that I'm not at work is a pass?
Headquarters Summary: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can use provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Russian Federation's armed forces carry out provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobodan direction.
Likely, in the near future, the invaders will try to restore the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and dispatch special forces, weapons, and equipment to engage in hostilities in Ukraine.
Armed and military equipment are being trained at the location of the 60th single motorcycle brigade (Monastration) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to recover the personal loss of the battalion tactical unit from the 36th separate motorcycle brigade (Borzia, Zabaykal Region) 29 general military armies of the Eastern Military District are being recruited from the designated brigade.
The enemy feels a particular problem when it comes to completing driving positions and driving mechanics.
The selection of the individual from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Perhaps the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the battle stations, will continue to strike on transport infrastructure objects in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying them or disposing of them.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian and Belarusian borders in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobožan direction, separate units of the 6th general army and the coast forces of the northern fleet continue to block the city of Harkov, and artillery fires continue in separate areas of the city.
In the Izumi direction, there is an aerial reconnaissance of the area to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
To do that, the opponent uses the Orlan 10 BPLA.
With the forces of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack the population of the Long and Dmitrovka sites, without success or departure.
In the Donetsk direction, the opponent continues to focus on the areas of Poznań, Rubie, Lower, and Novobahmutovka under control, as well as the establishment of full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out storm activities in the Golden region, and he had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, by means of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue to storm in the areas of the Austal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual divisions, the enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the populated sites of Visopil, Trudolovka and Mariansk.
In the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk, four enemy attacks, five tanks, eight armoured units, six vehicles, and eight enemy artillery systems were destroyed by Ukrainian defenders in the past.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We usually try to catch up, but I doubt it.
How could you want to sleep and I'm holding you up?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't even watch TV at home and more than 1+1.
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to the Czech language
I'm running out of tariffs today for the month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy embroidery cloth, rope, thread for embroidery
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us pies anyway.
We'll meet my father later, I'm sure.
I read the Facebook ad, so I think Google wrote something in his own way.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but are there things on us that little can bring you in 10 minutes?
I've been thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director is in charge, I can start going to work next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the work office to file documents (if possible, because very large queues) and Saturday rain :)
I'm looking for the brigade in the beginning, I've really liked chemistry in school, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly well, I'm dreaming of working at Tewa.
Friends are old and not very old, friends I don’t know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Hard times have come to you too.
During the last month, I spoke to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why they're surrendering to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have prepared for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexander Cerkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
Let me talk to you a little bit later, as usual, Sasha responded in a very concise way.
Others — cultural actors, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Gazette, in Echo Moscow, in Medusa, in the Naval organization, and in a number of other places -- did many of you do anything at all to oppose this regime?
Except that they participated in the rally when it was still happening.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Last to Hide, Late to Silence"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which are now likely to weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- messy even bloody but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you finally have such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king's back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer with him.
Yes, mistakes were made.
Instead of taking over and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did in the Stairs, you took your soul to the Cerginsky monument -- and let the KGB lie down, update, transform, and take control of the country.
When you were faced with a choice between robbing the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for a third option -- and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, which marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Then Putin showed up, young, receptive, aggressive, he promised to get rid of the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed their eyes.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of the roadside "anti-terrorist operation," and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, to kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, caused by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have made good money, some have made a fortune, and even the poorest of you have bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices went up, but what's the problem?
Moscow was festively shining and shivering from the pole.
When several opposition leaders were killed – Yuri Szczkochihin, Anna Politkovsky, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and terrified about what was happening.
However, the matter was far from over.
When Putin transferred the post of President to Medvedev after two terms, and himself took the prime minister's seat, you barely paid attention to it.
When the Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after several months of rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the coming years on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the suburbs of Kazbeg or in the cafe and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while some of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, we hardly did much in the West if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s violent violation of international law when such a great temptation to Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, had woken up.
When Putin once again swapped seats with Medvedev and planted the Presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you mass protested.
The name of the Navalna has become callous, you haven't walked off the streets in six months, and the regime has finally felt with horror that it's losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
Alternative actions were first organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some were given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I can still hear it.
"The country is so strong and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry by the pro-Russian president who cheated on their European hopes, they once captured Maidan -- and never left him again.
They built their own tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defenses.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors turned into an attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Janukovic, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders, and to expel them if they do their job wrong.
The course was very displeasing to Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took over Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits were limited.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his teacup suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it difficult to find a reason because right after that, we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were largely silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were the new one hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, and it's like new after the restoration that Moscow mayor started in 2012, with their binbags, the public bath and the hipster cafe.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
Idea or whatever... even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria then criticized her in an interview because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I've been going there and I've seen government snipers shoot my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Of all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers were there, and in 2015 thousands of civilians were bombed, gaining experience in the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the Socialists, but I kept quiet -- because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the unions, but I kept my mouth shut because I'm not a member of the unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept quiet - because I am not Jewish.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority kept silent.
Some actually speak now, such as Dmitri Gluchowski, Mikhailo Šishkin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Oseninikov, at risk of entering a new gulag or forming a Naval company.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians -- or what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously but mostly went out on their own to protest and have yet to hold a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreements in social networking (even in black squares in Instagram), or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote have not remained in the distant past -- and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians -- even more than 2014 -- frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be combated.
And that intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage is on paper.
In view of all of this, few in Russia realize this as well as what is going on in the war.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You're reading foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you're connected.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what's going on.
A fine life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your election is just a hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is gone, your economy is going down faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try and leave or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other options.
Still, there is one more.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe under the conditions that have arisen, it'll take less of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark doesn't come from you: because of the economic collapse that's taking place in Russia, it's likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace would come out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which is you, my friends.
But if each city goes to a rally in itself, as it has done periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
We're going to need organization and coordination, and we're going to have to turn the crowd into mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet, which can limit the regime, but which is still working and that can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
The Naval organization has been devastated, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.
There are so many of you, there are millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300,000 come out, she'll be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared if I were you.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom but to seek it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will drop the joke in the chat room of the computer game, and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet, and she will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and die in a Syrian cell under police clubs.
That's what's been going on for years -- it's going to keep getting stronger and bigger and bigger.
So you have no choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to be like.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it real.
We were in class Friday, we were told we could come Monday.
We'll be home by nightfall
That you think of me as a press secretary
How often do you go to a fancy restaurant?
I'm having dinner at a fancy restaurant once in a while.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something brighter so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of work.
We already did, but they said who registered in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday. We're going with the kids to the doctor.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm expecting new news from her, and I'll be sure to let her know.
When I was working at the D.A., I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a shame to waste your time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but I take marriage seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I think that in order to make a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
For now, I've never met one of these.
Good afternoon, where can you get a form for baking your belt (paper or silicone) in Jihlava?
Okay, thanks for the advice, then I'll put a witness on Vala.
She's got a D.P.P. in her lying position, now her leg's broken in the cast, her wheelchair's in the lying position, and the food's all over the blender.
Mr. Rayhard, I'm sorry to bother you at a bad time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the kids went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to look at the things and put them in that room with the clothes on, and Mr. Valérie opened our nursery to her yesterday until 7:00.
Is that really the case?
It's room time until 4:00.
Finally, it is our responsibility.
But I don't have loads that don't open a very weak web page
Good afternoon, we're doing fine.) When she was working, the snacks were filled out yesterday, and I took care of the seniors before the high school exam.
It's the hardest thing to do while you're working on geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
The age is studied by universities and higher - school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the accommodations
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill it out.
We'll try to get the sum by the end of the week to figure it out.
The situation regarding the Russian invasion is the briefing of President Alexi Arestovic, adviser to the Office (10.04.2022)
The president's advisor to the president's office told of the heroic action of a senior army officer in Mariupol -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that she wouldn't get to the enemy.
I have a very important question about whether they're going to help me put my granddaughter in charge of my 5-year-old (bronchial asthma) right now, she's got a frown and a wheeze...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice on the matter is of great concern to us.
We live in the Czech Republic of Lower Chabri. we need a doctor who's about here in Lower Chabri or somewhere near maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was a delight.
The butterflies sat on the children’s hands and feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, what a cool little garden! I'm so grateful, no words, thank you so much.
