Inflation in Europe leapt because of food
The increasing inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
The November price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October the annual inflation rate was 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic interest rate by reducing, together with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment, the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "do away" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about this later on.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The euro area inflation has shrivel up due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The term prices of wheat have risen by 88 percent, and soybeans have also reached the highest levels since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will decline to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain at approximately 3% over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to immediately reduce interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesh movement's circle of supporters has grown significantly by the beginning of December, and so now it has the largest camp since 2002, whereas in the case of socialists, the Gallup Institute has never found so low - 13% support so far.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of the support compared to the five-thirds support of the IFRS.
According to a survey under the threshold for entry into parliament, the MDF and the SZDSZ are: their support across the entire population is two percent.
Among certain party voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even with the previous minimum - there has never been a ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while according to the next 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
Families appreciate the change in their material situation after spring and summer more promising prospects now more pessimistic.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those questioned were judged, most of which is the previous Gallup Institute survey that the prime minister is doing his job more badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or believes 13 percent of those questioned, while Victor Orbán has 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent, President of the Fidesh movement 27 percent.
One indicator of political developments is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While the government and the prime minister considered the government to be the desired 35 percent after last October’s riots, this proportion is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) only seeing solutions in the drafting of the new elections.
For the sake of the referendum, it is clear that 60 percent of the respondents replied to a question concerning their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly have taken place and another 20 percent said that it would probably have occurred.
By comparison, only 55 per cent of the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would definitely be attended and another 15 per cent would consider their participation probable.
The school would have been told not 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people promising their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital charges would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive one is Auchan, almost a fifth of what Tesco did.
Last year's hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained an average of 16% price growth, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of the Napi Gazdaság Diary
The usual Christmas basket of the Napi Gazdaság daily in the Budaörs trade triangle grew on average by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of over 1,000 forints in the price.
Since the prices in food supermarkets "were up" in December last year, there was no such drastic aversion in view of the earlier high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price of less than 9,000 forints will not be worth 10,000 now.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they greatly irritated cruel breasts, nuts and poppy as well.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilo of bread even for 139 forints in Auchan.
The competition did not go below 200 forints with the price of the product.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-litre Coca coly in a bottle was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints.
However, this year he appeared to be the most expensive in the Napi Gazdaság Auchan daily, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, she raised prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket due to last year's Christmas prices Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent.
Compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forints there was an increase of 1,480 on average.
The average increase in prices last year came to 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It is this process that has reversed trade, that commercial houses have obviously not been able to decide how large price ranges are to be determined for individual products, since they have not been able to predict the impact of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product concerned wrongly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price margin adjusted to the volume of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the price of the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság was so extreme last year that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest one made the price difference of 844 forints everywhere.
This year's extreme difference has not been made, the most expensive basket has now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one of 1,284 forints.
In comparison with both Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic rise in prices, and in less than 20 months, the goods of daily consumption in hypermarkets were taxed by more than 30 percent.
(In particular, this does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured in the case of several basic foods an increase in prices exceeding 30 % over 12 months.
Except flour, for example, even in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the daily economy, it seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed, given the basis and worst case scenario, the price growth of only over 10 %.
The flour suppliers are more likely to take a stronger position than egg suppliers, a drastic increase in prices in international chains as well.
Hypermarkets in the gold triangle don't complain, they still report a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything, they buy the quantity, they take the permanent food on wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the checkouts, as the number of visitors increased rapidly.
However, as we know, in the countryside there is a lower turnover, many international chains complain to research firms that the sales are behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were registered in hospitals due mainly to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, bed overcrowding, staff overloading the disease stop, says the Prime Minister of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, a MRSA infection was diagnosed in St. John's Hospital's trauma department.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria present in his body, one important operation could not have been performed.
Until 10 December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease were reported in the National System of Nesocomialis Survey, according to Karolina Böröczová, the head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by the multi-resistant causes of diseases have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are unknown.
Almost two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacyline resistant to gold staph.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. carotid inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, if the antibiotics are administered to an excessive extent or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that responds well to the antibiotics of bacteria, which are very resistant to antibiotics and which spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transient or permanent ill-functioning of the immune system in patients with reduced body weight, low body weight or in patients aged may cause serious hospital infections such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to St. John's chief physician, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, a similar infection in hospitals for daily practice.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of the disease is not investigated."
Resisting Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treatment staff treats them in rubber gloves and masks and we need antibiotics to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but this is not always the way to avoid infection.
Sampling is out of fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not conducive to the prevention and spread of multi-resistant origins of diseases, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should be monitored and MRSA carriers isolated immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is out of fashion.
The role of the National Health Insurance Fund in this is that these examinations are not financed.
Most of the cases are so exposed if the patient suffers from a detectable MRSA infection, said the primary epidemiological centre.
For appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, the European Union has strict recommendations and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, however, even hospitals do not comply in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the basic, as far as outpatient care is concerned, says Karolina Böröczová.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads to patients most frequently through medical personnel.
That is why it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are serious deficiencies in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transmitted by cappnoccal infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, rooms are often overcrowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also see that in hospitals in an unfavourable material situation they are saving on disinfectants, caregivers are few, and patients are much more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections can be shown to be less or further spreads of the originator of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it fights everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a programme to prevent MRSA, namely to reduce its occurrence.
The programme seems to be successful, according to published data, the MRSA infection in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant disease agents (including MRSA), as well as the number of hospital infections caused by these diseases, among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of police captain XXII of the district that caused the fatal accident is over.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who executed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has in the meantime resigned from his post, would drive under the influence of alcohol or narcotic substances, informed the spokesman of the Supreme State Agency of the capital of Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of the case had been completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the 21st District Police Directorate struck down on Tuesday at Lajose Kossutha Street in XXII. a circuit of his own personal car while turning a five-fifty-year-old man who had entered before him when crossing a car outside the marked crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker crossed outside of the zebra, however, according to the traffic rules is not an extenuating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being taken to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the district police director stepped down and asked for a transfer to service, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
In the matter, he is conducting an investigation by the Budapest State Investigation Agency.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with state agents in the investigation since the beginning.
Another 400m euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400m to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, was signed by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the parties having already concluded a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, which is now signed on the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A 150m-euro loan agreement also serves to finance education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which the budget will mainly use for the research and development project of the University of Debrecin.
At the meeting there was also talk of the 4th subway route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed on the details of the financing of the subway with the EU, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
This can happen in the first quarter of 2008, according to János Verese.
The EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of the whole of Europe is drawn to a somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys at the most cheap yet cheap, but fast-tracking EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European objective of real estate purchases is now no doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountains are the most in the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also searching for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria will sooner or later raise the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and increasingly buys more and more interested people in the vicinity of the cheap town of Ruse.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of attractive opportunities, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is best placed to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, thus becoming next to the summer and winter seasons the desired goal of travel in the next two seasons.
Predictable investors are already buying in large ones, such as in the vicinity of Bansk.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also customers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, there are traditionally many Russian customers at the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
The foreign buyer can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The established people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 000 euros, or expensive old houses for 5-15 000 euros, which then renovate.
They require good availability and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria was among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The auctioning of properties in the capital is continuous, as demand is increasing.
Although the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have grown by 21% annually over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management, the meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday and the international conference on the post-2012 climate regime will continue with the ministerial meetings.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are talking about a Bali Roadmap that addresses efforts following the reduction period set out in the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated violently between developing and advanced countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to deal with the exact figures now, although they are applying to the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 in the light of the situation in 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will join, in addition to reducing emissions, the provision of both material and technological assistance to countries that are benefiting from it.
The Agreement was also born on subsidies to developing countries.
The subsidy fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6 per cent
The Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to up to 30 per cent reduction if other advanced areas of the world, and the countries that have been developed, are willing to accept the responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves at 5.2 per cent for the reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfil. - recalls the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a lot in Bali, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would have moved with certainty until 2012. In this case, the commitments made by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be subject to a new emission reduction system, the need of which, in its latest report, has also been highlighted by the UN international scientific council on climate change - the IPCC, which is the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would result in a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan on the server, popularizing themselves.
First of all, YouTube has been fond of the British Air Force (RAF): special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
Recordings obtained by a miniature camera attached to the helmet shall be checked by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force troops on the Internet and more than 75,000 people have looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as the "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Planting in Afghanistan
Air force released videos according to their original intent to recruit and according to the Ministry of Defence are also good to familiarize the general public with the actual objective of the presence of the army abroad.
"Promotions published in this form against traditional television recruitment advertisements are hardly worth anything," said BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it must also bear a political message, as it confirms in a special form the validity of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a bit of covert, "official" propaganda films, officers talk the most about losses, but there is no bloody form of fighting.
After all, there have been many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the crackdown, but the British army has not come to them until now.
The Americans carry out the recruitment slightly differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffle and parrots
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is not likely to be sentimental: she will host a final working meeting for her coworkers, where she will say goodbye to the parrots and coffee with the year 2007.
At some ministries there will be a live music celebration, where they will delight officials of the Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, concerts and the Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year's most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not expected by its employees.
Children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts at Christmas Orphans, and family members of soldiers serving on foreign missions will visit the Mission Christmas, but they will also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort focuses on the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the bucket against other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry, about three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will follow Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will be various performances and raffles will also be drawn.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the program.
A million forints cost rent, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one department of NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: the company that provides tendering, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vigszínház theatre building.
The MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
There's no need for a suit.
The OIT building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucie's Ball instead of Christmas on December 7th.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with the Minister's toast, and after dinner it was possible to dance with a live music companion.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo], there were no mandatory evening dresses or suits at the dance.
The Puritan party prepares health care, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth's associates are not even officially invited to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to a press release, only get coffee and parrots, so only 350,000 forints will be available for the party.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply toast to his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting at which 436 workers are expected in their own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated to 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes reception with Swedish tables and toast.
Since Minister János Veres, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality strengthens not only the ministerial speech but also the afternoon of the event.
The Department of Agriculture organizes the New Year's reception on 20 January, the Minister's Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyaadvar in the City Gardens and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are reserved for 100 guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief toast to the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal has been reported by the relevant press department.
The price of Christmas celebrations of the environment department in the press department could not be reported.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Art.
He's leaning towards a giant strike.
The League's Association of Trade Unions, and the National Council of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's timeless strike.
A protest public assembly is held on Saturday, on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as rail transport is almost entirely stopped and staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League, together with the National Labour Council Union, will meet details of a jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee Liga - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's event.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly is held, and since Monday, trade unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement with the government is reached.
This means that no deadline has been set for the termination of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the call for a strike immediately.
However, if the legislation is repealed, the strike committees shall meet and decide on the procedure to be followed.
According to the Parliament's agenda for Monday's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will not be voted on until late evenings, if necessary at night.
Due to Monday's start-up strike, it is possible to count on serious disruptions of transport: work will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, part of Budapest's public transport may stop in the morning and more than half of Callan.
At the same time, it will also take place in many parts of the country to close half the road.
Many unions and civil organisations have joined the call for strike, whose list is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organisations have scheduled the strike for an indefinite period, others have announced temporary stoppages.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZ) had not been able to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays, more and more people were travelling on the railway.
According to previous reports, from the beginning of operation up to 13 hours will be scheduled for BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, four-hour strike will be organised by the Trade Union of Workers in the Liga Energy Industry, to a 2-, respectively, 2-8-hour job stop called for by the Trade Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organizes a two-hour alert strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for reform of health insurance and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from next year.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010 is ensured for early retirement for the relevant labour sectors.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZ), which falls under the Trade Association of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railways, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary's Guard Increases Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarszagért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several respects.
The "risk warning" of the company developed states: in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the biggest political risk is that "I will focus on the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary in the short term on violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such an action - the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political representatives: "public debate on the Roma issue has been left to representatives of public life of radical and extremist political groups who have been able to build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian issue."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, according to the Institute.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard's work, according to the Research Institute, has had a strong impact on domestic and foreign media "to a large extent, the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been gaining more publicity and balance since autumn 2006, is that in Hungary a number of organizations have been formed since the summer of 2007 themselves called "national domestic defences".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while they openly declare - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of natural disasters, attacks on their country, disturbances of order), in addition with a clue to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes: this is all happening in a way that seeks to wrap up various political efforts built on the opposition of society to politics and the parties to civilian clothing.
Therefore, the emphasis on civility and the form of association in the case of these groups does not serve only to avoid legal obstacles to judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk-enhancing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the Research Institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the ultra-rightful Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The background of the Bulgarian Guard is mass Romani unrest, which erupted in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used this BNU to establish a guard with the organization's goal being "national home defence".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been a "Gypsy Terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remains inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative sparked a violent discussion by the Bulgarian public.
As he goes on to say, an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they will create their own guards to mark resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's previous activities show similarity to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will also react to a similar threat by setting up their own home defence, we can be reminded of the risks created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital Institute: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute, quoted by the press office.
As he said, risk analysis is published every year and if he finds out something that could have an impact on risk change, they shall inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not all free
In Hungary, days of leave are precisely laid down by law and it has become a general practice that working days are moving around the holidays, which is expected fewer times next year.
Neither in the European Union nor in America are holidays united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Working days tend to refer to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is free - for the New Year so that people can rest after New Year.
During the year, we have a total of eleven holidays available.
The national holiday is the 15th of March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23rd of October, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of the state, May 1st, November 1st and 2nd we remember the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Easter, Summer and Christmas holidays.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has been a practice to move the work day in case we work just one day before or after a holiday.
The price for extended weekends is, of course, that we stay at the workplace and at school the previous Saturday.
When the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is over, we will work, for many years, by the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and to public service persons.
It does not, however, concern companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their destination, operate on working days.
This year, there will be a change of working order only around Christmases at the end of the year: since December 24th, life in the country will almost stop, as according to experience, most people will be "working" before Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Next year, we'll have a few of our holidays right in the middle, especially at the end of the week, so we'll have less than this year's shifts.
For the first time, the calendar will change around the holidays so that the workers can then stay at home for four days.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The next shift is due on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, there will be a working place on Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, next year will be able to take place completely in the Christmas season, since since December 24th they will have almost everywhere a nonstop holiday even though New Year's Eve is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things that you can piss off your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we'll never receive, innocent lies that we'll almost never even notice: that's all "heat" everyday in the workplace.
The question is, are you going to get used to these minor inconveniences or do you want to wear gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
Is that why you missed the party?
Better yet, he regrets and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says the message has forgotten to pass (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is solved by one apology.
Before embarrassing apologies occur, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare for your colleagues and knowingly try to prevent them.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than stretching out for some writing, office need, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table one of your colleagues your pens that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be right to be mad at you for going after them.
Do not take envelopes or sticky papers out of your office because it may be unpleasant if you run out of them early, and you will need them immediately.
Any rumors about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good way to stop the spreading chatter.
Who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your news (domains) about your colleagues' private life!
When one of them shares his innermost secret with you, do not take advantage of his trust!
Lock up what you've heard, and in his absence, don't discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal for severe headaches you will report your absence because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that they have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Pay attention to your colleagues!
If you know that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, announce that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Diving, hypnotic, telephone
Did you go down to work where you're rudely ripped out by a hygienist colleague?
Did you become a witness to a telephone conversation that would be better off not hearing at all?
Don't interrupt your coworkers by muttering, singing, loud talk (injecting above your head), or kicking, by constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they are not directly involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
You're accusing the other of making mistakes?
If something is not right or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame another for your forgetfulness!
Do not respond to any chaos prevailing in the office and loud colleagues!
Admit if you've made a mistake and someone's paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you can fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Shoes and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not fit in the office!
Don't wear your leisure clothes, even if it allows your profession!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in your usual dress - and if that is what your profession requires, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to comply, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
A special tune will be heard from the radio: the sound of violins to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and the previous tone coloring is added bass, then as a real jewel joins the women’s choir.
On the m2 station is the composition of the Zagar group called Wings of Love.
For a long time, home music has not spoiled us with a quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the jam looks a little different, because you're listening to Zagara's new album.
The discovery of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions originating from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall image, and although it is once again in the fashion of the garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zsager started in the Five Church and he also played in Yonderboi's band until eventually - perhaps because two dummies don't fit in one line - he gave up his own way.
But with his project (Zagar) and music that connects the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film by Ference Török "Sezon").
Its formation, played in the beginnings of smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience after the magazine wan2 included their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important domestic boards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic actors determining the development that could be marketable in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "in the course", although, of course, no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it should: it made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the name itself tries to create a link with the initial flights in Five Churches.
This is a poem from the composition of the old Baláz Zsager band there.
The reference to essential, flying would be on the spot, but next to the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of the time - louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a singer, György Ligeti, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle, introduced himself to the premiere of the Millenaris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which has played from morning to evening popular music, we began to find the reverberating tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers (Underground Divas).
So everything's fine (?).
The portal hvg.hu confessed to Baláz Zsager.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how long does what you play remain, the marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's how it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, good pop music can stem from genuine inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as adopted, regardless of language and state boundaries, also works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s who go to concerts, but also older ones.
Much more so are the changes of light music that are happening around them because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how much of your music listens to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts where the influence already works, but it is only hidden in impossible changes at the moment.
Yet, I have noticed that when one wants to please an audience, he has stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How long are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and builds his career west of us.
B. Zc.: We do not actually go his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes tried to explain.
We're more like team players who rely on the musical presence of another and let her develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid our work being compared to Yonderboie’s compositions, for a few of us separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: The song Wings of Love took the lead in the warm-up station m2 Petőfi.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you knowingly opened yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We weren't planning on writing a hit to sell the board.
There's more to that song.
We thought of it as the final album we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
Hvg.hu: How did you pick the six singers?
Why is it - what was the basic principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to form this congregation of soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodos [Neo], Juci Nemet - was baptized into Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you planned the song, or did the girls turn it into something?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the board came together, we thought there would be something else needed for this composition.
The chord trail was meant to be joined by a singing party.
The other day in the night, I sang him a tune that girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and terribly spontaneously.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course it took diva.
It wouldn't work like that with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together, and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
On purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we didn't want to divide the solo roles is deliberate.
And this song is about forgetting a little about our ego, where who is, where it belongs, and just to let those wings rise, wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born felt like everyone else.
hvg.hu: With which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not even with one, the heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time it didn't work grow, then everything slowly found its place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is still changing by the concert, even by the fact that I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Sam.
A traitorous broker has risked billions out of value
Traitor defraudant.
That is how he identifies his fearsome employee Jerome Kerviela, the French banking giant Societte Generale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank.
Because of him, she came almost five billion euros.
More likely, though, Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to make up for his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market at times.
"He's mentally weaker," sounded from the mouth of his superiors, who sent him to the police.
However, as Kerviel’s statement by the French media, such as Le Monde, shows, he was a man who, at the end of last year, had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his stores.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had difficulties in paying back in the past, would have problems.
But the whole economy was not affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profits rose to EUR 1.6 billion.
"By the time I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
All through the interrogation, he admits he faked the records so he wouldn't find him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd find him?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take that much risk?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Social Society of the General in 2000 just after he had graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he became an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the arrival came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he was betting half a billion euros on the decline in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses said they knew if they knew anything.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to clean it up.
When he came to work Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who has no vacation is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half the total amount that Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be heading for traffic.
Transport is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative business.
Firms should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds.
Twenty-year sentence for the president of Nicaragua confirmed by the court
The appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the former President of the country, Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fraud amounting to $100 million (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 is returned to prison, it is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez will now depend on the prison officials whether they will let Alemán serve his sentence at home or like him in prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly moved government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest to his followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán founded on financing his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without opposition support.
This year he passed with the support of ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford his non-acceptance.
Unlike the intense debate before the vote on distrust of the government, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The House of Deputies has traditionally ignored the law, although most influential, peacefully passed it.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the government's powerful rivalry with the opposition.
This is more medialy grateful, and this is why much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The question of politicians is far more interesting to the public than the strict numbers.
The state budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered three ills that it is not able to solve at once for 2008:
The first is a high proportion of the mandatory, so-called mandate-holder expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalities" of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first disease.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It's public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to taxes, fees and loans from banks, receive additional resources for investments, often without any head, issuing bonds that they unduly owe to their city councillors.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by selling mass shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state in privatisation.
Now they don't have this resource anymore.
If we stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through several years, as has the rest of the world, the growth phase, which is constantly boasting about the Czech Republic.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have done much more reasonably than our republic.
It's a huge disgrace, which falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been completely wasted in recent years.
Even though part of the senseless populist expenditure approved before the elections has been abolished, so unless the retirement and pension reform borders are moved in the near future, then any policy in this country will virtually end and whoever rules it will be a mere government.
With a small stake, it can be said that government politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the extortion of normal expenditure by mandate-holders.
A planned deficit of 70 billion per year for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the past ten years of government had failed to do what they could.
If we do not really want government politicians to become merely officials, then we must be patient and give this to a weak coalition government that realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, calm to prepare other reform laws.
Only those will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
So more than a hundred billion dollars will go to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks are auctioning interest rates for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion into the auction, and another $420 will then be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is after the 11th September attacks, for the first time that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group said in his report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion more losses.
"The central banks must be really afraid of what else can happen when they decide on this procedure," ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks have very difficult access to loans, they will also lend auctions to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with a possible impact on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will contribute to fuelling the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and this is the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of Ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now come to light at the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that environmental debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government representatives and NGOs, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so engaged to them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I sometimes only encounter cartoons of my opinions".
Now, then, interested parties can read his unbreakable attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt that he had enough to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to monitor and evaluate professional discussions, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book indicate that climate change is constantly changing and so its changes are normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists that the effects of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore pose no threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptablely costly.
Moreover, as a person with totalitarian experience, he considers it unacceptable to force unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to replace an old driver’s license that would expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to be issued by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's, there will be hundreds of thousands of drivers on the road without valid authorization.
According to the authorities, they didn't change their I.D., especially those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of driver's licenses, the metropolis authorities are overwhelmed and the interest in the exchange of passports increased this week.
The magistrate works around 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the front.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their driver's license.
The issue of a new ID takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request publication within a shorter period of five days.
In that case, however, the driver will charge five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not have to exchange a licence by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver's license will be at risk of fines from January.
The culprit will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can also solve a crime with an agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine shall be up to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, he could have received a fine from a city councilman and a man who was not going anywhere.
He was allegedly able to pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to the Department of Transportation, Karl Handelka's ten thousand fines don't threaten anyone.
The driver’s license is a document for people to decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil ID that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It shall be carried or sent by registered mail to the competent municipal office.
At the end of the year, they will cease to pay the licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists need to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Handelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konjařík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
It was decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Initially, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organised Crime for 14 and 12 years.
The decision today cannot be appealed, it is possible only to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is waiting for a verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences of over 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found, in particular, 19 people guilty of robbery, the Supreme Court today decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have rejected the case since the beginning of the investigation.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police, by agreement, inter alia, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robbery, and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
Gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Konjařík.
The prosecution is a criminal activity of a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, about robberies, whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also about the abuse of the power of the public official and illicit arms.
The police discovered illegal pistols, shots with steel cores, laser sightings, or rifles during their home tours.
According to the indictment, the gang has come up with tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already declared guilty of other Berdych robberies and a number of others.
Other men in the vicinity of Berdych still testify before the court in another trial, some of whom have not yet traveled before the court.
The main census has so far been avoided by Tomáš Poto and Maroši Šulej, who are in Irish custody, awaiting a definitive decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Child replacement account: 12 million
In exchange for the children in the family, the lawyer of the damaged families of Igor Veleb wants 12 million crowns of damages for the Trebe hospital, plus court expenses.
For each of the mothers for three million, for the father for two million and for the children for a million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of Ondřej Dolán Hospital therefore disagrees with the Veleba proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," he said after today's meeting.
"But in order for us to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has been able to draw up.
Let's find out if it's even worth it.
But we persist in the view that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," pointed out Enough.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiating the damages expert opinion for him, which was produced by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress in various degrees and depths.
Men were better placed to deal with the stress situation, even though they were struggling with regrets that the replacement of newborns was not prevented.
Again, women are worse off from the current trauma, and with what is happening right now, the content of the Web has been summed up.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the trebian maternity home last December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákův to Pribyslavice and Veronica to Libor Brožov and Jaroslav Troyanová to Jablonův.
Haytman Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil handed over at the end of October each of the families 100,000 korunas to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Trzebič hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of doubt, they must reach out to the reserve fund, in particular they may request the assistance of the founder.
To date, courts have granted relatively low compensation to people, sums being calculated according to the tables in the thousands, especially millions of crowns.
The Soup Lost the Valas Kingdom
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute over the brand of the Valas Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Istrian Regional Court, the name was first used by the king of Wallash, but the project built a longtime team around Tomáš Haravis, who worked with the actor.
The soup wasn't in today's meeting.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end, and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabis and his team are parasitic in the popularity of Bolka Polivka," said Polivk's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, everyone in the word of the Valas Kingdom will be able to save actors and comedians.
Harabish has the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years' work to do.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have some of it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lurkative business
According to the court, the Valas king first used Polivka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Bryko richý.
But it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wailash passports.
From the original recession, trade and lucrative business activities were excluded, which Harabiš then established the company of the Valash Kingdom.
In 1997 the soup agreed to mention its name and signature in passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabis had only used the bare idea that Polivka had published in the manoeuvring for his business purpose.
"The popularity of the Boleslav Polyvice project of the Valas Kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to it.
Today, the cooperation of the disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabis organized official coronation in Svetina for Polivka.
Since then, however, disputes between Polivka and Harabis have begun to gather that culminated in the assembly of the "King of Boleslav I. elected for furt".
The leader of the kingdom was then taken to Harabis by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka then filed a lawsuit against Harabis and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, it could bring Harabish a premeditated bow to the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to give up the details and the deadline yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like riding kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polivka can freely sign up," Harabis added.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTI: Vanishing Prejudices
To tell you the truth, I've never been too fond of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the ranking, management and production could also be marked as sub-average.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and it's much better.
And the van called SW goes a little further and I'm not left to think about.
When I tested the classical hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the back seats.
This is the end of the complaint here, because the van's body means that they won't suffer even two meters long in this direction.
The World’s Flight
I'll get through the interior very quickly so I don't have to say it again.
It's a very well-behaved design, where I have the only exit to the poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design innovation here if the car looked so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or seatbacks.
The side line also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is an increase in the dimensions of the body.
Then the lack of space above the head of the van disappears.
Cases in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his trunkman.
This one I have to evaluate as very well accessible (and thanks to the folding back window) and as decently compatible.
Deaf places are equipped with condoms, which are an ideal compromise.
It won't stop, it can stretch, and it'll keep heavy objects.
But let's stick together over the volume.
According to the tables in the basic arrangement, it is 428 l, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, not against the Czech Republic's most sold car of this class - Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the youthful product, then we'll find that Peugeot is behind a lot of significant 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when loading a carriage, this value is critical.
But if I'm going to raise the positive, I have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a spark-ignition four cylinder with a volume of 1.6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old woman should look like who drives a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consuming, and it's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a pesty pattern that acts like she's got a stuffed suit in her exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list will indicate
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a ignition 14 for 329,900 CZK will still pass.
Our unit costs 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
Tested equipment Premium will then drop the equipment for another 80 000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, electrical rear window control...
Just a car costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extra equipment at Fabia's and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's no choice but to make a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools failed
At British schools, children from Eastern Europe are coming, and local residents are concerned about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original population are escalating into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Conflicts, bullying, and fights between students have also moved into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police detained a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten - year - old student with an iron rod.
The guilty one forbids that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The men's girls were supposed to honor him with racist remarks and throw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed to a bus stop and started swimming at us.
When I told him to let it go, he leaned on us apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant event for The Times.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local settlers even referred to disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is beginning to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who are on their way to work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It's really an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it in a fuller and richer list.
There's only one island, but you'll find a lot more, and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilleans.
For the Spanish, Cuba used to be the garden of their conquest of America.
Columbus described her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a transshipment of treasures that the Spanish in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of 20 years.
He let him build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibitions) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew, and there were large boulders of cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, just outside of Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Media, they left their signatures to showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the precious Nacional Hotel, you will be mixed with a cocktail at your request.
And the cult cars from the '50s drive around Havana by now, because once imported seals and fiats in the salty and humid air had already rotted.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is considerably lost, nowhere around is there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there is.
Other places also turn into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another cubit, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated by the trains in particular.
A third of the large plantations were tied to sugar plants after narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renovated for many decades, and so there are functional machines that are located elsewhere in museums.
Where do you want to go?
The most famous places most of Cuba's visitors won't miss.
And so it's about Varader, or Havana, you don't have to write too much.
Perhaps just to remind you that in Hemingway's already mentioned settlement there is a museum and who likes this writer should not be missed.
The Viñales Valley is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba, the Viñales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
Mogs, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil is caught in their hollows, making them also densely dense.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final appearance you can meet if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Maybe it's interesting to someone that Major Zeman's Chilean work was spinning there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth has become the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has almost remained unchanged in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and Mount Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that region to the rest of the country.
She's the one who helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why it didn't work out, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancon beach, or the valley of the Sugarvars.
The evening should then go to Casa de la Música, who lives after dark, and the music in her is silent over the morning.
Baracoa
A town just east of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful on the island.
Indeed, this view is already affecting the road itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánama must overcome the high and divided mountains and pass through a nature that human activity has hardly marked.
The eastern island of Cuba was recorded by UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo Hotel are visible several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Isla de Pinos, about the tropicana cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patronage Caridad del Cobra, about the santeria, about the African religions that the descendants of the former slaves recognize, about all of this could be described by many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States' mission to Afghanistan.
NATO, according to Defence Minister Robert Gates, should plan a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to imagination, the representatives of countries in the southern part of the country in Edinburgh in Scotland agreed.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement today, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and the coordination of allies.
While this week the United States, through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, has called NATO units to greater activity, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The next is to enable the residents to start their own further development of the economy and security," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to the US Army, the highest in five years.
The number of violent events rose by 27 percent compared to last year, in southern Helmand province by 60 percent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously think about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 per cent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is not enough," Reuters De Hoop told Japan's government in Tokyo at the end of the class talks.
Who's passive?
There have also been disputes among the participating countries in recent months about whether all allies are doing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for being passive.
"The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are placed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and fighting rights on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard Sun this week described German soldiers as sloths.
"Afghan punks discovered: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit during a football match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will go up by a trillion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, there is a sovereign debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
The government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in state budget management.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
In nine months this year, it has thus increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, the CZK 13.4 billion has been reduced.
The Ministry of Finance thus today confirmed its state debt data from early October.
Each Czech is owed over 84,000 crowns.
Over the course of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, we could not overcome the border of the trillion crown until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," analyst Patria Finance David Marek told the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimír Picora sees this: "We could get over one trillion during 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be more willing to save, it could move on to 2010.
But I do not assume this change," he said.
Debts are growing
The sovereign debt consists of central government debts and is primarily due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by treasury vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has so far increased by 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion this year.
The country's foreign debt has so far grown by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called tradeable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has dropped by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average maturity of the sovereign debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13% year-on-year for the first to third quarter, which is really a lot of how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will be trading what it will be doing when pension reform is here," Picora said.
Better than expected
According to the 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy, the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in state budget management.
The amount consists primarily of the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidating Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, the ten billion pension reserve, the financing of state bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is scheduled to go to court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher sentenced in Sudan to insult Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night by a Khartoum tribunal and expelled, according to her lawyer.
Britain has been accused of having six to seven - year - old students give the teddy bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with whiplash.
This British 40 - year - old teacher, acting at the University of High School in the Sudan, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose the name for the class teddy bear.
"From the mouth of the children there will be eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in class, 20 of the 23 children eventually choose as the most popular name Mohamed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label on it, but the difficulty is in depicting the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that she knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said only "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many pupils of teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never in class talk about religion".
Recall that Mohammed’s first name is also the second most commonly given first name in the United Kingdom, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them to a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations, this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth round of talks Wednesday morning in the Austrian Baden, at the same time, without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations were over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period," he added, "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiation closes on 10 December
Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their last move to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population are, could appear in a clearer light by December 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to give their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August of this year, the Troika has been entrusted with new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10th.
On the contrary, the Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of management of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's supervision as the only gradual solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, independence is ready to declare unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo government President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden Hotel, where this "last chance" was held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "depends on the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Dominal effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise still comes into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"It does not mean, however, for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken solely by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end the way it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
He replied to reporters Fatmir Sedjiu that "the last word on status would be the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents, there would be "under agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland called out of his lust, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately start negotiations with the intention of resolving once and for all 60 years the ongoing dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, declare Bush and recall the obligations that both sides derive from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the words after the American President and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and should touch on all aspects of the solution, by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, inter alia".
Olmert then addressed the Tribunal, which expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it should be planted in order to be closed during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the implementation of his "visit of two states", the Palestinian and Israeli, which exist alongside him.
Saudi Arabia announced that it had accepted a commitment from Bush in that sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories taken during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means 'crossroads in Middle East history in particular because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects', according to Prince Saúd in an interview that he provided to an Arab-speaking diary protected by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., cops don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (IGPN), a police car drove by Louise-Michel on Sunday shortly after 17:00 in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The driver was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was driving at 40 to 50 km/h, but had no side lights on," the police source explained.
Green motorcycle of Kawasaki, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to ride on public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without helmets, drove "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the police car on the left side after not giving priority to the right," one policeman said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (paved an ancestor, cracked windshield, broken bumpers) testifies to the impact velocity.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly, and she announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned the investigation of "intentional killing and failure to assist persons in the threat", which was also directed by the department departemente de la súrété publice du Val-d'Oise (the department of the regional police department Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excluded, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
According to the official, the three witnesses who were interviewed on Sunday evening confirmed "the police, namely that the mini-engine approached them relatively quickly on the left".
Some rig, no doubt caused by the friction of the ground clips, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained locked up until the moment the police car was able to stop.
The vehicles were secured and passed through technical expertise.
There was a autopsy on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, in Williers-le-Bell, there was a rapid spread of talk about police officers leaving the crime scene quickly without providing first aid to two young people.
The IGPN also had to rule out "any serious error" at this point, in all caution.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which to be very careful," the police source noted.
The journal "Liberation" met with an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"Right away, my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, we ran down to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw "a limping, completely frightened cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with rapidly growing tension and confidence that the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were taken by car by colleagues who had arrived in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Don't let anyone claim that the police authorities didn't rush to help the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Voltage in Pakistan is on the rise
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration since the declaration of the exceptional state of General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the special condition were injured by tear gas grenades that, according to witnesses, used orderly force.
The last ones responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called in.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called after the general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of the religious parties grouped into the politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "insulted the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and the waste to those who took an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharp's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is a direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October, should have been declared legal.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All we are witnesses is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court rulings," said an official in The News.
Parvíz Musharraf's promise to surrender to the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not pay" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform until November 15th, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government has also reversed the ongoing speculation that the army's deputy chief would order President Musharraf to be sent to prison at home.
More than a third of pregnancy is still an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is unexpected today, reports a study conducted by the French Institute of National D'études démographeriques (Ined)- The National Institute of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which in France has enacted contraception.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as misplanned or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, Ined estimates.
The law of contraception has only made it possible to check fertility better, the Institute argues, and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One pair of five even has a monthly birth calculated exactly and, if possible, in spring, which is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make remarkable repairs to the scattered solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky way out into space that collected records about the duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed at which it was planned and the level of "cut-off" that astronauts spent on repairing.
Problems appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship explained the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing mole for lab modules.
These, however, need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17th half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor on its final position.
After it was moved, the crew began decomposing 70 meters of solar panels of the module.
And in this was one of the panels, decomposing as a pulley, resulting in a cable creaking, damaged on an area of almost one metre.
The decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to perform a checkout on the Discovery ship and then go fix another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship attached to the station's shoulder and perform repairs.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the US Aviation and Space Office (NASA).
The tall, stable, very reverse, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this original profession was entrusted by a doctor to "operation" the "broken" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and secured some sort of "walls" on the damaged sites.
He was assisted by another spacewalker, who remained close to the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, i.e. a mini-cayka with an insulating device, to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented, and "after the cooking" were made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely decomposed and then inventoryd his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day’s rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS’s actions in the Paris Stock Exchange are losing, after the airline and defence industry have announced that it will have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays in the slow progress towards the development of the A400M aeroplane engine, which is a condition for the start-up flight.
The price for the reduction of the delay in the delivery of the military cargo aircraft, reported in October, was calculated "to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European constructor EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new outlook for profit before deducting interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also announced that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
Let us recall that the production results of EADS fell by 86 % in 2006 in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380 aeroplane.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French army would be in October 2009.
Decision on status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without intense expectation: the Russians will mostly elect President Putin's side, United Russia.
Confirming that, after the end of only a very few free election campaigns, their pursuit of stability, or authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the House of Representatives, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters at public law stations of a pre-screened television message whose content is kept secret.
It does so from the position of leader of the United Russia, the prokremmel party, which is supposed to celebrate a crushing victory.
When the ambassador of foreign states was admitted yesterday, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfied with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish honest, as transparent and as open an election as possible, elections without the slightest defect to beauty," he added.
There's no such thing in the eyes of the opposition.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says "there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Jelcin".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion in the Garry Kasparov chess game, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to have a restraining order against her lawyer.
"The Russians are left with the mentality of a homo Soviet."
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple, tense expectations, two far more open questions are identified:
- "Who will become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2nd 2008; candidates may be represented by December 23rd.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia that chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire parliamentary line, as it did in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians are left with the mentality of homo Soviets, they do not feel the masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
Historian Nikolaj Koposov of the University of State of Sankt-Peterburg notes the time-distant connections: civil society has gained, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delays; that famous common spirit has delayed the creation of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "Putin has applied to the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, it is rather that this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "voluntaryly surrendering their personal responsibilities", which they have recently demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of the total number of 85 Russian chiefs) run by the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In the name of stability, too, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Credičenko, a four-and-a-half-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Depleted Memory
After more than sixty years in the confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which correspond to the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opened to the public.
47 million archival documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available until now only for "humanities" purposes, which means individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorised persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the ratification process for this agreement by all States is over, opening yesterday has become effective.
Sensitivity
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow us to examine "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, have been opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arresters built by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work subjected to civilian citizenship, providing them with evidence of their internalisation in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Studies of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
EU and India want to enter into free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave a green European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is immensely inspiring for both economies" and "India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner specified. The Asian and European giant will jointly change "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services" this week, Danièle Smadja, Head of Delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durão Barroso.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England announced its intention to mitigate current concerns that the credit market conditions would deteriorate again and announced a bid of £10 billion in a five-week tender at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an unusually long offer.
"In an effort to ease the concerns that conditions in the financial markets will be very negative at the end of the year and to provide banks with greater certainty in the way in which they secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Communication reported.
The Bank points out that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually take a week.
The BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates in between days" of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interbank interest rate was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the rates of charge which have deterred banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the pound-to-euro exchange rate, many prefer to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement population, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address Socialist proposals (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal for a law on purchasing capacity, which is equivalent to rejection of the text.
For the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law was received under the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted by the Presidency of the PS on Tuesday, including an increase of 50% in employment premiums, the renewal of fluctuating HINTs, transport cheques or rent regulation.
Since the UPP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the session was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on purchasing capacity.
The head of the PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to the amendment of the Finance Act, which Parliament will discuss next week.
A new festival is being born
As a result of many speculations that the C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of the British Organizer Melvin Benn, announced.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who inspired the current festival movement in America without overstress," reported Charlie Jones of the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer destination station for campers.
The festival should take place from August 8th to August 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, previously known under the name Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most recognized festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helms of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, also has production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in touch with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become into politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"We were fortunate to have the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to start a great festival in an exceptional place, which will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 were resurrected by the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago Grant Park, after they graduated from the festival scene in 2002 with the organization of Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M$ and $11.3M$.
Both of these festivals are taking place in the city environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place rather in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in some way so that we can create the impression of both the rural festival in Europe and the urban festival in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The village of Vineland, including the mayor, is delighted to support the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims that "they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome the festival which will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to that of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will understand 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is only printed.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide spectrum of viewers if possible," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promotion in the last year's Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard for the Governor to get into the claws?
"You have to be careful, it's an industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal to be favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those they will consider the best," he said.
Celebration for Festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcotte's promotion of local film is a priority.
The Oscars race has already begun.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether it is festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be a matter of introducing Québec films to draw attention to them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
Age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Festu.
Will it happen at the end of the year on the stock market to the marathon? Experts distributed the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are expecting me to have a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif considers that "from a statistical point of view, December has a positive development on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because markets exist in current contexts, at least in the short term, with certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that the stock market is moving in recent weeks, and state that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest in the absence of alternatives to guarantees, in particular a strong income effect affected by the return on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a calm process, not without volatility, "especially because the impact of the likely decline in FED rates (Federal Reserve System) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the manager of the sale of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year somewhat closer to 16,000 points thanks to the repurchase of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension accessions that occur each year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, because he believes that the marathon will occur earlier, in the second December week after an extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not consider that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "that is why we could observe a reflection of the index generated by US reports on the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex brings out new maximum quotas.
The solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year it is the turn of the strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olcha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it comes to it.
"ACS has been in position again for several months now and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cycle consumption will be ahead in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during Christmas sales.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technologies will also do very well, even though they are not too represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of decline in two cases.
The actual marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be in the order of the fifth profit year (yet Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
As well as for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of its branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured itself that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions on the cancellation of the opening period of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening period by one afternoon, even though not for the public.
The results of this experience from Popular will be decisive to ensure that other entities join this initiative, which supports the opening time of trade, whether or not.
That is exactly the purpose of the project set by the Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, traders and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, it is only about adjusting existing ones.
Therefore, the bank is modernising branches already in business zones by adapting them to the customer profile in individual streets.
This extension of the opening time is complemented by another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
Ángel Rivera, Business Director, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it moves from six employees to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The popular bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via, and River seems to have been a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized in immigrants who are operated under the brand Mundocredit also has a very long opening time and is open even on Sunday and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' Rivera says.
They've just agreed with Telefonico on the sale of mobile phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antony for the first time on the stock exchange 3
We did it.
That statement was made yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Executive President of Telecinco, in his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he noted that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival, Antony 3.
Only one thing ruined his joy: 'What I am sorry for is that it did not happen because we would grow more, but because we had fallen less', he declared.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit has shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
The stock value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) is thus EUR 4,488.88 million according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor, Antena 3, who dropped 1.52 % yesterday and dropped by 40,5 % in total since January, has a half-value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies assessed is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogocable, 2,518.53 million Pisa (Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at the same price, and how we will evaluate it in the watch'.
Telecinco announced last week that it is counting on overcoming a billion gross advertising revenues to become the first television channel to convince Giuseppe Tringali, Executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast data were actually achieved, this TV channel would have recorded an increase in advertising turnover by 3.6 % compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million) while the net revenues of the television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is the increased pay out rate for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange: in 2006 the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarria, divided 100 % of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early in decision making, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whom we have already raised 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is experiencing a certain amount of fatigue in these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his estimates of profit to Telecinco, 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the expected increase in income from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approved MiFID transposition effective from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the Government has subjected the hearing of the regulation developing the new law to the effect that both of them enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the European Union supervisory authorities.
This new regulation will allow the provision of financial advice services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial service companies (ESIS), financial advice companies (AIFs), which join securities companies, securities brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments is being expanded so that multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems are connected to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock brokers.
The law further obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires a report of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the deliberations of the Congress's Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which it is noted that the securitised claims are considered to be a "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the USA with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the Directive was used for the legal definition of functions which codifiers may hold in the field of economics and management 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of a Royal Decree setting out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and customer acquisitions for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB) policies to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistics Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will come to light on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain relatively high levels"
The second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November ISC increase to 4.1% was "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress's billboards pointed out that "even if it's not a positive number", Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union has been "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the Minister of Economy said to the data presented today.
Virginia plans to earn 42 billion euros in three years with Northern Rock
Since the North Rock crisis took place in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits have dropped by more than 50 % to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined during the two and a half months of client mistrust even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the name of the entity with its Virginia Money brand, needs about a quarter of the income invested in the British banks over the next three years in order to get the remaining £18 billion and achieve the goals of £30 billion.
Richard Branson's group, known in the United Kingdom for its impressive advertising campaigns, is planning to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Bank Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virginia consortium, which consists of three other companies, such as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, in the early morning, the civilian guard detained the current mayor of Totana, the People’s Party, because of his alleged involvement in the corruption practices of the construction that were discovered this week.
In addition, one of the council secretary and chief of local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a current human rights MP, in May of this year, and until then, the mayor of the village, who, according to the investigative sources of Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of the entire company.
Police officers continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices in construction, was accused of being discovered earlier this week.
As Caden SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'humanist' Member Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the investigation sources, Morales' alleged commissioning for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which was requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted the offer of the state headed by the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to chair the Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer by Prime Minister and Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general election under the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party) candidature in Toledo, and in the event that the Socialists win the general election, he became chairman of the Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief of executive's offer to the former minister justified that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this policy from La Manchy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of the Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November his decision not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to be able to fight climate change in the framework of university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he had left two years ago.
He further stated that, like citizens, he knew who would be the deputy minister of the economy if the PSOE won the election, his party wanted to make a "transparency form" announcement about who would chair the Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not a house of blackmail or screaming" and to achieve that "it will become more and more like the citizens".
"Unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where Congress cannot speak peacefully and peacefully, the Prime Minister of the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also gave praise to the address of current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so far, so that he would not be reduced to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution both by those who sceptically look at its predictions and by those who favour other political and social struggles, they must demonstrate strong cohesion.
In addition, to have a leader of the movement, who is the Prime Minister as Zapatero, and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal compels him to explain why the activity or inaction of his government has contributed significantly to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it makes him as clear as possible as possible to explain to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to halt climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay for saving the planet.
But we couldn't wait for such explanations, nor could we wait.
It's because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centimeter from the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful to electoral campaigns that he doesn't even speak, he doesn't blame, he doesn't demand anything, but he's an adornment of the possessors and encourages him.
If he's limited to being just a virtual contractor and he doesn't ask us to ride a bike and cool off with a windmill.
Mayor and head of local Totany police arrested for suspected corruption practices in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civilian Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andrea, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one of the entrepreneurs in hospitality, for suspected of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to a town hall where he is now with a number of police officers, who have also arrived at the Construction Commission and the City Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
The three arrests came to six, which took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal fees during the last election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two others have not been arrested, but are charged with summary proceedings before the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first arrests were brought to justice today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Province of Pontevdra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by the Criminal Investigation Unit in the construction of the Civilian Guard Operations Central Unit, whose members, apart from the arrest, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies associated with the arrests, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (the province of Madrid) and Totana.
There was only one person imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of the very well-known owner of poultry meat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex of the city of Totany, which would be the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of a municipality with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunia, Venezuela and Fernando el Catolico in the town of Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
And that's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsinkiin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the Pisa report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18th, the same day that the Blackburn book critics appeared:
"The content of the course of philosophy entered public debate in connection with the tragedy at the school in the town of Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the education councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the Helsingin Sanomat journal that the professors take a critical opinion on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague informs of the introduction of a crime of downloading from the Internet into a criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you disappear from the store at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you subtract up to 1,000 euros from the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the criminal rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to take part in fights than in changing compacts.
Participation in riots is from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Penal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate would be from six months to two years
(§ 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious than downloading a film on DVD under § 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by more than the provision of pornographic material to young people (Section 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, someone's hand is gone, and that's it.

My attending doctor is pushing one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much they earn.
The study was carried out at Bonn University using magnetic resonances on the tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the group The view of the neurocognosis of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant in the research reacted correctly and his colleague failed."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursued by a Balkan war criminal from the Court's State Attorney's Office in The Hague for eight years.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006), in Spain, is not given, which at the pace of the detective thriller follows from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the persecution of fugitive criminals and the pressure on the countries concerned to tighten the network.
What kind of insurance is it appropriate for me?
The insurance of a car which protects drivers in the event of an accident represents a significant expenditure which depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, driving licence holding, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking shall receive an agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for the purpose of taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
The insurance price shall be determined in the light of the various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident occurs, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over 25 years of age and women must pay less insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their being cautious.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that persons living in marriage had fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving, and thus on the likelihood that it will have an accident.
The frequency of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must examine the situation well in order to choose the insurance best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variable for the selection of a type of insurance which, apart from meeting the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages, such as a lack of driving experience and a short hold of a driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are even cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all insurance risks in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would provide for the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"Part of the remuneration of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price which will be higher, the lower the participation would be," explains Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe in Spain, an insurance intermediary on the Internet.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation by ensuring that the client is able to cope with the damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and the loss of a vehicle.
It's a recommendation.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, the malus is an increase in the above-mentioned basic rate.
"The bonus and the malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, it makes it easier for drivers to arrange insurance, as the client risk index decreases, thanks to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and not in driving," the director of the European society in Spain assures us that most accidents occur in the second year of management, when "the fear of the new one" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks if, of course, his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be the lowest risk index clientele and thus their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all insurance risks (which could amount to EUR 300) or high premium, insurance extended to other operators, starting with the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to provide insurance against all insurance risks (of which EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it is a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly explore insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will target their forces this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, because for Italy it would be the first, and for the Scots it would be the decision to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a procedure in the fifth draw game in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that Shahtíor does not get six points ahead of him, which will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two group D games will be played a week before the sixth round is over, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will be the first to perform the thirteenth in the semifinal, in an effort to enter the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems most likely, even though both teams will try to compete for the victory, because the Italians won't want to be tactical on the home ground and Celtic knows that after winning would be the first and he would have a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's men could even lose if the Shahtíor doesn't win, but they can't rely on it, because in the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) will step forward, but won the first straight game (2:0).
And so the players AC Milan will try to ruin the evening for the Scots who believe that the second time they will get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just like they won in the same game in the previous goal competition with Kaka in extension (1:0) after state 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hoping that the "rossoneri" will win will be the Shahtíor for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for the process to the eight-final and for the stay in the UEFA.
Although it is the last and there is no way to continue in the highest European competition, it could win third place in one victory, so it would play in the UEFA.
The first concert during the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
A group of Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 viewers of their first tour since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place in Vancouver declared that their band's reunion was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present for a concert, including a video that depicts the history of this group that caused sensations in the late 1990 ’ s.
Returns and world tours take place at the same time as the new album released in Spain by the EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated bracelets donated by their husband "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the start of Victoria Beckham's performance, she said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed her nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the reunification of the group that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled and we all love each other very much".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
So at first, according to CTV, the group flew into Vancouver with the Virginia Airlines special.
At the airport, they were expected by an army of guards.
Five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 December and 7 December).
He'll be in Madrid on December 23rd.
Concerns over a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the prices of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel may be affected in Western Europe.
The majority of Russian fuels exported to the European Union (EU) are piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas prices, Russia will be charged higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state own a gas monopoly, Gazprom, seeks to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas he receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters, Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatolij Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev resulted in a reduction of supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a crushing fall in exports to Western Europe, which has sharply increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but most of them remain underexploited.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve the control of criminal records in non-European employees.
A recommendation from the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to a June attack at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel employed.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was directly interested in the June attacks on the Glasgow Airport on personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Eighty-two-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep to the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of contacting attempts at bombings in the United Kingdom.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office states, among other recommendations, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau Directives, which assists employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in many ways agrees with its own pre-employment policies, but also added: "Our report points out areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
BMA President Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in Scotland's NHS work well and it is not clear what further value these remarks will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher also because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
These included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently redrafting the pre-employment control policy and directive for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nikola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, will consider the recommendation of the report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated Pre-Employment Control Directives of all staff - including foreign - scheduled to be issued next month.
Joy Division controls film prices
Control, a biography film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the best film price.
The prizes were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis played the role of director Anton Corbijn and later as Toby Kebell.
Lady Judy Dench was named the best actress for the thriller's scandal notes.
And the star of the Daniel Craig Bonds won Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world stage.
The prizes were presented at the Roundhouse of London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning – because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won his best actor cookie as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Prize for an extraordinary benefit to the British film.
This 50 - year - old, whose films include Scum, Neil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next work of Indiana Jones, the Kingdom of Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, the great actor of his time, I am very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Among the patrons and patrons of Bif are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Evan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Niggy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil installations as well as on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
The al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, the United States allies, since 2003, i.e. from the invasion to Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil installations in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid reaction unit of 35,000 members to defend the facility from the failed attack of al-Qaida on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who slipped into the country.
She further stated that the militants planned to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied forces and the Shiite government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heresy.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that authorities have co-opted many priests in Saudi Arabia to support a royal family that controls the government.
The militants - supported by the challenges of leader al-Qaeda Sauda Usama bin Laden to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the state television interior ministry spokesman.
The 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was intended to promote "tafirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims designated as non-believers and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate in Venus may be a look into the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the moving European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's obstinate twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and are orbiting similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on earth and could have been inhabited.
But a flushed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and a lower rate of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and it is ravaged by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings from the Venus Express European Space Agency probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a mediocre view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University Department of Physics and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission said: "It is increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to draw up a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps even with a population environment, billions of years ago."
Police have detained "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
The police spokesman said that three people were arrested and the material was investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still on.
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and submitted them to candidates.
None of the questions sent on Wednesday 28 November was as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the second-party debate on YouTube.
But questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican party for next year's elections.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to the only topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest republican topics.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something encouraging: the speaker recorded the peaks of consent when candidates spoke about a hard approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the country's main candidate, and Mr Romney, who made a breakthrough in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was soft as a New York Prime Minister on an illegal immigrant.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two fought particularly stubbornly when the applicants asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Other candidates, like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on this subject.
None of these two have a chance to be nominated, but they're both in the game for starting to get alarmed about immigration sooner and harder than the others.
At least for immigration, candidates have roughly the same opinion: greater tightness at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the republicans to forget or minimize the conflict between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why in the past he supported the holding of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether simulated heating should be considered torture.
One reporter asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through this, Mr. Giuliani suggested that although the Bible is his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another tax collector asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the recent Iowa survey because of his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning his laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr Huckabe's rise in Iowa is hiding with recent success in earning money and Ron Paul's loud joy in the middle debate.
These two have bounced off the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning report on the American size on the lips, winking at both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labourist Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a custom for British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
There doesn't seem to have been any orders sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been smelled.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have gone by without it being discovered that a wealthy businessman after four years had masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling the elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by research, there was hope that it would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly humorous President of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unburied rescue of the troubled bank of Northern Rock has shown weaknesses in management and weak judgment under fire.
The ill-conceived proposals to amend the tax code have brought the companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative misinformation.
The three retired generals launched a rebellion in the Lord's House; they protested the executions in military spending because they claimed that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would irreversibly be heading toward his end.
Even so, governments can achieve a turning point that they find to be difficult to rule.
People don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but mostly they'll put away their mistrust if the new gang takes over.
Now that it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not improving anything, and he doesn't have to be in the office for long, this shift is gone: the government becomes a leak, the ministers start doing briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new church against other political leaders.
As far as he wants to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Financial Office are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as the long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can easily conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
They're not as horrible as the conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one died or was lied to.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest excitement over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
That may be true, but it wasn't up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' procedure, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour Money Seeker, who learned about the bountiful gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown has no complication; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these fences, even though the bulk of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own side, but he diluted his decision by reaching for a certified instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by an additional bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find the permanent Chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has not had one in six months, and follow up on the real reform of the financing of the political parties.
This would require Labour to work closely with conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a good head start in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is to be inconspicuous integrity and high competence.
Cardboard sharks
Does the crisis of subprime mortgages affect the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, they naturally begin to stir their spinal cords around.
Now that the American real estate market is failing, predators are targeting the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that if credit card losses were to be infected with additional consumer credit options, 99 billion dollars could be achieved from subordinate mortgages.
The signs of tension are clear.
The number of inability to pay (at more than 30 days of late payment) and write-off accounts (accounts considered necessary by the provider).
Last month, HSBC announced that it lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to non-solvent credit card loans.
But it's too soon to panic.
There are still few written accounts and inability to pay.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, 3.89% of the rate of insolvency in the third quarter was almost the whole percentage point below the average.
The deterioration rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in US Personal Bankruptcy Act 2005 resulted in a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make up a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good level of maturity, which shows how many consumers pay monthly from their debts.
And trust in securities secured credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup Research Company predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct ways to spread the infection between the crisis of subordinate mortgages and the credit card market are definitely there: when they dry up loans for real estate, consumers are more likely to owe themselves via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers are looking at cash flow rather than at the value of hand-held items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of lenders.
They may even be beneficial to the lenders.
Consumer motivation to pay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets decreases below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up on the list of priorities for repayment.
Card publishers can also react more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid price changes in handling items.
"It will not happen that one beautiful morning we would just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of a minor mortgage-style explosion is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those spinal cords.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in a fraud connected with the former financial manager of Enron Andrew Fastowa, changed their confession on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven counts of fraud, when they were supposed to participate in financial fraud with Fastov in 2000 -- to be rich at the expense of their employers -- were denied.
They were supposed to stand before the court in January.
However, during the court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for two years, which lasted the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 pointed out to Mr Fastow that he had been the object of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
The indictment against bankers -- who have earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to form a fraud along with Fastowa and his former principal, Michael Copper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastowa, who was the architect of a lot of enron frauds that tricked Enron after the spiral toward declaring bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch as zero, but our three British people knew that it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Cooper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Copper a stake in this company of $250,000.
According to the prosecution, Fastow has falsely informed Enron that the energy company will pay for its share in this Greenwich NatWest branch of $20 million.
But those 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers got $7.3 million on the indictment and Fastow, Copper, and the others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the overthrow of Enron.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper's been under sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three British men were on bail for $1 million, ordering them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or to report declining speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief employee Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the collapse of society.
Skilling is in the hands of more than twenty-four years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-infirmity
The price of Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, it is, of course, small to return.
"He can carry as many as 18 passengers," says Dan Führer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Führer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Show, which is a four-day orgy of an exhibited consumer in a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stands, hoping that the newly wealthy Russians would attract everything from mahogany-exposed yachts to diamonds decorated carblocks, for which even 50 Cent would not be ashamed.
Mr. Führer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side booth.
"It's a nice car, but it's the fifth and the corporals against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money flows into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously rich and went to Europe where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, fourth-year listener at Davis's centre of Russian and Euro-Asian studies in Harvard.
Like the Saudi pitchers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH group, brought together a conference on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes magazine of 53 billion people with total assets of $282 billion.
In addition, the Local Institute of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "secondary" millionaires in Russia whose assets add up to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of Russians lived under the existing minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are finely groomed and men are all for the entire estate."
When walking in the evening dress on Sunday evenings, the 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatovová and five - year - old Svetlana Turovcov declared themselves and their clients to be millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was dressing up as a veteran of red carpets, next to whom Joan Rivers looked like a domestic path.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on fresh rich people, brand-controlled Russian buyers who were willing to sit for several hours in road traffic so that they could walk through a warehouse that was screaming mixed by Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fishes, Mövenpick ice cream, pool tables at peace, apartments in Dubai, pumpkins Gund and travan.
Members of the free public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before rembrandt's painting of hand painted blue tiles in super-life size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gold."
Indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashing logs to little known stamps of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls day and day.
And some of them were shopping.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, said he sold two mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, for $70,000.
Also on the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end high-end cars with high-end alarms, that his company sold a clearly orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, listed a luxury car to sell three car chains in the style of connected chains for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a bicycle designed for a Russian casino owner who had a plot covered with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants bicycles made of ostrich skin or portraits of his wife from a bowling peekonio still doesn't have to ride those bikes," said Mr. Karapetian.
"They'll put them in their garage for 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" in the present does not mean anything very exclusive, given the high price increases of the local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red telephone booths of British style filled with a million dollar column of fake bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said that his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The neighbors stopped by tossing around a bunch of money, or to let friends take a photo of themselves on their cell phone, resting in the middle of a replacement fortune, or just stuffing their pocket a couple of million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of this restaurant about a little healthier and watched an ambulance that came to the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car was soon joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the medical examiner come," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Nevada Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that led the newar police to send a wave of grief.
Miss Arroy has been an assistant police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroy in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Nevada police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission and leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County, Theodore J. Romankova, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died from an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities continued to say little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is reportedly Flora Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Miss Castro's authorities had listened.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday, at Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink bush in the attic and a dalmatin barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, there was a blue barrel in the open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillan" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived at the New York Police Department 25 years later, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in biting into his new city's hateful and harsh political culture.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or this one,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to stronger world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic rose yesterday after the hopes of the market that the Federal Bank would try to calm down lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were strengthened by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of the Fed, said that in responding to the continuing pressure on financial markets, the drivers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of an obvious effort to calm the irritable markets amid signs of a resilient credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent excitement has " partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets by the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persisted, the possibility of financial conditions for households and companies further deteriorated.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to provide additional fresh capital benefits to the US markets and perhaps further interest rates reductions to stabilise the credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The effects of financial belief were underlined by Bear Stearns’ announcement that it would cancel 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global labour force, as part of lowering costs due to compensation for heavy losses caused by the unspent wager on the granting of subordinate housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit pressure on the markets showed full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash packages auction had been loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, the largest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release over-standard money into the London monetary markets increased by the fact that the rates of the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rose after an uninterrupted growth since 12 November to its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kanda, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
And in the broader context, no less relevant than the first Sri Lankan Test, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the best position in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision-making of the aid, and because Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, starts filling in applications for the national sampling post, although not necessarily for the full time.
The one who won't be put in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is no longer at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over a lower level, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than abilities.
Not only in cricket is the choice demanding and requires a judgment that must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, isn't it?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerie, both smart young leaders with good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the committee - the place is for only one.
Who's to say what level is right for the cricketers if he can't get down or swim on the next one?
Of course, numbers have a great impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
On the team, the cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take the Wicket, and the ranger needs a regular chance at starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a day-long cricketer.
Getting a look at the sampler is more complicated.
For example, in last season, there were many better ones, James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class crickets at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 on an equally modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for another.
If he's going to play Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can run or reach the career of both, or it also may not have a great impact.
Four years ago at Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class gave good performances, five crickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricket, who is in addition, although in Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today's training at Assisiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give Shah more experience than Bopar's youthful splendor.
There are arguments for both of us.
For Shah speaks his fiery and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class against six Boparovs, who, in twenty-seven years, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made in two shifts against the Caribbean in May at the Lord's Test, his home court in Middlesex, just ten runs, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the samplers when Vaughan wanted to retake him to the next match, his firing seemed to have taken off something of an elan that was so obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, Essex University has joie de vivre in its bones.
On the cricket field, nothing scares him, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and apparently shocks, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed skids on the local playgrounds, which it seems to suit, hand out effectively and launches confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm staying away from Bopara getting his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Cylon tea tickets suggest, he'll be the one who'll be playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and throwing away refugees who had run out of money or had expired visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the armed men who had evicted them from their homes.
Mansour Bus Station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy with dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
"Today I returned because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to cease fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariya called him with the help of the US Army to push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, which from his home in Sleikhu in northern Baghdad was driven away by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"The other day a few friends called me and told me that they were running a militia in Sleikhu against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and support my boys.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the appeal of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of interested citizens" who defend their neighborhood in the arms of the American army.
But more was said to have been brought back by visa obstructions and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 17-year-old father of three, voiced a suspicion shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for reducing violence is that Sunni have been pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which reduces tension in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again cause sectarian tension to exhale and lead to another fight.
Little Sara, good education
Germany's smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, and it excels even at the international focus of its higher schools.
In one educational area alone, Syria is concerned about the same deficit as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Syria, I explained yesterday after 50 that we are not French" - this self-ironic password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest social country.
In addition, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally been working closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the average number of Sarai children is admitted to high school - many of them without a high school degree.
"A professional education system is used in Syria," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
The fact that more than 1 out of every 5 young people is granted the right to study at a vocational university is that Sarska is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are many opportunities in Syria to combine practical and academic education.
The ability to study two fields is best given the number of inhabitants of the second in Germany.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates dropped by a third in recent years.
That is why the Syrian Ministry of Education has now ordered higher schools to form a campaign in engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to learn as soon as possible, the last year of the maternity school is free - a model that other countries take over.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, they will show up when a future comparative study is completed.
In the conduct of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20%.
In total, however, Syria has not improved as much as other social countries.
The baboons can do better than that.
And to disappoint Sarah's studies of Pisca do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could point exactly in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in high schools - although the inhabitants of Syria are not French.
Chavez's moving the clock.
What can't be seen will be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will allow hours in this South American country half an hour ago.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that hours will shift by less than four and a half hours under the new law against world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, inter alia, by forcing the United States to divide the time zones throughout the hours.
In the middle of local time, Chávez also announced that he was breaking relations with neighbouring Colombia because of the hostage-suspecting case.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it anymore because of my self-esteem," said Chávez, who is pushing for the reform of the constitution that citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
This reform would greatly strengthen Chávez's power in the country.
The argument prompted Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe "swimming in the face" by his Venezuelan decision, criticised Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here sparked a stir: "por que no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - so there is a sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was expressed by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit of the vocal remarks of this leftist populist was so angry that he silenced him.
Germany faces lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are facing a decline in real wages this year despite a strong economic situation.
The experts justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation estimates, employees can realistically count on getting lower wages than they did last year in 2007.
"The blame is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMC Research Institute (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that by the new year the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties that it has to demand loans or contributions from the youth community, and the newspapers of this socially democratic policy have been quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the price increased by a total of three percent.
Venus is a hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its life-threatening atmosphere Venus Earth is more similar than ever before. The Venus Express European Space probe in Venus has recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightnings in the atmosphere and windy beliefs in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is approaching.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - caught electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus flashes from cloud to cloud at about 56 kilometers, wrote in a science magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of original matter on Earth, life could have been created by lightning. Storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
At Venus it was not so: "If life ever existed there, it must have been very long ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something could barely be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venuj is perhaps a hellish twin of the Earth, but he is a twin," Russell said.
Why did Venus, who is so much like the Earth, begin to develop quite differently, is the basic issue of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been sent solely for the purpose of the Venus study since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which drew closer to several articles of Nature magazine, did not only stress Venus’ uniqueness in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more similar to the Earth than was supposed to be," said Esa.
In addition to the already known winds in the north Pole, scientists have found a dark faith in the southern pole, which rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents on the Earth's Northern Hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spazale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system is made up of almost the same matter as Earth and with an average of 12 100 km is almost as big.
This planet designated as Jitrenka or Vecernica will orbit the Sun in almost 225 days.
But around its own axis it spins much slower. One day it takes 243 days on Earth on Venus.
Although Venus does not recall the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists suggest that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
But on Earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it disappeared into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, most of the atmosphere is in Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is demanding the closure of the party disputes due to the acceptance of the Dalai Lama at the Office of the Chancellor.
Directly criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler worries about the reputation of Germany and calls on the great coalition to end the fight around the acceptance of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not outside present ourselves as a nation that is not united in this issue," Köhler told economic newspapers Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal for me," Köhler said.
Although the president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was outraged that it was creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not abandon the traditional policy of a united China.
China also knows this," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the "showy" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but SPIEGEL also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to information.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, also located in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France
Street fighting with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France.
We must do everything possible to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not increase in street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
The barricades burned, the gunmen fired shotguns on the police. After serious youth disturbances in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions as will erupt in violence in our country.
We have to take this seriously," said the Hannover newspaper Neue Press.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate problems, Schäuble said.
Which means more than just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we record our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past night, youth and police in the northern suburbs of Paris were seduced by hard street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were required by the Turkish municipality's chairman in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "overly high".
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We must give the youth hope."
The president of the Turkish municipality added, however, that there is a greater social control of families in Germany, unlike France.
Moreover, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "Pretty much, but we have to be careful."
We have to let the youth "swiftly work and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Williers-le-Bell was mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter with lights flew over the area.
The authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several burning trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, there have been approximately 1,000 orderly forces that have been deployed for peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after visiting the suburbs of the interior minister.
In the riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bell, about 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night.
The next night, Toulouse's riots took over.
The riots sparked a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Attorney's Office, the police are not guilty of any harm to the death of the young.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The Chancellor's reality a distant output documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything from it.
What country does this chancellor actually live in?
After her heartless, careless and contentive speech in the general debate of the Federal Parliament, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should eventually manage.
Angela Merkel once responded with a very arrogant sentence to regret that she was too focused on foreign policy.
That's the province, she said, which showed that she didn't want to understand what critics were up to.
In the Federal House, she made it clear to everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
Merkel did not feel any real interest, even a sense of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "The Cloud" presented herself: a political one that excels over others, which runs into foreign politics and is expressed only vaguely there.
For example, climate protection: it praises the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit without ceasing, but no longer says how these climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such self-pity - so much immodest - the CDU president would have forgiven herself two years ago.
Now it's limited to the plethora of phrases that could make it more popular among people.
This approach damages her image of a pragmatist who does not need to be flattered because it solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela "The Clouds" are internal political issues of marginal concern.
Child poverty and the concern of low-wage people?
She's got a few sentences left on these topics.
It's worth noting how often the Merkels argue when it comes to child support.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to be able to pronounce at least the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be too specific, it's as if it's in a completely foreign field.
The Attack Department
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube took place in a heated debate in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is warning his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he made New York "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with strong regret: "I believe that his own house was just one such refuge," responds and prejudges former Governor Massachusetts that he was privately employed by immigrants without evidence.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear preference, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet users recorded and via Youtube sent videos serve only as such tips of the key topic.
"This is exactly the kind of policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain, his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who is pushing for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq, warns.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare his remorse or Romney for refusing to condemn a painful interrogation method called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the method of torture are important themes of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
So it turns out where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explained in a defiance and asked the party base and television audience for forgiveness for being a supporter of abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express himself in the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian life
The day after his resignation from the post of Supreme Commander of the Army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
President Parvíz Musharraf of Pakistan made a presidential oath on Thursday, and he will remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live ceremonies at the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani, who was subject to international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after he seized power in the bloodless military coup, the former general ruled for the first time as the civilian head of state.
By stepping down from the position of Chief of Armed Forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition that Musharraf declared on 3 November.
According to Chief of State Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will remove the exceptional situation soon after his oath, and will meet more of the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the declaration of a state of emergency at the beginning of November, occupied its favoured lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the northern Vaziristán tribal area and four others were injured.
The army spokesman said the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of the Krautuck are returning
The famous German group in the 1970s played again. Three members of the Harmonia group recaptured their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will include Live 1974, the cut from the best period of the band.
They were already much better known abroad.
The reported sensation then lies in the performance of three gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box of cables and buttons in front of them.
Thirty-five-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow white shirt sitting in the middle.
There's a seven-and-a-half-year-old Michael Rother on his left who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 37-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on synthesists, is on the right.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, certainly not, a traditional song will come into existence.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians very much.
Among Krautrock's lovers, the band's magazine Harmony caused a lot of excitement.
One thing is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pope, but it is certainly not enough to make this band suffer a painful loss for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't even a German celebrate his still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when he values his musical style, wrongly called Krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the remaining members of the Can Echo Group for life’s work in 2003, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their speech, the surprise of the viewers was no longer clear.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts, sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignoring home and worship abroad is one thing.
With the memory of the band Harmonia, we burden the memory needlessly, this trio only existed for two years, and even at that time it did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement of the Berlin Theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a phonograph company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but he gained the reputation as a guitarist with the Neu band!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the 16th - century ruins of Old Weserhof, they lived as members of the communes who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as they did in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to croak like a nanny.
Rather, it was life in such a Spitzwegian artistic entity.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the garbage disposal.
She's kept a lot of it.
The first album was called "The Music of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial hardships.
Raising crops was not just about self - knowledge.
Now released the "Live 1974" CD was cut from a record small, barely 50-member stage at a concert in Griessem.
Rother then expressed his desire for the members of Harmony to be evicted and to exercise occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a totally inappropriate request.
In 1975, the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Heat Heart".
The Cluster band came back to life in the '80s, and it's been more successful since then than Harmony ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griesemer.
His record company Grönland has taken the aim of Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Chapel Neu! was considered Rodeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The event at the Wildtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
This is what we have planned for the overall spread of the influence of Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will fill Harmony.
Brian One's daughter, accompanied by the strangest sounds in the hall: "The unique true music belongs to the future."
There are paintings where there is a producer with Harmony in the agricultural session.
To create a legend, it also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which are a set of devices with wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
Not by sticking microphones to organs and drums to get those never-heard-of self-produced tones out of the instruments.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to tech-impaired punks.
Nothing changes the Council of the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place sings emphatically "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Roots would be found in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever screams "'68!" in this place is not that far from the truth, but Harmony won't let herself out of peace right now.
Even the most obvious on the scene is carefully thought out.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either rob a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The motion picture either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop him at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: Karadaj and Mladić war criminals are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere is going to die.
We have lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played many popular, unserious roles in comfortable women's movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, they'll take a taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become a prey (Why must the names of the films nowadays be so long and entangled?).
Gere gives magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere might have become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a wreck of a similar monument still retains some remarkable charm.
But despite this triumph is The Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters cinemas this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save the Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, one of whom will fall in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbians are not here to be portrayed as the cause of all evil, this televised film changes too soon into shooting and action.
There's going to be something very similar about the Cobra 11 series, without the highway, but with the war.
In The Hunting Party, we can explore carefully why it has not been possible to make a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters, who appear to be "a tough", Serbian top war criminal, could at another time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (both of them Richard Shepard) possibly become the new "Apocalypse".
Both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not capable of, but their journey will become a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the penetrating and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after reporters have failed in the last five minutes to catch criminals and leave them with fair revenge from Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
And yet this film has a deep human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadić and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are extremely united) that they do not pursue persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of the famous Brecht poem.
It refers to the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party perform exactly such swollen heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers said that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were major failures.
One thing can be added: No good film about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always applies: When a star walks through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Border Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just a little too close in time.
After all, there must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler list.
Many films must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Helm Hunter", "The Apocalypse" or "The lead vests" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the writers do not have the ability to tell good stories without fail.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitch and Chaplin have not yet known how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically measured artistic view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "the Balkan War", he said, "The like only happens in that some things never change.
Many will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust gathers criticism for denying the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has come under severe criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
But Von Beust is pushing for realism in the estimation of chances.
On Wednesday, Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision "from the point of view of business as unfortunate".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," said von Beust of WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that in early December the Sports Union would decide on Munich's candidacy for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 timetable."
Yet this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
It seems to me that Hamburg won't go to the Olympics for the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy the chance by calling the plans early in this phase a funeral," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Ignoring the resignation would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at the general meeting of the General German College Sports Union.
Von Beust here did not announce Hamburg's candidacy at the University in 2015 as a substitute for organizing the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg High School Sports Union has only nominated for a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate pointed out that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been blocked by the Senate for years because it has been betting on the Olympics and has ruled out the construction of the apartments," MPs SPD Carol Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympics with the whole area being later used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Caring for a summer Olympic game in 2012 sparked its time in Hamburg with great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the terms of Sweden and the wooden crates doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden crates currently produced in Sweden cast on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadows.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of the 1968 "Brillo Boxes" of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes", an internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museum comes in Stockholm with the result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Moderna Museum dedicated its former director Pontus Hulten, are copies - as well as most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxy in New York in 1964, painted wooden crates that were based on the red-colored design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museum in 1968 presented - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes of cardboard. They were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but they were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their designs, just show pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in Modern Museum.
The witnesses there are now talking about fifteen boxes, which then rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned off for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hulten boxes were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined apart from six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their rink boards were painted with basic paint and decorated, were polished with oil white paint.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the color was applied without the previous basic coating directly to the cross-sectional plate - in addition, it was acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the Warhol official charter of the Brillo Boxes," Moderna Museum director Lars Nittve said: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York has not reached any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from her exhibition collections as "exhibitive material - copies".
Already in July, Authentiation Board announced that it would deal with these "primary charges", which were raised in the case of soapboxes.
The organization, however, has so far remained unrelentingly silent.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers, who were entrenched in a hotel in Manila, demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Insurgent leader Antonio Trillanes, who was blackmailing the president with manipulation and corruption in the elections, told hotel reporters that he refused to be held responsible for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were anchored in the building.
