There's a big comeback for the Czech loser.
Paul the Frenchman was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Frenchman, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to NHL.
A 30-year-old climber will be on the swing and soon he can get in the goal.
Former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Right in the middle of the game with Vegas he's been swapping, and since then he hasn't introduced himself at the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at a time when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to another.
“Pavel Frenchman will be out of sight for about three to four weeks with injuries in the lower part of the body,” the whole of Denver announced in early October.
His return to the goal in NHL eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning of American time he was called from a farm where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
The AHL accounted for 94,5 % of the measures.
The breeder of the Ice Hockey finally wants to push himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
Last year, he had hip problems, and he didn't catch the only game in a short pandemic year.
In NHL ‘France’ won 36 matches, its success rate is 92,3 %.
Charles wears Camille's dress on Christmas Eve, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife, Kate, chose as this year's Christmas wish a family photo taken during their journey to Jordan.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photograph on which Camille’s hut helps to put on a robe.
British BBC news station informed about this on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, coworkers, and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress has also Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate, it's not even clear when it was created.
Last year, a royal family for a photograph designated as a Christmas wish posed on a package of straws in front of a pile of wood in their village headquarters in Norfolk County.
The image, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles' successor to the throne with his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them at the Ascot in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a cloth on his face, is helping Camille put on her dress with a color-coordinated dress.
Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, Hardy denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr to have a promising million crowns from Prague's Slavia for his league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the Red Whites had not allowed any corruption.
The server published a copy of police interviews, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up last summer at the championship club, is mainly her former sports director.
The former influential red-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the then Second League Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in a case among the accused.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for receiving the title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police authority had with it the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from the officials of SK Slavia Praha was to have a promising million payment, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The hard man refused any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the ratios in Czech football and offered a opposition alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence the judges in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard," said Tztík for the List of Reports.
In follow-up, among other things, Nezmar inadvertently insults some former players of Slavie's dark skin and also slanders his former boss, Hardy.
The case of alleged interference by the referees opened a police intervention in several places last mid-October, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most built in the affair is Berbr, which no longer fits in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping cold war.
The works will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the artillery must carry the shells manually without covering).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, Prague V3S has already been able to dispose of the specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - small and small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got stories like this.
I've got a chase right next to town.
The river was crawling with nutrients and causing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came here, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat still and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course, the fox left in a moment.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost took a shit, waving a man on all sides, so I called him to say it was on a fox.
Before I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, the arch of a man being a Prussiar.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things go to your feet and you should be fine.
Vojciech vs Hamaček.
Internally, the respirators were much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing clothing, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavir, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts per respiratory agent differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why were the prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy the auction?
Lenka Kabrhel speaks to the editor of the server andRozlas Dominika Kubishta.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (as if I am not affected by the memories of ČSLA, which passed through the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be picked up, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is getting more complicated, so the ability of the bookmarks will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition to the modern conventional conflicts, where there is anyone who can put, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to exercise again.
And in the end, backups/territorial defences are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where they lead a mass guerrilla, and it is also an expressed necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic there will be a fight only in the conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant and we do not have the appropriate geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have one.
Then there's a situation where you see a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, and he's in the attack alone between two or even three Swiss, and you're like, "What do you think's going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll choose him as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to lead a defender" is so terrible that I'm caught up in the fact that I'm genuinely surprised when I see that our attacker has been able to win one player of the opponent.
First Owners
Covid’s pandemic slows down, but experts do not expect a major reversal for the next few weeks.
The effort in hospitals according to statistical models will continue for some time, and the pandemic equation has arrived, as is known, with a new unknown variant of omicrons, which is more likely to spread faster than the present dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause more serious progress, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from previous recovery of the disease helps against it.
But this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covidal equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be complemented by Paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of as much as 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavir pandemic, also raised the question of how the administration is prepared for the incoming medicines.
As has been said, the first to reach patients in the country will be molnupiravir Merck.
The company ended up on tape as well as because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic broke out in order to find appropriate treatment for viral horse diseases in the South American continent.
In this research it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
However, Eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are used to saying "as our beak has grown".
See, you'll do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and they choose sides as AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and media lynch.
Then in the polls it looks nice, west good, east bad.
But they're really gonna find out what people are thinking.
It's only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, they both have over 20% of the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
It's identical because of the shooting of the troops so that the soldiers don't have to learn where it is again, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Hill and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the sssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either because of safety or the speed of headsetting due to the westerner position.
In these underground covers (there are two in each maple) only the heads were stored, not the whole rocket as they say.
If it was necessary to put this gun on, a special unit came in and picked up this head and mounted it on some stretcher.
Besides the museum maple, they're left in dissolute condition.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate, Gypsies, and we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he used to show too much, but he was such a mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went out and wanted to explain something, lacked a little, walked regularly, took sport with us, didn't steal snacks, didn't steal phones, walked cleanly.
He also went to schools in nature, he did all sorts of monkey shops, but he was fine, I guess he was never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, there were siblings, Gypsies in the same year, other class.
In short, they beat up a teacher, they often dealt with police issues, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sell something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I sell it to Gypsies, they always have money, they don't try to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called in a month, said he'd already changed it to himself.
I say to myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they do in a decent society (work, work, work, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, he stretches his hand, he's out of apartments and houses, he's got a mess around him, he's making trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he's got, but I don't mind.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, they start doing business, working, learning language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatika
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, the right speaker of South Bohemian health workers, said.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old vehicle driver of the brand Peugeot was probably heading in the direction of the village of Žihovec to the village of Bavaria and from the undiscovered causes drove in the direction of the opposite direction.
After the collision with Škoda Octavia, the vehicle Peugeot ended on the roof outside the car, describing the accident of the South Bohemian police spokesman Štěpánka Schwarz.
The young driver of Peugeot suffered a very serious injury during the accident.
It was multiple injuries and remained in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition was transported by air from the Czech-Budjevo hospital, according to paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a slight chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, often not provided by customers
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad and several times a month.
He's mostly getting his pick-up cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher where it still pays to be imported, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector draws closer.
Since October, small consignments have been slightly auctioned, VAT has to be added and the mail is to be sent to the customs office.
He gets an e-mail saying that the customs are expecting a package.
If VAT has not already been included by the trader on sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount per consignment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also include the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna call in one or two break-ins, I'm gonna put in two annexes, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments, however, are able to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad from 60,000 to 15,000 fell to international mail in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the calls for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments in international mail that we need to process.
If people filled out all the data they need and would fill it in in time, we would be here in about half, says Czech postal spokesman Matáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think this growth should do to slow down or compensate?
In Poland, for example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this your way?
What do you think will happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business that I do when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven offenders send themselves behind bars for, like, six months?
This just doesn't bother me how a court can only send an animal like that behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to his/her victim being traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention, the rape victim never needs to recover from it again.
Doesn't that mean a potential future report of rape of the victims?
The man from the grave "smacked" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave reluctantly helped the officers to secure his country-wide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them himself.
But he's gone off the rails.
First he called a stranger and made up a story about being robbed.
After the call to the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “stolen” told them that he had made it all up so that the officers would arrive.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how he was going to report to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and was ordered to be arrested.
The case therefore resolves the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slovak?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally long ago, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the memo, of course, that Churchill failed to secure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavonic language.
Well, I don't know, the question is, can a rational person really believe anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit?
I wouldn't consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about 10,000 different religions.
Which God or Gods should then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you unbelievably if you believe in another god.
But even in the desert it is said that there is no god but the LORD.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing from those thousands of gods the wrong way and the one true god I just didn't hit will send me to hell for it or some other place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent placement in reserves.
The Swiss model is kind of similar.
X months of training (in various specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person is doing well, he can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: There is a constant misunderstanding of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a permeability in which the labour force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar spillovers should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or perhaps a Mongolian invader will never break in here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved into stone, we have allies, and so they'll defend us if there's trouble.
Well, you're welcome, man.
There's only one election in the U.S. to round up their budget and NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown themselves to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military technique of their times.
And today, he can fly remote controlled assets every teenager, so what can't be done.
We don't need a border fortification, that's fart today, but a screwed-up teenager behind a remote-controlled device book will handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You're gonna unpack your presents under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden, you're in the house with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is used again by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops has been created that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring them to a connected store (the KAMSNIM.cz project map contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has been sold 50 % over the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and the complete material in Popovek near Brno are shared by individuals at home, but we are also contacted by companies with which we have arranged regular shipments of deferred cartons.
We'll use everything in packing our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together form a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for generations to come, says Petra Lopushníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only the pick-up points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine, if you need anything to get rid of (where to take the diluted household waste, where to deliver the past medicines, tyres, used electricity, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and other useful things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such sites.
“The collection courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste,” adds Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the application from the company Clean up the Czech Republic.
It seems more wrong to me that today's technology is so simple and stupid that kids who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they won't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English) that high school students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying file system with the files and everything uploads on one screen in the application.
They can use technology from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he revealed the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be reached in six months.
French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters of the gap between the right and the left agree on a little, but it is true in Europe.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to the criticism that Macron was talking about pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it's more like rewriting history to defend it.
The far right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now driving France with the fact that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously, and let's not look at what's going on in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs, they find out who they beat in what battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened chancellor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.

Trains are starting to ride according to the new timetable, and the carriers are changing somewhere.
Since Sunday, trains have begun to ride on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain tracks, for example between Ústí nad Labe and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to ride instead of Czech roads.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, if any, and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The ticket sales started in the fall.
Czech roads plan to travel daily on average 6783 passenger transport connections in the new timetable, with an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel about 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national connections, the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will ride on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be shipped by the carrier to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase driving prices by 3.2 per cent on average from next year.
Roads take account of inflation in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the driving order of the RegionJet is access to the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín line.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will be making 16 connections on the track, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havlíčkův Brod, Ždár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained his 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedlarík, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains despite planned exclusion work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
The changes await passengers, for example, to Czechoslovakia, where the trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will take place on the track from Mladá Boleslav via the Czech Republic to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform railway ride in the second year.
As with the Czech roads, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning the look of the other side?
We can hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to wail, how they died.
In my life, I've never heard a slave party lecture or since, no one defends it, they just condemn it.
No one will ever tell you in school that black people often sold black themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they'll tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, yet they killed each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, right in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't met someone who deliberately silenced the facts, but I've heard it happen before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (maybe there are atrocities in Japan from WW2 quite a taboo).
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just what it's like, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, while we're already in those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some of their good successes and I find it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North has not been much better, as many people today idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, deliberately missing some facts, lying and manipulating, and maybe our view doesn't exist with them (there was a video on YT from the TV where they leaked someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found funny in U.S. schools was the rise in Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities it was shocking, those students were radicalized enough, and those schools supported them so many times.
And when I imagine these people getting a lot older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because it's between the young and the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long been achieved by what he had and is no longer about the same thing, he has been radicalized.
At present, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other hand, where this often leads to resistance even on pretty reasonable matters.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more it's to hear.
Anyway, in conclusion, I've never met anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
More like I met the wrong geography, but that was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, the concept of nationality is generally considered unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something is so important to me with people, the world's views and experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always screws up some chicken about the coronavir that everyone's ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Church is Czechoslovak.
They are officially Protestants, but in fact they were born from a Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services to geese because it's theoretically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise St. Michael's church at the Dominican Square belongs under the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3 p.m. they do Mass in Latin as it did before the Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronary pandemic, but this morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal–Břeclav border crossing.
He was taken over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we share with the department each year, and I look forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, she told the present journalist Amalia Budíková.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes about the shipment of the flame across the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally took the train to Brno, where they would hand it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday 18 December, the scout couriers who will travel the selected speedboats and personal trains will take care of the light.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light to the stations, who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's happening just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear robes, to try to keep their distances, to sing as little as possible colleagues, to simply behave as safely as possible, described by the speaker of the Bethlehem Light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is for a believer a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of vanity and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.Bellemskevesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that the subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think a grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make the right use of the money, except I don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned above - a useless product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where there are a million "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company holds on and collects contracts/employees to companies that could grow after it's gone and be more productive
Total consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in Internet times will also be caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think Internet advertising is moving with me, but then I'm going to find out that I've been affected, too - it's just so twisted that you don't always fight it.
I therefore support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all bullshit, classic words - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most believe and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television's down the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred premieres this year.
Los Angeles – China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English - speaking countries have lost their trend in Christmas films, and this year they will be presented to their viewers in the premiere with record of more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience's ratings, so these images are becoming more and more.
This year four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be really holiday films much more.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period, world-wide popular pictures are also at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The right boom of the Christmas pictures, however, started only in 2009, when a special film series came along with the American cable TV station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began its viewers on Christmas Eve on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime's competitive station has 35 new films with Christmas theme on the program this year, and they also contribute to the overall sum of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
“In this magical period the story doesn’t matter as much as it does, it’s important that there’s a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it’s snowing,” said this genre by Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas films called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For viewers it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the middle of all this holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have lived for the last few years," Gray added.
For example, he says that Hallmark uses the same recipe that is uniform but successful for its films.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's about a half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that's going to work out nicely, and the two of them are going to kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, the final F1 race will not hit.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Grand Price of Abu Kill in formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and until the last race of the season will not hit.
Staj Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th pole he took off in qualifications.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not eventually hit the Grand Price of Abu Killi.
Because he was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grill, and Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will compete with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle for the title.
Mazepin, according to Haas, is relatively fine and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now it is in isolation and the guidelines of the competent public health authorities will be followed, with security being the final priority for all parties involved," her representatives for formula1.com said.
He can't even send a replacement rider to Haas.
A possible replacement would have to undergo qualifications or driving on another part of the weekend.
Covido-19 is not the first racer to compete with.
At the start of the final season there was covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were tested positively by Sergio Pérez č Lewis Hamilton.
They can put you in jail for this, too.
And everyone's gonna care if the boss says so.
From the point of view of the law, there's a covid on the list of infectious diseases.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The prize of the most expensive sweater will impress!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, the sweaters never wore much at our house,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work six months in six months.
Silk bought in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarovski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk delivers the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as fast as possible,” admits Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it will create a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost “only” CZK 720 000.

The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Genists, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission has been approved for six months.
They should help Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the assistance of the NATO States, in connection with several months of ongoing actions by the Belarusian regime, which in its territory invites citizens of the Middle East countries with a false promise to easily cross the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already active in the Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation spreads south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another case of Adam's kid.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this option with another Adamov child from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Association is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the area in a week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the option in our six cases,” said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one Faculty Hospital Brno and two children from one of them, also two 11-year-old students from the Adamov University.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four symptoms.
No one suspected of Omicron traveling abroad
None of them traveled abroad or any of their families came into contact with anyone who lived abroad.
There is no connection with the water field championship in any of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief Health Officer Pavla Svrčinová earlier said that an international water polo tournament was being checked, which was in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the South African Republic, and a Belgian player became ill after returning.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas on a restraining order.
Governor Gavin News of California announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous American state by means of a legal mechanism that used Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of the heart rate of the embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
The announcement by Newsoma responded to the United States Supreme Court's Friday opinion, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, even though it was against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion flat throughout the United States until the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now ruled on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measures.
The enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public in this case, making it impossible for the Republic of Texas to attack it by ordinary judicial means.
“I was outraged by the decision of the United States Supreme Court yesterday (Friday) that allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and strongly supported the Texas manoeuvre to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
"If States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said he had his subordinates work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would justify a representative of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
These are marked by a homemade weapon which does not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim damages of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court costs of anyone who produces, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts to "arm spirits" or sets for their production.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrifying weapons off our streets is to create a threat to private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” the governor of California said.
AP notes that after decades California has banned the production and sale of some weapons of military style, but in June, a federal judge here has banned the ban as an anti-constitutional.
If the state would now actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayore, who, in an unconsenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognise full immunity from the judicial review by the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against the elected members of the southern state of the United States.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and there will also be improvements to the vaccine itself, based on results.
For example, in a large number of studies on the effects of 4 doses are already under way from Israel.
And according to these studies, the majority of patients have up to five times the increase in antibodies, which has already had a long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination, he'll have his vaccination schedule after time, only he's too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus that, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times the efficiency should be marketed in a short time.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, stopped the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the EU fund to restore the economies affected by covidu-19 pandemics.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism that allows the collection of EU subsidies to countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a close majority in the Symium.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified, given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish Minister added.
Its party in its approach to the EU takes a more radical stance than the ruling party's right and justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone for Ziobrov's actions threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and most Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, which would result in the limitation of the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of the colony," he said.
But to tell you the truth... there's a kind of cheese in Lidlu in four different places.
I didn't look at any of the other things. I also met a couple of times. All I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes at the milk racks, I gave up and I asked.
They had it, that's true, in the narrow sector, all the chosen, less common and special cheeses were, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If he avoids it, I don't even smell it anymore, actions of nonaction, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need, and it's in order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I'm going to Lidlo to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little more out of the box than most of the vaccine advocates.
Although there is a rational discussion at the professional level, only extreme views are available in the public space.
All the time from the wall to the wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Banning everything, allowing everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states, no one solves it.
Ugh, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the interruption and have a nice day for all of you.
When I was a kid, I was punished with a cook.
It was never because of the signs, it was mostly just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (I read instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a wound (sometimes even after another "bum" cook just brought it and laid it down so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I get a few butt wounds (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable terms and in measure) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than words.
In my opinion, the warning part is important because it gives the child in its own way a choice as to whether to listen and get it, or it improves and there is no punishment.
After all, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
When a significant Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalist’s question about what the Czech Constitution meant to him — whether they would consecrate a charter on which he swears and learns at school from time to time, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be amended if necessary, he was firmly attached to the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and change is better saved.
And imagine: Some peoples even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl then voted.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing number of opinions among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
Years are tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as the conduct of the elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
Among other things, the Constitution is a rule of government consisting of individual rules that set out the policies of mantinels of the game.
We fear that it will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politics to bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few months-old baby
Although it is known that the coronary virus is milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been facing most recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said New York City’s primary clinics of children’s anesthesiology and resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are ill with coronavir, which we see especially in the last period," said Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It's taking place at the clinics of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavir are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndrome were in the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now is the growth of children with acute covidal pneumonia, which means pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and a several-month-old baby.
In hospitals, children are also in severe condition due to coronavir.
"We currently have a child of several months of age and adolescents," the prime minister said.
He is pleased, however, that no child deaths have yet been reported on the coronary virus at the children’s hospital of FN Brno.
According to the available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in a children's hospital, not only in the Coronavir Department, he is an integral part of the collaboration of psychologists.
At the same time, it also points out that, as in adults and in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“That’s why the vaccine dose is recommended for children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They are seen on a tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not cross the fence into the barn).
Skiing/riding on a bicycle in a forest outside the marked road must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How's the conductor doing?
Music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He's disemboweled by a liberal opera and originally played on a forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all the repertoire, and as a conductor he acts not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Shaldy, but also in Pilsen, in the Theatre of Joseph Kayetán Tyl.
He works with the castle Philharmonic, with the film Philharmonic or the sub-Korkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China builds on the impression of the disease managed and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Synologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of the disease managed and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for not being able to stop the disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the infected.
The states, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aids and Chinese doctors are often helping to combat coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support, or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of his and says, "Hey, you don't want an elephant?"
I got him, and he's great.
The wife likes it because she saves grass, she washes the car with her boots, the kids play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want for 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend, let's give it a shot. It's gonna be great.
After a while, they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn's broken down, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's broken down, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says you're not talking about the elephant, you're not selling the elephant like this...
World events are dominated by power.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works for its integration.
It is currently operating at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it'll work.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in garlic, so maybe I'll say a word.
I just assume that ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and Mandarin" is no longer clear in Mandarins that they are from Spain.
In addition, I'm assuming that the phrase "all American forces" means including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, therefore, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and that it does not need to be specified further by the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a senseless request.
There was a five-degree earthquake in Tokyo.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Cosman Milly
Scary shots show the moment the frightened monkey shrunk in the toilet bowl before her insensitive owner flushed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its true nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate's Court has now banned her from animal breeding for life, reported The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of monkeys who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened alien before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating the Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing with another saved monkey named Moon again.
A four-time mother confessed to two charges of needless suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in the Guent Magistrate's Court with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-long ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12,000 crowns of legal costs.
Team leader Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She was squawking and hiding from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and she's happy with the male, she can still have a look at the new people.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's tyranny came out after the police in Gwent discovered the horrifying footage of her wife's phone after the robbery in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly giving vulgarly.
On the next video, you can hear Holland's monkey offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1,600 pounds (in the count of less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received parole for 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this age three times in a row when you bravely leap across the 20th century?
Like, in freshman year, you're gonna take the same stuff you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling when no one, the honor of exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
Just write the test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and ask people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even choke and tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want it and they don't need it.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get into it anyway.
Partly, it's taught for a lot of people who need what kind of thing they need.
But, like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff to stand by the machine, I meant it seriously because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly get to a time when not knowing is the mark of a punk.
(Which is probably also part of our communist past and anger against the educated and the elite) But the price of having the Barbarians stand for us with these machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists can count, there's probably no way they've ever reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The Kadri and Andrey War continues!
Which is the main reason why she cannot leave Switzerland immediately," Andrea replied on an Instagram in Storyia to all the questions of curious fans, which disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
It's been between Kadrim and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move behind her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic.
But she was absolutely refusing it.
And as you can see, not only did their relationship not end in love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect for each other until they hated each other.
It was a planned attack from you! he was angry with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty was no longer enjoyed by his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand by her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't express myself to such things at all, and we've never really said that much in the family.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who's trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most even though he was young.
I'm more sorry if I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite torn out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and our family, in a confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality, and we know how it really was, delivered it vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao started his robbery trip in a parking lot in a residential area where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually estranged less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he had no idea better than to climb up to the fifth floor and walk into the apartment with an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On a security camera shot, he gets caught walking off the street from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the landlord woke up this morning, he found out the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
Then Chaa kept it.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on a day of incrimination.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob intoxication.
The whole thing's under investigation.
The drunk crawled up the facade to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively bound to pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't work.
Although the law restricts the scope of business
Is that not good enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but not abolished.

Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think that's all people write you here know.
You're just playing dumb so you can fight with someone.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was ultimately a goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don't care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had buried, how much science was suppressed, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-olds.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was affected by rescue workers in the district’s Medical Rescue Service.
Employees of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight a distress call with initial information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews immediately left for the site – medical and medical.
After arriving at the scene, the paramedics found that a 17 - year - old man was supposed to fall from a window about 12 meters high and hit his head on concrete!
There was coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should be, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries, and in direct danger of life.
The intervention doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and, following other measures under pre-disposal immediate care, his ambulance moved him to another care centre of the island trauma center, informed the speaker of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have more concerns than I have with coronavir from inadequate public and government responses
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease lies mainly with doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking the military doctor David the Ripper.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA has had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Penjová has been able to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who has not found a conqueror in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, presented a great contraction against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly trashed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one expected.
That's what brought the women's bantam weight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as a supposed “dwarf, ” Nunes not losing for seven years and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to win very actively, and the opponent even gave her the push kick she sent her to the ground.
But Pena did not make any further mistakes, and she failed to attack herself by using a lever on her arm.
The second round was breaking and the MMA fans were very tense.
Both rivals had many excellent blows and hard hooks.
Plus, Nunes got her on the ground where she started squeezing her.
She had to give up her efforts, and then she went off.
An American woman so prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliver and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
At first, though, Poirier was better off, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active in Oliveira, who tried to kill his opponent with a lever on his arm.
Although he did not do so much, he then created great pressure, got a rival on his back, and put a number of wounds on him.
That's why the second round won.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, to which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to recoil.
The Brazilian so defended the title, Poirot lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, the sovereign triumph of Raulian Paiva, had already placed a hard right rear on Raulian Paiva.
Then he received it with a number of exact strokes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most essential names in Czech speak only one grammatical family, so it is not difficult for them to determine whether they are male, female, or middle.
But then there is also a relatively numerous group of significant names in which the family is not stable.
Such important names vary between two generations.
When leaning, they acquire double limbs and in some cases remain in an unfavorable form.
For example, the words “wist ” or“ hip ” are the kind of man and woman, in which they first bend according to the pattern “machines, ” in the second, according to the pattern “song. ”
For the other group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of a single number, such as ‘row/row’, ‘kedluben/kedlubna’ or ‘bream/bream’ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example, "ocureka" in the Czech Republic and "ocurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is inconspicuous, similar to the other Czech-moral two words: "kop" and "kopa", "kopa", "kobla" and "koblih" etc.
Some of the words that entered Czech from other languages were originally inadvertent, but they gradually take over Czech limbs.
A typical example is the expression “image”, which is the kind of male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained unfavorable in the Middle Ages, but in the male race it has ends according to the model “garden”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to publish themselves to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising Greek support, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to travel in uncertainty?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months, and we've been suffocating, reports a reporter from Sydney.
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities there and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent drastic effects from being ruled by critics?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a reporter from Sydney Iko Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone's always written all over the place.
It's uncomfortable for people to figure out what sexual violence looks like in our society, and how widespread it is, so they're trying to order it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how often their neighborhood or the police treat these people.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people to himself.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting to spit in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "most of the charges are made up" and that it's "trend" you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods divided houses, families have no money to finish
The prices of construction material have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a tough situation for that.
It does not have the means to complete its house and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already divided family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
Better yet, people are moving into scattered and unfrozen homes.
In worse cases the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and to pay rent for it," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has been betrayed.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivonj.
A lot of people are just gonna have financial problems.
If they're counting on the house building to go up to five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
The material is the most irresistible of copper, iron, as well as installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also struggling with labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation with regard to the issue of the building permit is more favourable.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," said Kreček.
We're good, and we're gonna have a better time.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO – myRozvos
In addition to classical celebrations, the introduction to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year they spoke to the people, except the Prime Minister and President Andrej Babiš and President Milos Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Parliament.
What did we learn?
As in that I find my diploma super right now, I have my own theme that I've chosen, I'm applying to a cod, I'm always working on it all year, and then in a week or two, I'm going to write a written part.
The station is completely quiet, if the man is not a total poppy and he has something left in his head, the committee won't strangle him unnecessarily on the theory.
I might have been studying for a week at the State Department, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to get me to do some logical driving, which I immediately liked and I had it right.
Otherwise, on these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project to them (we've done it many times, really beneficial, they'll learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're cared for.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test to illustrate the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't swallow e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just as much a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can build a statue like Putin next to the statue of Pooh bear.
You need to put it on your ass to get Xi Jinping on your ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artist's stakes at his feet.
Once every day you don't give stories and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, it changes what function is more important if you like, comment or save.
I've had a lot of shit lately, so I might have to cut to the tictock, where a lot of artists in my industry have been successful and they don't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-hot that doesn't suck up to artists all the creativity and energy.
Declaration by the Donbase Party
The union – yes, the break-up – no, they express their opinion in the picture against the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šušekevič, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open-minded position of Mikhail S. Gorbačov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that ‘the SSR Alliance as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist’.
One stroke of the pens has “rescinded” a vast land with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The collapse of the USSR has left tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens abroad.
Since the early 1990 ’ s, Russia’s population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the negro population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built in the previous 70 years for one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They have, of course, deindustrialized, halted agriculture, removed from the world's greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically integrated into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poverty of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the military, the rise in crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet area, the series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that has been betrayed and given up in haste has quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a wholesale supermarket does not have to directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy this meat on Monday, will the chain drop to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism that will make it difficult for my system of experience to change its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and this meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This nonsense about that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or inquality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I've just gone to Brno to head and in the driveway, the misses were handing out a brochure, and I'm always taking things like that to help the brigades, and they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of rural reason and conservative views of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be such an agita.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually it came out of scientology.
Well, like a good nut, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, that's why the forest wouldn't have to roll.
I've had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail force you to please this person because you like him without realizing how much the situation is in the [bleep] part.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year ago it was a great relationship but then it ran for another six months and she started shoving on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with her and told her I was breaking up and lied to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get another amok.
Such a person will suck out feelings, emotions, and total joy.
You'd better keep your distance.
When insurance companies are fiercely looting through the purchase of a cloud of tests and the pursuit of positive ones who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
The only thing we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator dropped five days of home prison.
In the West, they've already stopped this mess and admitted that it's no use to solve a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new, and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by making up craps.
I see we're getting a good old bastard back.
After several years of silence and suppression of this negligent business, MLM recruitment is back on the emissary.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at V.S.), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly switched to "you don't need to be interested, especially people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and talk.
When the first earned money arrived, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make a living, he had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, or one felt like a suspected pot seller.
But what I can tell you is that it was a valuable experience, and one learned not to jump right on top of every peak and to scrutinize the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even useful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't been to a corporation where I do that much.
HR is calm, managers are looking for their management, and they're not sticking much in our noses.
A regular evaluation is then going on, in the form that it is going on with us (set some goals for the next year, in a year, we will see what is going on and what is not) - it is more a self-assessment than someone to evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But even within our company, we're a little bit evasive -- there are departments that are more "corporative."
Sometimes people feel like we're some kind of almost-startup who squats in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't work that way, as long as it's the results.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Nearly ten days British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced to James Kulhanek on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištsk had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that she had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In view of the family, we will not be sharing more information on the case.
I'm sorry, Kulhanek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the 28th of November on the bus on her way out of work, and she had to pick up money from the ATM before the show.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues at work five days later.
Then the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
The police in this connection detained a man a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case, and what he suspected, but didn't publish.
In four municipalities, by the end of the year, new representatives had been appointed
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Komňa, Uherskohradištišče, Lužice on Mosteck, Nova Ves on Liberec and Ravná on Pelhřimovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
Election participation reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Ravná, where 93.62% of eligible voters were elected.
The mandate was given to 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for the new elections to the representations in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in 28 positions of representation.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically closes a relatively challenging but successful year.
There were four or more new or repeated elections to the general offices and, above all, the very monitored elections to the House of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday December 12th at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we had a very dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without any major convulsions.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population is on all its layers, that's what I'm having a problem with right now.
I look forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He'd be relieved of his presidency and his ability to acquire it again.
The chance that this is really going to happen is, however, how others here mention very little.
Besides, I'm not sure if a file that's been mapped could ever be considered treason.
Versatile is an act that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight percent to 21 percent.
A woman between the ages of 18 and 35 who said that she had not had sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronary pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
However, the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, only 5% of them said that they were sexless in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people view premarital sex as dividing, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are minor, but their behaviour shifts this trend," Stone says about the 30 per cent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, religious establishment is the reason.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has risen from 20 to almost 60 % in single people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus replacing this need.
This trend was mainly found behind the lockdown during the coronary pandemic.
The whole ordering of vaccination against cod is about whether a society should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want, but that can save their lives.
This is a relatively difficult question that I personally have the greatest interest in the issue of social conscience.
For example, the question of if we don't order them to die is our fault.
My argument is that we could be sure about the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't give in and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can, for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who is here on the side of the SPD and the KSC, shouting something about a bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unanticipated pensioners are likely to belong to the other group, so they will indeed be able to do so themselves.
Czecho without snow.
How does a mild winter sign for the fight against drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls of recent times.
Operators of ski resorts will not be able to avoid technical snow, and the weather will also complicate the preparation of the jock Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight the drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have a story, but it's not about a girl.
Once in high school, our teacher took us all over the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride along the river.
On the way there we went one of these pretty wide streets and we don't see anyone in the middle - the resistance of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell for us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she was telling them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
It's not that big a deal, but the system's already collapsing, says Orozovich.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honor.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of the Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is, according to the Chancellor, the West to deal with diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normand Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor of the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts at (illegal) border crossing.
He discussed with the Chancellor further sanctions to make sure that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured Warsaw that it was in dispute with Belarus that it enjoyed German support and condemned Lukashenko's inhumane treatment of the refugee regime.
A drunk Polish car accident, trying to keep it a secret.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was driving and tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license if she didn't take the lead on the drive and get out of the scene, she came out with the truth, she said TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had stumbled into the vehicle and asked for her help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to respiratory tests, and immediately after they found out that she had a driver's license in her blood for over two minutes, they took her license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo's dog is doing the best he can.
Juraj Šajmovich did not watch his film.
Czech family comedians have seen in American stories about cute dogs.
But they forgot about the important thing: the legality of the film business.
After the feisty film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, we are now looking after the audience's emotions in the cinemas.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene comes the talking badger Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the forest pension that shrinks, will start inviting the sandmen, Julie's father and his partner and her daughter, Veronica, in particular.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a teenage girl who's having her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) have been confronted with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog picture, but they entertained at least children and dogs.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that causes a mixture of wonder and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's get this over with.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the desire for dark delusions after the child, and if the right “constellation” comes along with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined — on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing field trip with a local guide), the well-deserved Colonel Mojmír will shoot his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, where the family is taken away from the hospital so that in the heart of the noise loneliness, a miraculous process of curing dogs can take place.
Nothing against the pure treatment of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer marvels at the content of the diaper filled with incredible situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two robbers from the staff, a pedigree competition, a beaver charlatan, policemen coming to the show to look for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing strength of bone flour – which, of course, burns the family in the pension.
When a hero wakes up after a heavy coma and sits back on the ground with a cigarette at the family table and demands his father's whiskey and flak like a cured vegetarian, he can't laugh.
On top of that, the viewers will explain that “it sometimes happens after a coma. ”
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramatic knowledge of the work with text, the ability to put forward situations, the sense of character and point characteristics and the directional leadership.
Heroic performances are uneven, cut helpless and overall impression suffered.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová tries to stand up, they don't have much to play.
The only pillar of the film remains the poetic images of the forest nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and the two damsmen.
It is not enough to plan several characters, a chaotic plot, and dog reports, including the more vulgar expressions of the people that are allowed by the characters.
The argument is not even an old member of the Badgers' Club - as in the case of the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must be knowledge of craftsmanship if one wants to tell a convincing story.
That didn't work in this case.
For a good family photo, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feelings for genres.
Not even as a canist therapy commercial would pass this amateurly understood piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant bullying just like you do.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how shit you understand, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to a kid like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case it's a profit brigade.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry moons.
Winter is the only time in the year it rains.
"The total absence of precipitation during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli weather service confirmed.
For example, the village of Kfar Gilad in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term precipitation average as November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the right Christmas scene, he was looking forward to the population of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
The contractions in Israel come almost exclusively in winter months, are striking and irregular.
There are dependent forests in the winter rains.
Without them, they're dry and prone to fire.
It's not just the woods, it's also the drinking water supply and the moisture for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, this spring has filled itself with the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
The plumbers warned against drying long ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, a collision may occur here," the Israeli Water Authority spokeswoman Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as the desalination or recycling of waste water.
Worse are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital city of Jordan, Amman, tanker cars are arriving.
Waters and private wells dry up.
"This year, orders increased by 70 per cent to 80 per cent compared to the previous two years," tank driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
In Iran’s Isphahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The trough of the local river was completely waterless.
The region has had the driest November in years.
Israel Prepares Military Attack against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister declared that the Vienna talks had not made “no progress ” and had informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, says Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military training.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress ” and world powers“ to the knowledge that the Iranians are messing with them. ”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I was grilling the missus a little bit and grilling during the interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these pranks, I've been asking the miss for a while now with doubts and questions, and I finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a bum, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekends, waiting for them enough snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first greater effort of skiers about this weekend.
After a good snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have thus begun operation.
The climber was not even encouraged by the obligation to prove itself to the trains by means of a covidal certificate.
While drivers do not complain about customer involvement, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the province of Liberec took a weekend to track down and take the slopes.
Skiers wanted the weather that the sun and excellent snow conditions offered today.
"We are pleased that the opening weekend has indeed come out since Friday evening skiing when we had our first skier on the hill," sports space director Ještěd Jakub Hanuš commended.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to Jesenicki.
Ski Arena Karlovy or the centre in Branna na Šumpersk were opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save praise from the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Walk.
Skiers can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are within a period of time after the treatment of covid-19.
In addition to the exceptions people are prepared to do so and prove the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hronez from the Ski Centre Spindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Fewer interest than the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there's an interest in renting skis.
It's not like last year, but there's still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Oval Shop Skiopava.
More effort is expected during the ski courses.
He also feels that snowbear David Shinták is not as interested in renting ski equipment because of covid.
This time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
According to him, the pandemic lazyd and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental company in Novako on God’s Gift.
Ski rental started there a week ago, and the applicants have to order them in advance.
"We start renting this weekend running, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, as we did last year," said Pavlín Nováková.
The interest comparable to the pre-infection period is also considered by the ski school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, there must be a chance to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to get a dentist or a specialist’s doctor.
There's smart and smart people going abroad who don't have any assets.
The owner of the company isn't really gonna go abroad.
But with the rest of it, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Immigration from Hungary began by winning Orbán one beautiful day, ruling the year, and suddenly annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election at all.
If it's stupid to live here, some traditional V4 nut can win too.
The young and educated will leave, remain his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on the plane.
That's a scary photo!
Langmeier in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the team of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
On social media, the actor published a bloodshot of his face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a painting for the shooting?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a Saturday video where Srnc worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and in short she wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her associates.
According to the British media, Srnc was an assistant nurse at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petru, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter report.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.
Parliamentary Harriet Harman, who warned on Saturday about the Srncová case at the press conference, also calls on the public to cooperate.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course worried to death," said Labour political, holding in her hand a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
The police had previously detained a man in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information on his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approx. 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
That's not a giant amount, that's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of the invasion is magnified and begins to have our entrance full of teeth.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made him think Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a joke and Russia has GDP Italy.
Compared to the situation in 38 is out in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that with the first Spanish war and the "anexia" sicily :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine has announced that it is not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is implementing these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's how the "concentration" at the border would fit.
What, pacta sunt servanda...
New driving schedules have been in place in Prague since Sunday, mainly with suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, which relate in particular to suburban connections.
New lines have arisen, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavska is newly involved in the integrated system.
From Sunday onwards, the main city has stopped speedboats from České Budějovice in the station Garden City.
In the suburban train transport, the S7 trains will take the route from Beroun to the Czech Brod.
In the recently operated station Prague-Garden Town will be newly stopped by the R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will expand to other areas.
Among other things, they will take buses all the way to Svetlá nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Old rafts and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslavska will be included, including routes with access to Liberec and Kralovéhradecký Region.
77 lines will be removed from integration, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 will be adjusted to operate.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go all the way to Zatce.
There was also a new direct link Prague – Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be sent in the morning peak and the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will be launched.
The new PID system includes 400 and 410 links to the Liberec Region.
They're coming from the Střežkov Metro Station, not from the Holesovice Station.
The 400 spine line goes through Mělník, Dubo and Czech Lip to New Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Zvikov.
The 410 additional line goes through Mělník and Dubu to Doks, Mimona and Jablonní in Podještědě.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rozmital under Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of railways, long-term restrictions continue on the tracks of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
The buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobřeš with the origin of Prague, where it is possible to use the PID tickets to Milevska.
Routes 540 to 543 in Nymbursk were changed and some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Horovick in the Plzeň region were adapted.
Healthy snack/dinner at the supermarket office
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only way to get food is to go to Billy's next door or to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement after work, I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and dietful as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy pizza jams and yogurt and apples at a speed.
Question: What health without the need for heat treatment would you recommend that I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If destroyed, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to go off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of the gift of a relationship with the bear: I was not looking forward to this at all
The Czech show business pond has been living since Friday nothing but the discovery of the relationship between Dara Rollins and Paul Nedděda.
They've been pulling it together for years, and a famous football player has even gotten divorced because of a singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she had kept love from them for six months.
"I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed Dara caught a bear, then I'm sorry, Nedveda," jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care at all and jump out at them and out of the cans, or us whose lives are being spent in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your spouse are getting along well or insisting that everyone really knows the list of your ex-partners and they're familiar with your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a jug, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
Two of them went together in Italy, where Rollins was riding for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
He's been there for a long time as vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They only went out with the truth now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to end.
Ivan's wife and I have been separated for three years, and they're not married, but they've only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish it.
We're just people, we have families, we have children, we have past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new husband, and like him with me, I stand by him.
Hi, the other commentators probably already said everything important, but I'm just confirming that colleges are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and mated during the first semester or two, and then they found a place to stay, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't usually advertise too long ahead, so now you probably won't find much, but looking at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise definitely avoid not only Cejlu, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenic are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveri district is very student, the King's Field and in that direction it is fine, and it is also close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never sought a lease, but I'm a born Brno, so I can consult Brno as such if you still lacked any information :)
But this is an example of "normal" thinking.
Because of what some doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not finance some schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or they go according to state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education simply because a few crowns will be added to a full state contribution and will be able to teach him what he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost on weight when written by a person who, two days earlier, has expressed himself this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against anyone going to the abortion is the same for you as the voice against a statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloguing/digitalization that (and even long-term professionals) it will either somehow throw it away from the eye, or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (under the convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd have dealt with it in some way in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and hard-working student, you can look at some character databases and look for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would have guessed that the author or the printer simply created his own character, which fits into what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn’t it more of the Odry Empire (Kingdom) than the OdryNska?
PSS: Someone's already broken it down for you.
Take a look at this comment.
The politicians have no idea what will be the theme of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined by word of mouth, and some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more appropriate for politicians to have informal contacts, to establish superstandard relationships.
In addition, with this English, it is quite interesting, after a gig by the KGB from the EU.
I don't get the hat on Cail.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10:00 p.m. and never any problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't been there in his life.
Yeah, there's probably most of the Roma population in Brno, but the only thing they're doing is blocking the sidewalk and parking where they don't have :D is definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street tonight.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd be happy to go into it.
There's a lot of apartments there now that are newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's she spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the adventure wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovaks didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to burn.
I saw the wreath, and Lucie certainly has one, said the saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visited her.
He's visiting, but he doesn't live in their house in the Vineyards, where Dada is left alone after his departure.
The word still doesn't know where he'll be at Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN SEX!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN SEX!
But we were always talking, so Christmas didn't work out.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to have fun with, says the Slovak who was glad to meet the wife of Man Sobota Adrian or the singer Camila Nyvlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford without soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so will you explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be put in a crisis in hospitals.
The police are few and cannot afford it, so are the firefighters and nowhere else a high percentage of the well-trained people are at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the previous governments, not the army, it's been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have been left in mountain and submountain areas, and a smaller amount of precipitation has also been recorded in places where there has not been an emergency for moisture.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage land.
What is to be prepared for with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I'm barely gonna stick to ice skates, mushrooms know what it's like to play hockey, and that tactic (what I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also total chaos.
And whether you're a hockey team of "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" you lose two goals even if you don't have to win the game at any cost it's different than when it's compared.
But either way, as I listen to the Czech commentators who extort, what the referees do not notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and Italian actors, or motorcyclesport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like it's always the other way around, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than won, it'd probably be a classic "they've lost" with "we've won".
Coronavirus: Number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
In total, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 to 100,000, 871 to 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain faces the "inevitable" wave of diseases caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Authority, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
So far, no one has died at the omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the disease and about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer observed on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by having a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson’s government argued that the quiz had been made “virtually, ” via a computer.
However, he was involved in Downing Street groups of workers gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the prime minister's post is increasing.
During last December, when a tight lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized a large party despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were joking:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by a overwhelming majority in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the prime minister's post.
It's remarkable how fast events have developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections to end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much can you expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free because they weren't even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like anyone can actually vote where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is quite different.
It used to be about not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is for Victor Orbán and his side of the great aberration.
Won't they try to keep playing harder?
Yes, we have some indication that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, an independent media recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Lászlóa Kövér, explaining to the chiefs of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten up a lot, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, her dad has a long time, but then she blows up extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric, and I was angry as a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, it was about 2 times taken in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they would scratch my education, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a little girl, I was doing a bit of washing, now that I'm punching at something, and as a younger parent, maybe I've cried over my arm like that (so I don't get too much over my arm), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosive, but I'm sure this upbringing has a part to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids, too, and deal with it the same way.
I think beating children is just wrong and that my parents didn't have to do it, especially at a time when it wasn't “educational,” but because of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just shits something, it's probably not possible to waste their children, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me at all. I don't understand why the O.P. should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
So I would call the ones that make up the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of losing your income.
Can you really count on people wanting and buying a product and you will have what mortgage to pay for?
It's Coach's monster world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with a four-year-old defendant for the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kushnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She was promoting civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connection to Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention on a regular basis than the anti-five deans of all the medical faculties that went out a day or two later?
No, they got messed up, and the company bounced.
The Czech TV was dying with a codfish six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karl Havlíčk's proposal needs to be thoroughly reworked
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is at the end, and the law, which was to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in selecting and authorising the deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the years.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned associated with the Platform against the Deep Storage but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects the law to strengthen its ability to decide on the repository promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and requires the Czech atomic law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to work on the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karl Havlíčk, who has the Platform, refers in particular to the municipalities: The proposed rate of participation of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the location for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can be effective only if the community or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Management to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before a specific procedure is initiated.
The proposed proposal for a case-by-case plan almost completely ignores public participation and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in authorisation procedures.
The proposal lacks a system-wide compensation for municipalities for the entire search and selection process for storage, authorisation and operation.
In reality, the representatives of the municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend their citizens' interests in finding a place to store today.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or withdraw, but the Office or Minister shall decide in the interest of which authorisation is granted.
The case does not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-governments that the Platform requests is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in authorising the repository, as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is beyond the further failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which follows contracts with attorney Jane Zemánek.
The total amount of these works under the contract register is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, Mayor of the village of Cejle from the village of Hrádek and Speaker of the Platform against the Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who compared the position of self-government against the state authorities in seeking a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we expect a greater turn from the new government.
We're offering a helping hand.
We are also grateful for the support of the Union of Cities and Municipalities, which sees the issue of the insufficient rights of municipalities in such essential construction as the communities directly concerned in the selected locations.
The platform against deep storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 communities) in order to force a change in the state's access to nuclear fuel and other radioactive wastes, which will not be limited to a deep storage.
The Platform further urges that the decision to select a location for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman (69) made him lose his fear: he dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his life - style for many years, he was eventually intimidated by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing the furniture to burst.
“I pushed everything into my mouth,” said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, he said to ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's any text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was formal text and maybe university text, I would probably be looking for how to describe or explain the boss.
There's more than one kind of boss to everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses that yes, and so is a "boss" kind of like a master/governor of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who do not need to win at all to make the game or level complete, but often are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where are the bosses, but the player does not play directly with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and are they even called that?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It does not literally translate the boss in any way; the Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (it is interesting only the Catalan language which the boss translates as the final opponent).
It is in short for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent-stronger than all previous and watchful completion of any level or task.
He's looking for a missing Peter from London all over the world.
The Czech police are also involved.
The missing Peter Srncová has been wanted by the British police since 3 December.
The Czech police also took part in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradištsk has been looking for her since December 7th.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
The Czech Republic was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So he's looking for Peter all over the world.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokesman Kateřina Randlová confirmed.
"We share information on the case together," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it's 168 centimeters tall, it's thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She's supposed to come from Uherskohradištsk.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Mrs. Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She's involved in hanging flyers with Petra's face.
"We have great concerns about her," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it's not clear who he was and what he had in common with Peter.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the figures in October pointed to a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, with the coming end of the year, the attacks increased dramatically.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected Annex in the e-mail is intended to draw the user's attention to the name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the bill repair for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November have captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The form contained the most common .exe file extension, which was entitled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
An annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and suppression of activity have been reported by security analysts in the Fareit programme, which cost 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic has had no major attack campaign in recent months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The Prague route was bigger than the media said.
According to the footage of the tour along the coast and according to my experience, the protestor is not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the coast and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means there's a lot of people.
About 4,000 demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade.
I say something new is being born here, says Radek Mokry.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or segments of the population led to the finding of a common language.
Only anti-vaxers themselves, anti-rusters and the community could not fill or pay for such a great procession.
The events of the Dead Dog Association have a rising popularity, reminding me of a million moments for democracy at a time.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to tell what movement this discontent could make up for, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a quarter and more of a dose.
Definitely not a left-wing movement or a middle-class movement, bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine because it is obvious that we will have to be vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of the scientists that humanity is proud of.
End of the Pat, Bulgaria has a new prime minister reporting a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue to change, which won the November elections.
It has already been able to form a broad coalition government that should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the last government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost the election.
However, the winning parties reporting the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two early elections followed.

From the “secret” shots taken is a global hit.
In Britain, concerns increased over the fate of 32 - year - old Czech Republic, after which the London police had been searching for days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information on the employee of the children's hospital, she calls, apart from the police, her former employer or Member State representing the part of London where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a Saturday video where Srnc worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and in short she wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd by one of her associates.
According to the British media, Srnc was an assistant nurse at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petru, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter report.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.

In Ústí nad Labem a month hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole was further away.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RSD began to "integrate the situation".
