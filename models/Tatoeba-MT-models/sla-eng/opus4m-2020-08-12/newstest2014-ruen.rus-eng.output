In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, around 1-00, in the village of Lugovje, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He's known to have tried suicide before.
Which has led a man to such an unknown step.
On 31 October, between 11 and 50, a 41-year-old man, a Chinese man, was killed in his place of residence by hanging.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs' press service, Kinesemsky.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the decaying highway system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box carefully fitted to your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track and transmit every mile of road traffic to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated American highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the State.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning has given rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the Government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel, and even perhaps where you travel them, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
Chattering in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not waiting.
They are thinking about how, over the next decade, you can go to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking functions.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Government, who is preparing plans for the start of the monitoring by the state authorities of every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Fund, which is funded by taxes that Americans pay on autofuels.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gas prices.
“The tax on gasoline cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannić, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on vehicles to test the wrong payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term”, he said.
Boring calls it a wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as it will be possible to change the nature of road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions by means of taxes, for example.
Planning bodies in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious state laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of the Chamber ' s Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market in the Reason Foundation is also delighted to make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs of Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move towards a wrong payment.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to town.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is found in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of running instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
The I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 East Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor their every move.
“Anxiety about the “big brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the US Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states in which the search for low-cost technology is difficult to find, which would allow the state authorities to keep track of the mileage, but without information on the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of car insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of running.
But the devices that she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that's periodically loaded with a modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and track their location, ” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They may choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they could just give up the device and instead pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all state residents travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a guarded public, forcing devices to do more than less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxation device, which will also receive payment on parking counters, provide “payments as you drive” insurance and collect a real-time data pool from other drivers who could use it to avoid traffic jams.
“Cars will benefit from the benefits offered to them,” says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether all the misrepresentation of payment is simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for road construction by raising gas taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the commission on legislation and public relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to ensure that Ukraine has gas, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements about funding conditions.
It does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary for assistance and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one degree to “B” with “B”.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a spare option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
Maybe it'll be a North Stream gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most feasible and acceptable way in which Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and it is likely to reduce supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes,” said Reuters.
Russia outside the fight for urban pollution by car
Efforts to address the transport problems of large cities have been made in most of the world ' s megapolises since the second half of the twentieth century.
It was generally either redesign and expansion of motorways or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and their time of use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where there is a strict quota of private car growth and the right to purchase it is purchased at auctions.
Its price can double or triple the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only eco-class vehicles with high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” totalling about 250 billion Yuan in 2012 (about $40 billion).
As the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection, Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main objective of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and to increase not more than 5 per cent of fuel use per vehicle.
According to the Agency, transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the limitation of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, urban green five-year-old measures include the accelerated transition to euro fuel standards, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the establishment of encouraging financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official transport), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The road innovations of Beijing also include a ban on all private vehicles for traffic within the fifth transport ring (totally in the capital of the PRC of their six) one day per week (the corresponding information is contained in the registration number of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of lottery-based registration plates (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of licenses for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current State Environment Programme 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Mind Nature, in 2011, the “movable sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the city ' s atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial ones and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
In the RF, it is only now that the possibilities of restrictive driving in the streets of the cities begin to be considered.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are well unpopular and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters that are less sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal vehicles, as well as “privileged” vehicles with a total of not less than 200,000 (about 5% of Moscow ' s total fleet).
Urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study on the balance of urban areas between housing, road surfaces and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are: the city centre is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most of the drivers in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods in parking spaces or in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the traffic section (in order to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of passenger transport within the area of the protection zone of the historic centre (total territory of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Waldd will increase
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to keep the order in Vologda and clear the streets of natural tents and trays.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, and the products they produce often do not receive adequate sanitation.
This means that the health of the damper is under threat.
For example, the lower limit of the civil fine for unauthorized trade will increase six times from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles from November, reports the press service of the Voldá Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a non-payment crisis for unsecured consumer credits and massive employee cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption that is almost non-negotiable," said chief economist Goldman Sachs for Russia Clemens Graf, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of the Russian economy investor.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Graphe explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If she does not grow up, it could lead to dismissals and rising unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, says chief economist Barclays Capital of Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries to trick or retain current employees.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In Mr. Grafé ' s view, owing to the very high consumer borrowing rates, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy.
“We have not seen the benefits of the growth in the demand for credit, the money does not differ in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments”, the economist said.
But the problem is, in Goldman Sachs, there's an increase in default on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Grafé.
Therefore, the second threat of economic growth in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
Vassili Solodkov, Director of the Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the banks, were forced to attract high-interest funds from the population.
In response, the banks went out on the warpath and started to lower their credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the banks do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The loss of licenses by a number of banks in recent weeks is seen as a harbinger of mass collapse.
“The banks themselves will not succeed in this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis,” warns the head of the Institute.
But the growth in consumption will also slow down without the pay crisis, the investment is believed to be due to the failure to index the salaries of the public and the military in the current version of the draft budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs for natural monopolies (and consequently by the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if the investment does not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet - see the certificate), the increase in consumption will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantujshin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the preconditions for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in oil prices”, he said.
It is estimated that the Russian economy will begin to decline at a price below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB was not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that declared the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafke said.
The Centre ' s interest rate policy does not affect market rates; it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the CB, this is a failure of all hopes," Clemens Grafke said.
Money received from CB auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is down, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against ruble.
“The CB will sooner or later realize that this strategy is not working”, said Mr. Grafé, and recalled that the State is planning to launch a ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it would have to be done sooner, or raise the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to his assessment, the ruble rate is now artificially over 10 per cent.
There's only one way to go - to get weak - to find out.
But if the CB dives into financiers, at least the shadow of the doubt that the elimination of the monetary corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
The second South Ural Assembly took place in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The meeting was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, a total of about 350.
The Forum course is aimed at strengthening inter-national agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in full understanding," says Feofan, the Metropolitan of Chelyabin and Zlatoustowski.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the upbringing of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
Following the meeting, they adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national cultural associations in the Chelyabin region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. Intelligence Explorer, said that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German Deputy Hans-Christian Strøbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by the MP in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat it differently as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, said Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who heads the parliamentary intelligence group, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States entirely”, it should be used.
Mr. Strøbele, MP from the Green German party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strøbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “safe”, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — have found the disclosure of an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for the manual wager
Frontier Airlines plans to charge from passengers up to $100 for carrying a manual deposit on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 per handbag and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers could keep the entire bank.
The new hand-holding fee applies to bags in upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said he'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers paid only when they got on board.
A representative of the Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 bill should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airlines began to charge for the first and second bags packed in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges charge as much as they can, in the handholding placed in the upper baggage compartments, often lacking space in these compartments.
Collections are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new fee isn't really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier's most loyal clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the departure of the Frontier flight may be able to pass the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in a row can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change of procedures on the website and at Frontier's registration stand was intended to ensure that passengers knew about the fee before they got on board.
The new Frontier fee for the manual wager will not start until summer, although no date has yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of loss.
However, most of them were not concerned with the fees for hand-holding.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air computer followed suit.
The only other airline with this fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said an airline consultant named Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra fees.
According to his estimate in the December 2011 report, the fee for hand-holding is $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of the Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was curious to know that he would find out when passengers would encounter an unusual collection of Spirit for a handbag.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I had seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a cross between my teeth and a fight at the landing point.
The plane was captured, he said, “and the landing was rapid.”
Frontier is also followed by Spirit in respect of a $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that a share of coffee would be provided free of charge.
It will continue to provide free water.
The US Airways tried to charge for drinks in 2008 for a short time, but refused to do so seven months after the passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's manual fee initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last measure to attract customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket salesmen, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This allowed all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to go to the travel online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles to a frequent passenger who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of travel.
For example, a trip of 1,000 miles from Frontier, purchased by an online travel agency, would take 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only be selected in advance if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming lost.
The profit fell by 9 per cent and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to a financial result published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the airline.
The NSA blames "internal error" not hackers for shutting down the site
A covert national security agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their site for several hours caused a technical malfunction, not hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the break in operation was caused by a distributed attack of the type of “service failure” [DDoS] are not correct.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the ANB site had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA representative informed ABC News that the Agency's internal secret network “not at all” had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of hacker-activists stated that it was responsible for the withdrawal of the ANB site through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks have been designed to crush the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of order.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, once called No such Agency, has been at the centre of public attention and strong criticism in recent months, following a series of findings on its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of this reaction to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former member of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the Agency has led us to believe that today's incident was the result of targeted hacker action.
The arrival of Bombardier is declining with the drop in supplies and the number of orders per aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net profit due to reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier in Montreal also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its newest CSeries and did not provide new information as to whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation would be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced model aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, he flew only three more times, which raises questions as to whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results failed to justify the projections and led to a drop of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment Thursday from “high-market” to “medium-market” due to the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decrease in the number of air supplies was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the profits of the Transport Division,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders on CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first trial sample of an aircraft was submitted in March and for the first time flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are still not too much - 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of summer tests to check the company’s claims about fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would achieve his goal of 300 solid orders by the time the first plane was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the plane’s simple operation.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples should fly in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow him, according to the company.
However, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client will be able to operate CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the date of entry into service and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests — although apparently consistent with the Bombardier internal schedule — reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, the net income of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted share profit remained the same — 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly — from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had deployed 45 aircraft a quarter, which was less than 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The airline's portfolio of orders amounted to $32.9 billion for 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
“In the aviation field, the results were in line with our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor”, Boduan said.
Gross air revenue dropped by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector had increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion for 30 September, slightly above the 31 December level.
The revenue of the transport unit has had a negative impact on the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Google's chief financial director Patrick Picchett would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent — to C$ 4.83 in a bid in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
Japan's electronics producer, Sony, completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profit for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more devastating than expected due to the decline in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers for the production of the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, in the second quarter of the company’s first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, again fell to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially because of the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted the focus on industrial kits: the sales of companies are increasing at a high rate, especially through road systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony expects 179 billion yen of operating profits against the expected 230 billion yen earlier.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food ambulance.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from a Japanese corporation has been announced, with a number of fashion functions that will help rid itself of the need for 100 times a day to get a smartphone out of the pocket.
After Sony reduced her annual profit and profit forecast, the company's stock in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning to the opening of the tracks, down to 1,668 yen per share.
The gene of speech was a synapses promoter
Scientists at the University of John Hopkins and Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that enabled Foxp2’s speech gene to function by stimulating new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be found on the magazine’s website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by finding a family of several who were unable to speak correctly and sometimes even misunderstood each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions, Foxp2 acts as a catalyst for the development of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
He's doing this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found to be the result of a search for factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 is the only active one.
The fact that SRPX2 actually affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When the activity of the gene was artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when they were separated from the mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the produced sounds was also restored.
A link to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself was also shown on mice earlier.
Animals with a human copy of the gene fed more actively and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and its SRPX2 management are related to purely "mechanical" sounding properties or to thinner processes.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta leaked information to Neil Scarboro's criminal authority
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta referred classified information to Neil Scarborough's criminal authority on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who was called a “hot lawyer” among the criminals, was arrested at home in 2011 after a police operation to monitor Scarborough, which he had previously submitted to a drug court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough had left three packs of cocaine at the home of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at a bar dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly using” Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two persons on the orders of Scarboro and one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at that time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization dealing heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later imprisoned after the police seized £1.5 million of heroin and cocaine during a series of raids, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta reported to the criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, which works at the Forbes Solicitors legal firm in Blackburn, he was disgraced after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial before the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The disclosure of the lawyer took place after the police, investigating the activities of Scarborough, found that he had regularly spoken to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him coming to Ditta's house in Blackburn and putting drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under a lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after Skarbor's transmission, he called many times with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park Football Stadium in Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Ditta was “regularly using” cocaine after the tests found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to a suspected drug dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was “an attorney's secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to pull out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
During his interrogation with the police, he said that he had a home office, and his clients came to him on legal matters.
However, it was known to the court that, after important arrests, he had called the major drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Anne White said in the indictment: “If anyone even knows that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who's supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the lines of normal relations between a lawyer and a client.
He prevented police investigations as far as possible to allow those persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He became too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed himself to doubt his disinterest.
Ditta did not plead guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, to whom I am not, and I would like to convey information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do so immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he has begun to acquire drugs from organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main criminal groups that had instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditta's investigation was conducted by the Lancashire branch for a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine possession, and now to obstruct the administration of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let the case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt for conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons who participated in the machination were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On Ditta's website, he conducted a question-and-answer interview in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work was inequality.
The stadium in Jaroslavla is not ready for the reception of 22,000 viewers, according to police officers present at the KDC RFS meeting today.
The ticket programme has been overstated, in their view, approximately twice.
During the match 1/16, only a thousand stewards were involved in the Russian Cup with Spartacus, with a standard of 9,000.
Spartacus Hospitals had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but, as agreed with the Moscow Club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This was published by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigoriantz.
The Americans were listening to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the US special forces, who preferred not to reveal his name, said that the States had listened to the telephone calls of senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that there are several listening points in the country of the rising sun.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite its post-war alliances with Americans, are intelligence facilities, NHK reported.
None of the parties have yet formally commented on this information.
Remember, news of the U.S. special forces surveillance of the Chancellor of the FRG appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some figures, has heard a very painful report about her audition.
She stated that the allies she considered to be FRG and the United States for decades were unacceptable to such monitoring of the head of Government.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share the details of Angela Merkel's telephone interviews with the German prosecutor's office.
The German flew specifically to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Baskirija can place grain at the auction no sooner than early 2014.
Baskiriya can place grain on the market during public procurement interventions no sooner than early 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and there's demand.
“Possible grain will be auctioned after the New Year”, he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the 2013 crop crop crop was 3.1 million hectares this year, including 1.7 million hectares of grain, which is 3.3 per cent higher than last year.
Under the 2014 crop, 550 thousand hectares were sown (by 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticals has been increased, and the rose has remained at the same level.
There is no "Brother Circle" group in the U.S.
In the databases of the Russian forces of the "Brother Circle" group, to which Washington has included the singer Gregory Leps, it does not mean anything.
As noted by Interfax in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation, after media reports of the introduction by the U.S. Ministry of Finance of Gregory Lepsa into the checklists of suspicion of belonging to the Eurosian criminal syndicate, all databases have been checked, but no such groups have been found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is supposed to operate abroad, is considered in the power structures.
"Even in the very title 'Brother Circle', there's some element of secrecy, there's an indication on the secret bed.
"It's all very much like a pear action," said the agency's interlocutor.
On 31 October, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced that Arthur Badalian, Grigoria Lepsveridze, Vadim Lalina, Sergei Moskalenko, James Rybalski and Igor Schlykov were listed as belonging to the Eurosian Criminal Union.
Persons listed on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
Grigory Lepsa's production center refused to comment on the US allegations against the singer, calling them a "wreath".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Brotherly Circle union as “the major transnational organized criminal groups” and commissioned the mine to “substantiate and prevent their global criminal operations”.
The inclusion of a person in a black list of American minfin entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with persons residing in the States.
A scandalous video went to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and openly reckless ventures, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had an appropriate video record and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was charged for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising video by Rob Ford was found during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself is not commenting on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault and he's not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in a 35-year-old friend named Ford Alexander Lisi, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illicit income and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisi served as Rob Ford's driver.
The people of the city have long demanded their mayor's resignation.
He fought with journalists on many occasions, appeared in a drunken way in the audience, and allowed himself to speak racistly and sexually.
The OAO Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the project's designer.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the OAU press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition and, under the terms of the tender, the project was to be prepared and sent to the state experts in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport upgrades.
During the first phase of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 sq m and may then be increased.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the development prospects of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was concluded, the architectural concept of the South Air Station complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov Na Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E of Sheremetiev International Airport and a new airport complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The International Airport South will be built in the Aqsai region of Rostov and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and will be integrated into the urban structure in the future.
The start of the construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Turkey's politician declares hunger strike against Syrian border
In mid-October, authorities began building a separation wall in the Nusaybin area of south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish border town of Nusaibin Ayse Hekhan announced a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported to the Peace and Democracy Party (DPA) on Friday.
The police repeatedly staged protests.
Head Muammer Guler of Turkey denied the construction first, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Ayse Hekhan, a member of the PMD, declared hunger strike, thus turning her protest against building a wall into a deadly struggle," the party said in a press release.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree with”, the party's representatives are quoted as saying.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a currency exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolivarian currency, against the tourist dollar.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers are allowed to exchange an amount equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivarians acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the Bolivarian relative to the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 Bolivars per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivarians.
Since the beginning of the year, Bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and Vice-President for the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the Bolivar.
According to informal reports from the Agency, Caracas may nevertheless decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing prices for products and goods of high consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a number of shortages in goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
South Director Andrey Belmach noted that it was difficult to say yet how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation only took place a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - says Itar-TASS, Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
It's not just about finding a coach, it's about finding a guy who's gonna work in our club for a few years and get some results.
Kenyan press outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason for the question: What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the paper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Camau, director of the Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary “will always be biased because it is a continuation of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the Government to “take the media dead by grabbing”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been “stricken” and criticised the bill as “draconian”.
The bill is part of measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras where troops that were sent to the site of the attack allegedly looted a expensive shopping centre.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was the call of two journalists and a media officer for questioning, although the call was lifted following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million at additional risk of being “listed off”, i.e. banned from official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “lived blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media silent, they can do whatever they want without impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote a journalist, Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the reductions imposed by the National Wages Commission and restoring their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the monthly payment of the crows, which will be allocated to the major repairs of the house.
It is estimated that between 100 and 400 roubles a month will have to be paid for a standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year.
The exact norm will be determined by the Government of the region.
However, when you decorate the driveway, get the ladder cells in order, or even replace the elevator, the tenants themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by the members of the district pride.
Vladimir Klutnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: "In this case too, order - to set the order of the capremontation of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of State control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-family homes."
Under the control of the State, there is now a shareholding.
The law, which protects against fraud, has been approved by the inadvertentness of the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, four and a half thousand people were affected by dishonest builders.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in construction.
Vladimir Klutnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, stated: "It is not a secret that the same lengths have also begun in this area in the year 98."
People started making money to cover up the lasagna, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronege, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The District Parliament has adopted such legislation not only under pressure from the Federation.
The problems of illegal migrants in the region are at least averted.
Thus, in the past year, just over 100,000 foreigners have become involved in the migration record.
But only one in five made official work permits.
Where everyone else works and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klutnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: "They have broken the law but are not criminals."
There's no court, and we have to deport them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to provide such facilities through regional means.
In the Voronezh region, this place is defined as the Old Olshanka of the Semilouk region.
Finally, the regional parliament granted new benefits to many children ' s parents.
First, families where 5 or more children are raised are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case is $3.5 million, but the same is true of economics and many children ' s parents.
Secondly, most importantly, those who adopt the 3rd and the younger will be granted housing grants from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, of six people — a father, a mother, a mother, a child, and a third — adopted.
For them, according to the rules, the State acquires an area of 108 square metres for 3 million rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West Microregion, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the resort for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalia
The current Board of Directors of the OAU, Uralkalij, proposed the nomination of Director Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, to a new board, is reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner listed 11 persons nominated for the new Board of Directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will determine the new composition of the Board of Directors by a vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
During his detention in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, said that the charges against Baumgertner had been requalified as "theft".
Petty Officer Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's departure from the post of mentor of the lower classmen.
The Golkiper believes that the acting chief coach, Dmitri Balmin, enjoys great authority over the players and will carry out his duties.
Remember, today, Naphthechemist retired Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, quoted Dalton RIA News.
The only thing I can say is that Dmitri Balmin will handle the commitments he's made, I have no doubt.
He has great authority on the team, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to a great future.
Yuventus' protector Leonardo Bonucci won't help the team in the next match of Italy's Parma.
According to Italia Football, the coach headquarters decided not to include him in the game application to take over the 4th round of the League of Champions' group round with Real.
Nor will they take part in the match with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vukinić and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Qualarella recovered after the trauma and was ready to play.
The fuel journey will be driven by a tax manoeuvre that increases the mineral mining tax (FDI) on oil while reducing export duties and raising excise duties.
In the view of the experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyar Court was kidnapped by a hit on the head
The unknown attacked the President of the Krasnoyar District Court, Vladimir Two-Ekonko, by stealing his certificate.

Money and other valuables were not taken by criminals.
He made it home on his own, and he only went to the police the next day.
Crime investigation and the search for criminals are under way.

U.S. Secretary: Sometimes the security forces “went too far” to collect data
The Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that in collecting data and auditions, U.S. security forces sometimes “went too far”, but the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about listening to 70 million people did not correspond to reality.
I assure you, innocent people did not get hurt during this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it has gone too far and has been wrong.
I recognize that, as the President admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," the Secretary of State of the AFP quoted him as saying.
Italian workers with internships give way to young people
Italian unemployment beats records.
Wednesday's data showed that 12.5 per cent of the country's population is now unemployed.
Such bad things have not been done since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15-24 years are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This experiment has already been carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and legislation has allowed the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for interned workers.
On the other hand, Italy is awaiting a common problem for Europe for the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that premature rotation will justify themselves.
What will be the result of the construction of the TPU in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transportation hubs (TSIs).
By 2020, it is planned to implement 255 TPs.
What is really turning the project into was our correspondent's understanding.
A few months ago, a construction block was set up on the Smolenska subway of the Arbatsky-Pokrovska Line.
The inscription stated that the transshipment node was being constructed.
All of this was very strange, since no ground transportation stops near Smolenski and therefore cannot be moved.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 metres, including the ground crossing through the Carmanic Strait.
It's almost over at Smolensky's now.
The flower larek disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt changed before the entrance.
That's the whole transport unit.
Transport nodes are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
There's no capital market yet.
The flats include the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and the improvement of facilities.
In fact, it is not even the transporters who are involved in the flat-rate MSPs, but the professional contractors from the Moscow Capital Repair Department.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Mikhail Blinkin High School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs above the head and board to announce the time of arrival.
For example, the Yasenevo subway has recently opened a fully fledged flat transplant node.
Let it be without curtains, but with intercepting parking spaces and a board indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in the pursuit of the number, officials record everything in the M.P.U.
As early as 2011, the Ministry had planned to build on all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans now account for as much as 255 TPs by 2020.
One and a half are promised this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of MSPs, no quality criteria have been identified, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
The number of sites is reported, but the quality of transplantation on each site is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the expert ' s opinion, should be two: first, reduction in transplant time, second, convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, it is sometimes the opposite of the TPD.
That's a good example of the Metro WDNH.
In the past, suburban buses from the Jaroslav highway came to the square before the main entrance to the VUC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslava to the streets of the cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far beyond the monorails, but closer to the homes.
Although the residents did not want the car under the windows at all, they complained at all possible times.
With the capital force in Moscow, it didn't come out at once.
The first one started building five years ago on Planner Metro.
The project was intended to become a model.
Indeed, there has been a pattern of how the transplant node paid to investors becomes a banal trading centre.
No, there's a bus platform, a gurney to stay out of the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, chemical trolleybuses Nos.202 and No.203 in Moscow's TPP were not given seats in principle.
How they were taken away from the subway by strangers.
But there are more places to trade.
There's only 32 store clothes, and there's almost everything from zoos to car showrooms.
In fact, suddenly, who on the bus would need to buy a new car?
We have, when they're building a capital M.O., somehow we always get a mall.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park decided to be placed on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planerna" station, there is a combat trade.
Fruits, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and security guards looking at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally become a bazaar.
The thing is, there was a market at Planner's before, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture of merchants, they regretted it and released the intercepting parking of the transplant node.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market has been demolished to build a new flat station in its place.
That's a rock.
The Kalujska subway distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping centre, it is said that the distance has increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go around it under the open sky.
After all, the constructions on Planner and Klužski will soon be shown as flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Ministry approved planning decisions for the first eight capital MSPs.
Four of them will be 25 stories without counting two or three subways.
The main monster will grow up on the Tushino subway, with 418.7 thousand square feet of space.
The representatives of the Railway Stations Directorate, which is responsible for the construction of the subway station, have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be located in future multi-storey areas.
At the same time, officials assure us that multi-layered parking is between a third and a half of the area.
Take, for example, the "people's" garages.
For example, the 258-seat garage, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So it's going to take about 80,000 square meters for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars.
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Have one or two floors on every bus platform.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
And these are, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the major railway stations and stations are built by railways, the remaining sites will be conquered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many “functional objects”, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, in the Moscow City Property Department, journalists have recently been told that they are drafting a decree that investors will be able to seek a station for the TPU to officials directly.
No contests.
Because, please, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The perfect TP is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or Spades in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.
There's no excess trade around here.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we're not building anything, or we're digging 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests that an insult to patriotic feelings be compared to extremism
In order to protect citizens' patriotic feelings against provocations and insults directed against Russia, Justice Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish five years in prison.
As reported by the newspaper Ivestija, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the Thought Committee on Energy of Oleg Miheev are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizens, the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship of the person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, there are sanctions in domestic law for abuse of the formal signs of State authority - the flag and the coat of arms.
However, in the view of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulted by State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country is insufficient in Russian law.
As an example, he cites the annual victory day debates where some media figures question the heroic efforts of the people of the USSR to fight the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday, Victory Day 9 May, the current vaqhanalia is unfolding annually.
By practicing in the wit and “alternative view” of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I find this totally unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation, - said Oleg Miheev.
In addition, according to Miheev, patriotic people in Russia are far more than religious, but the law penalizes the feelings of believers and insults patriotic feelings are almost unpunished.
In the opinion of the popular electorate, it is necessary to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill penalizes the abuse of patriotic feelings, ranging from 100,000 fines to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The 6.6 magnitude earthquake took place on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo area in central Chile, is transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, is specified on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The pushers were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
No reports of victims or ground-based destruction have yet been made.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so earthquakes of various forces are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
Then the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: 9.5 was recorded in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace will be dealt with fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained activists of Greenpeace are French nationals.
Pierre Pizanu, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," Mr. Ero's "RIA Novosti" quoted him as saying.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws”, said Dmitry Medvedev.
He said that the activities of any entity that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like powder barrels” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, which was transmitted by “RIA Novosti”.
UN declares new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately start working on a new set of Millennium Development Goals tasks that were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in moving the goals of sustainable development towards the replacement of the MDGs, which expire in 2015, until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening.
They were included in the outcome of a document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit at night that the time had come to “stand above national interests”.
“I am pleased that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of achieving the universal goals of sustainable development — CSD,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the concept of development beyond 2015.
I will make every effort to use the powers vested in me by Member States to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of a conflict of influential people
Under the statues of Samara Machel, president-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at a rare demonstration here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business costume to a T-shirt, decorated with the inscription “We require security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital area of Independence on Thursday.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been reported, one of the most brutal conflicts since the armistice was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 Armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to go back to a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
Rates are high for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge oil and coal reserves in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Valle from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling political party since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of being tense.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has been the instigator of the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional fence of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels subsequently intensified when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times of Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking a soldier.
President Armand Gebuz tried to defuse fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt “a failure”, who wanted to use “everything that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelim and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased after Mazanga had been reported to have declared that Renamo had refused the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he had in mind non-compliance with the Frelimo agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between the parties have little to do to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Hebuza and Dhlakam) who were struck by the foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakening movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who was to leave the post next year when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multiparty democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency”, Mazanga said.
It is not clear what opportunities Renamo has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway routes for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
Unsatisfaction has increased by the Government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent Mediacoop media company.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, which must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people simply wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelim, they just want peace to be restored, they want free access to roads,” he said.
A series of Art Mainstream premieres will take place in Moscow
The Art Mainstream series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go camping, will be held at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
He will launch the Art Mainstream programme, the French comedy of director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of the Maye model (Kerichi himself) working in the French capital, which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Dook "Mebius", the melodramatic bypass by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Adel Life" by Abdelatif Kesh.
The only Russian participant in Art Mainstream will be the winner of Alexander Veledinski's film "Geographer Globe Propylene" at the Kinotavr festival on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's one-name novel.
The main role played by Constantine Habensky, who was also awarded the Kinotavra Prize, was by Victor Slukin, a successful loser.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor could show that “the brute force cannot defeat the subtle cunning, ” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths will prove to be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley Holland advocates “a careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I advocated the introduction of them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “represents interest” in children, while the main ideas are “encouraged” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, also wrote the Norwegian Myths Compendium for Penguin and the British People's Tales, said: “You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps a big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there is a need for an innate understanding of good and bad.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show, not tell.
A football fan was detained in Voronezh district, breaking a window in the train station waiting room
At nine o'clock on the evening of 29 October, two Moscow-born football fans were taken off the passenger train at the Grazy Voronezh station.
On their way to play the favorite team, the boys made a drunken debut on the train.
Young people were taken to the police station on duty to prepare a report on the administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets to the next train and waited for it to arrive at the station.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and kicked the front door window into the train station waiting room.
A transport police officer and the RZD CHP security guard ran into the bell of the broken glass.
They were able to detain a criminal trying to escape the scene.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is being audited by members of the South-East LOU.
The issue of criminal proceedings is being addressed, a senior reference for the provision of information and public relations to the South-East L.O.U.M.D. of Russia in the transport of Sergey Olkhovic.
Vitaly Mutko: Waterworks?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion of the riots on the stands during the Russian Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am in favour of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they've taken a stand.
They're expecting someone to come to the side and put it in order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
We need to organize the sick, the clubs have to invite their flight attendants, not put the case on its own.
We have now developed a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once it's adopted, we'll deal with this problem very closely.
But I'm still going to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give me the law faster.
It feels like they're Bavarian sickos in Jaroslavl, and they're all set up.
And we're foreign observers.
It's a terrible thing to see a rostrum being poured out of a brand-a-spoy.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years," Mutko said.
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
The ex-employee of the American Special Forces, Edward Snowden, is likely not to go outside Russia to testify in cases involving the hearing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone talks.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation may answer questions from representatives of the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US Allied countries," the agency's interlocutor said.
“In principle, the General Prosecutor ' s Office of the WG could either send its representatives to the RF or refer written questions to Snowden”, the source added, adding that the issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Earlier, German Ambassador Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of a hearing by the U.S. Special Forces of the German Chancellor's negotiations.
Snowden stands ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
A CIA ex-employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions for his arrival," Euronews TV channel reported to Strabel.
Lawyer Snowden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, then published information on secret U.S. security surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow through transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who had made serious accusations to him in absentia, and remained in the Sheretiev airport transit zone until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheretiev on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said that his client had arranged for a job with a large Russian company.
Last week, German media reported an NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the chancellor's phone calls began to be heard by Americans back in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of the information, the German authorities stated that the monitoring of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left "Just Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from the Fair Russia party, member of its branch in Novosibirska, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the New Siberian regional office of the party.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "justices".
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilia Ponomarev is putting on the table a portrait," but there is nothing so epochal about it," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional “Eser” office.
However, the mandate of the deputy of the State of Ilya Ponomarev is not intended to be waived.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not come out of it by law.
Reports of Ilia Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valery Zubov would come out of the “SR” with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan to discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kissida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, said the meeting of Kissid.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that, after the Prime Minister of Japan, Sinzo Abe, had visited Russia, relations between countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan on difficult political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed North Territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding that the land lost after the Second World War be returned to the country.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which a loudspeaker is reported, "Return to the northern territories!"
The police do not stop the protesters, they keep the noise from going up.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, an oestrad artist named Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in the conversational manner.
In time, Fay's innovation was captured by others, quite recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines standup club, celebrates her tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these hedgehogs started in Carolines and then achieved more success, reached a level where they are already too famous to be in the club,” said Hersh.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes the performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standup for Heroes, an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among others Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comics participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example through a show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has been briefed on his role in the comedy series on a small-known cable channel (especially the FXX League) and now he runs his own comedy Central skit show.
Jenny Slatt joined the cast both on Saturday night on live television and on "Parks and Leisure Zones", although she is most famous for the Marcelle Boots series of viral rollers.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a vicious, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a standup comic, but then he became a successful director on television and at the movies, as well as an informal historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when I came here, he sometimes walks down some alley between the two houses and thinks, "If I'm broke, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities began negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country to Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Klegg to discuss relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the Taliban dialogue had begun,” says a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but act independently in the north-western regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously tried to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities took the troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were operating and released from the prisons of detained Islamists.
Navas Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil fell into the price of $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large stocks had darkened the message showing that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining strength.
The US oil class in December was set at 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for later morning after European time in electronic auctions at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was set at 39 cents, a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US stocks had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stocks were more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery may continue to take effect after the third quarter ' s growth rate has risen to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The Brent oil is a reference class of international oil, also used by U.S. oil refiners, and has cost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Main coach “Colorado” Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the golfer Semen Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday's game with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind the bars did not waver his confidence in the Russian, transferred Natalia Schmeleva, from Dallas.
What do we have to wait for, Rua said after the morning breakup of Lavin.
Of course, all of us are concerned about what happened, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to get on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the doorman's condition?
We'll see about that today.
Surely our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in the previous games of this season.
Mainly, no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court finds out.
You shouldn't be a vegan in Siberia. A warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely renounced products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot bear winter without loss of health, and no warm tomatoes compensate them, according to New Siberian nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking butter with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they give up not only meat and fish but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other towns in Siberia, strict food standards are at least useless for health.
Full abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by vegetation.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet" - a certain dietologist Marina Bodai.
It gives an example of a fish containing indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
Their richest vegetable oil is flax.
"If you need it for human consumption, you have to drink with a liter!" says the nutritionist.
The doctors are convinced that Siberians should be given special attention in the winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In the context of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, it takes increased calories.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, therefore, this calorieity is not collected”, says the specialist.
Dr. Olga Poznak agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is best for a person to feed primarily on foods grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter people want not to bite the cucumber, but the hot soup or something lighter," the doctor explains his position.
She said that from what vegans can do, it's really useful to have different herbs, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples left in winter, frozen berries.
But that is clearly not enough for a full diet.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the levels of vitamins in Siberian organisms are sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees and snow in May, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and this is first of all fat," the doctor notes.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by veggies, we give them undervalue.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"Vegans don't get it," is for sure God.
Arifulina says that an adult is willing to choose whatever it takes to play the toys he wants.
He's already got an organism, a skeleton, organs.
Still, children must eat fully.
If parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he eats for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substance for brain development, vision, bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she said.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of heat and imported vegetables and fruit grown in winter.
What is also brought to us in heat plants contains fewer micronutrients than what is needed in open soil.
"The quality of the products is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to reap a greater harvest can be harmful to quality.
“The apples don’t get brown on the cut, the cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, the tomatoes tasteless and non-romantic,” states medical examples, adding that they are probably filled with excess fertilizer.
And they don't become suppliers of vitamins, they become cells.
This is not the case with the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Affairs, candidate for rural sciences Vera Petruk.
She said that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in the greenhouses, it was possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive more off the square metre, they will, of course, become more frequent and feed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but watery and non-sweet," she explained, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the producer's conscience.
The Court suspended the enforcement of the “stop-and-go” decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department ' s “stop-and-reveal” programme and dismissed the judge from the case.
The United States Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until the outcome of the appeal lodged by the city had been obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing a programme on street detention and interrogation.
The city has filed an appeal against its decision and the corrective orders, including the requirement to appoint a controller to help the police department change its practices and associated training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it had violated the code of conduct of the U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of prejudice, partly because of the series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably turning to blacks and Latin Americans under the “stop-and-reveal” programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes, including policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test the video cameras attached to the police stations where most of the detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of keeping the names and addresses of the people on whom the cases were discontinued after the police check.
The city's appeal debate should take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Circumstances have been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all national minorities, filed a collective suit.
Supporters of the “stop-and-go” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, form a more reliable and effective police service and can influence how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the fighting spirit of police officers, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money, and do not address the more global challenge of the police because of the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stop-and-reveal” which was consistent with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Trelyakow Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Trelyakow Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokustskaya subway station to the Boletna plaza.
All the time, street towels, flowerhouses, benches, urns and toilets have been installed, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovski and Lavručina alleys, which had already been pedestrians, five streets - the Ordinsky Stupik, the Great and the Little Tolmačevský oulka, the Kadašev coast and the swampy area - were closed for cars.
There is no limit to the movement of transport along the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka.
On the section of the Petnica street from the lobby of the Novakuznetskaya station to Klimentovska trekulka, the conditions for pedestrians created without removing the movement and cutting of the carriage section, is passed by newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Triakov Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the pope of Rome, the museum, the library, monuments, and other sights.
In the past, the Tver Pass, Stolešnikov Reulk and Kuznetski Most were fully pedestrians.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is determined to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone break-in to verify the confidential message
Former newspaper editor News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone break-in, surveillance and opposition” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, which was then held by the Minister of the Interior.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special adviser,” Hanna Polby.
The newspaper commissioned Private Detective Glenn Mulker to hack into Polby’s voicemail and monitor her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, ” the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will be standing next to someone's house, hoping to find someone excited, he is the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they will say,” said Mr. Addis.
He said that the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone burglary, surveillance, and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors of Clark's novel for the first time drew attention to the news of the world when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
The voice-mail cassette received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private detective's computer, where Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Addis.
At that time, former reporter-in-chief Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap controlled Ms. Polby's movements.
Having left her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Addis said that Coulson's participation in the story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blankett about the affair with a married woman while he himself had met with a relative named Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people with a view to breaking into telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcair, Terlbek, and Wezerap confessed to a phone break-in.
Snowden declares his willingness to communicate with the authorities of the FRG in the hearing case
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the authorities of the FRG, reports RIA Novosti.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the representative of the Bundestage Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Streblje met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Twerska Street
Four passersby were injured as a result of a fire in a train station in downtown Moscow, Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured during a fire in a smoke tunnel.
According to RIA Novosti, referring to the head of the Pavlovinsky Fuel and Energy Department of the Capital, electricity has now been fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat station near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke coming out of the sewers, and smoke was formed in the underground passageway near the Armenie store.
As a result of the fire, there were 11 houses in the Tver Street.
At 21:45 p.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts food allowance for the poor
The four-person family allowance is reduced by $36 a month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food vouchers known as “Fudstempa” has been declining since the end of the relevant State programme.
For a family allowance of four, it will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012, one person ' s allowance was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States increased to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by “Foodstamps”, which has been called since the time they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and to help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress require further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
Food shop owners all over America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
US congressmen continue to argue as much as possible to reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
Blizzard released her 1994 Blackthorne on PC for free.
That's what WoW Insider reports.
According to his report, the game was available at Battle.net in the section of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that at present only users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can land it.
The game is also not yet available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has just released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
Soundtrek to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, released by Blizzard 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events were unfolding on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once upon a time, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king of Vloros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vláros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Sarlaq's men and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game the studio released after its name was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There will be new machine guns in the Moscow metropolis.

One trip of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by means of modern technology, itar-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new sports tickets, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions Alexei Nekova and Elena Zalodčikov, will host.
National Security Agency confessions reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
In late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, it was tasked to photograph the roof of the United States Mission Building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to detect listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence of the United States, reiterated in September that the United States was not using the possibility of external intelligence “to steal the secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies in order to improve their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who has become a public defender, has begun publishing his treasure of US intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer convinced that the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was a report that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped for perhaps ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can become a target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there was intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's very likely that this data is being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY Advisory Agency.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the United States had transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in Germany says we have to create a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of the U.S. intelligence agencies, known for the discovery of Snowden, was a shock to some companies who previously thought that China was at the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technologies where European corporate leaders have better realized that data stored in the United States is within the same jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the U.S. cloud provider since the disclosure of the American programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneab, one of the SAP executives, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely evidence of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What happens to economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
“It has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate, ” says Kurt Bok, CEO of BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the responses they have taken, as this can give the opponent an advantage.
The idea of taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room has long been learned in large companies — at least recklessly.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of Audi Automotive Company, says that for many years it has been a standard practice to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign visits because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to burglaries and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV report.
The United States of America is warning its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France and Russia and Israel in a second series of violators engaged in economic intelligence hackers, after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “Frenches are the worst”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young man in Georgia who died “inadvertently, ” believe that their son was killed
The parents of a young man from Georgia whose body was found inside a broken sports mat in his high school gym believed that their son had been killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Waldosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a upright mat, sheltered behind the rostrums in his high school gym.
Police investigators at the Loundez County Sheriff's Department have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of 17-year-olds is challenging it.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They think that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and the common sense,” said Kramp.
They think it's a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe that there is sufficient ground” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office in Loundez County was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the surveillance cameras that the investigators were watching.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the videos contained the key to how he died.
“Spartak”: For information on persons who have displayed Fascist symbolism

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the monitoring of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the United States Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff of food allergies among children and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenalin stocks — most often using an automatic EpiPen injection syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative authorities of the states have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to supply less difficult adrenaline.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is in my tongue”, “it feels like I have hair on my tongue” or “the tongue is pinching”.
Parents of intersexual children may choose “unspecified sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with external genitals of intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to identify sex as “unspecified” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on sex assignment to newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said many years later, “I am not a man or a woman.”
I'm going to be made by doctors with a very flattering product with bruises and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with “sexual development disorder” — a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (esophageals or seeds) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identification is still insufficient, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to allocate it than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if any.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them," he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people get gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as distinct from transgender or transgender, since their condition is not gender-specific but biological, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both at the same time or not.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body structure; primary sexual signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome and hormone structure.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first man to be recognized as “free” by the court, claiming the right to maintain “unspecified” sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to France ' s news release 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with German law, wrote that “in a situation where the world is being dragged into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also reported to Baby Zone that she would prefer to have children set up at birth.
“It is difficult enough to raise a child without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to her parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites — a beautiful Greek god who had both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw a gender as a leaf on which to erase everything and then re-paint it.
But now many challenge ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and that doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how the child will perceive the sex he has acquired when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century this was called an urgent psychiatric case,” Dresher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who felt that gender was easily subject to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social — how parents grow children — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during carefree circumcision, to castrate the child completely, removing his eggs, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfying with the result”.
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he could never live a “full life” of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital and ovum were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“ I knew I wasn’t a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned a vaginalplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized something was wrong, he needed medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and removing his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people's perceptions of intersexuality into line.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “encourages the hanging of labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child “unspecified sex”, she said.
We fear that he will facilitate intervention.
We think it's better to adopt male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Teram-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose for the third sex”.
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she said.
The German law implies its assignment at birth.
It is a battle that little children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a mammologist in Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual disabilities who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete insensitivity syndrome to androgens”.
Since her androgic receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female symptoms.
She has moisture, but she doesn't have uterines and ovaries.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie's married and going to the Children's Psychiatric Office at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite her infertility, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and look into the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “manly” or “female”.
In that case, you're fine, growing up a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and removes the anxiety that moves parents because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which sex he or she is comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago Gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin emphasized that he understood that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six matches from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missing match.
We must play well, and in the last two games I have failed to do so, CSNChicago says Habibulina.
- I have to find confidence in training, I think it's worth treating them like games, and try to get a better outcome.
You need to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good about training.
But somehow after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The doormen -- I don't think I'm that alone -- are always trying to have the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I can't miss so many nails.
It's great that my teammates support me, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next game better.
A bus turned over on Altaea.

According to the department, the accident occurred around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka road, 1 km from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and drivers on the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all injured by various degrees of gravity and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the City Hospital No. 1, Rubtsovska, and two persons were hospitalized in the Rubtsovska CRB.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects that after the consolidation of the Latin American and Asian markets, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be deployed to Europe.
“We expect to receive such agreements in total more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type”, explains the Interfax of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia at a press conference with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro of France.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be shared with our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will eventually return to France," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Suhogo Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is based on modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in the 100 passenger seats segment.
Dnepropetrovska energy has launched a unique rescue program... an Astina nest.
In the old age, the peasants on the high pole set the wheel from the calf to bring it to the court, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have long been put away, so the aist loved the pillars of the power lines, and the intertwined branches rely on the wire, which makes the real house secure.
Anja’s grandmother, who had lived in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky for twenty years, began to notice the nest sitting in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already squeezing between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity to have a family of aristocrats nested in the courtyard each year, brought out and fed three or four birds in summer, but without the light, it is not desirable.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm countryside, Ana’s grandmother called the Czarichan Res, who owned the fort.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, said Dneproblenergo Technical Director Sergey Berezowski.
Corrosion has already begun on wires that have already been found inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms.
At any time, the birds could have died from electrical power.
The locals also risked losing light because of the damage to the wires.
Thus, the linear monters began the nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnepropetrov National University helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They did training for district network staff.
A well-known daytime ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energy at all stages of the reconstruction of nests.
To begin with, it has been estimated that more than 50 genuine apartments are in the emergency area.
Special metal platforms were brewed to renovate them.
The foundation was lined with hedges, and then the old nest was moved there.
In the opinion of the experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
After that, the Aist builds their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka Novomoskovsky region.
Next to the power plant, they set up a new steel column and placed a platform with an old, already populated nest on it.
The whole operation cost the energy of 9,000 bracelets.
The same new village was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky in the courtyard of Ana’s grandmother.
Here the platform was fixed in the old place, only lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartment has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to have four more nests in the Pochrovsky and Tsaričan regions of Dnepropetrovsk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
During the day, the whole area was covered with sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolic Region, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a swan family in the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans; the locals fed them and did not insult them.
When the villagers, when they heard the shots, ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now members of the Apostolic Police Department find out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On the 4th of November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will host the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian Marches has been increasing, with 40 per cent of citizens already agree with the idea of conducting them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for the Russian Marches, 11 per cent of which are definitely positive and 29 per cent are rather positive.
The popularity of the Russian Marches is gradually increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these shares in 2006, and in December 2010, more than twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supported such activities.
"Definitely negative" for "Russian Marches" refers to only 7 per cent of Russians, "presumably negative" 19 per cent.
Another 35 per cent were unable to express their attitude towards the action.
This year, the Moscow Mayor agreed to hold a Russian March of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, as reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This action of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Have you heard that the Russian Marches are held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans for the protection of Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Now only one Russian (20 per cent) knows about this action.
Significantly, almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard in December 2010 on the Russian Marches.
It will be recalled that three years ago, a natural nationalist rally took place on 11 December in Manner Square, which turned into a mass riot.
Levada Centre also asked the Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the correct answer ( Day of National Unity) has increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
After all, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Moscow's mayor agreed to the Russian March in Lublin
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublin.
This was reported by the Russian leader, the organizer of the march, Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to walking to Lublin on People's Unity Day, there will be a rally and a rock concert by the Kolovrat Group, also agreed with the authorities.
How'd the "Russian March 2012" go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from the Yakiman Coast to the Central House of the Artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s pre-election headquarters considered the exception of Byden in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Byden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected books by Mark Galperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign “Stats doubled: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the ready-to-come book and reported on Thursday evening that the President's closest assistants had conducted “large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of Baiden could help to raise the hopes of re-election of Obama.
According to political observer The Times of Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by high-ranking officers of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House administration Bill Daley, to assess the impact on the vote of former Secretary Clinton Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago Pre-election Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six presidential advisers — including Daley, former head of the election headquarters of Obama Jim Messin and former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Puff — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The Book of Doubles states that Daley was the initiator of the attempt to replace Byden, despite their “close personal relationship”, but eventually refused this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not “improve Obama’s substantial chances”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, the administration has indeed considered the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
“I actively advocated the consideration of many things, and it was one of them,” said the daily newspaper.
You should remember that the President was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we supposed to do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had invested enough in examining whether the dividend would bring about the vote.
“Pre-election headquarters do not spend such amounts of money on interviews and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had been exploring the possibility of substitution.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his boss at the time about a possible move.
Although he said that he did not think that the President “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “possible”, Obama knew.
Martin added that the double bets did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political sensing had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
“It’s possible,” Martin replied.
Would you like a light in the dark of the ice cream?
The British business has created the world’s first ice - creamed jellyfish in the dark.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop the glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person eating it, increasing the pH in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me, I'm Tasty", says, "This is an amazing thing, but it's still at the very beginning of the production phase, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of substance."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue in neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase the pH and the ice cream will start to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it's creating such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
That's why it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of dry gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
That's not possible by definition because of the ice crystals fracture, which is ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach Avantgarda Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the KHL regular championship match against Salawat, noted that the omijas carried out a thorough analysis of the impact of the Magnitude Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that "Avant-garde" should be given increased attention to the defence game.
We watched a video game against the Magnetic Metallurg, which brings in the official site "Avantgarde" of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of nails, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes because of their failure to perform the game assignment.
We knew the rival had performers.
Statistically, they had five attacks on us, three of us were killed.
It's a very good reality.
These mistakes were taken into account when preparing for today's game?
Every match we play, every match we know, every match we talk about after the game, we're ready for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is in place.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game assignment was 2-0.
They missed the goal in the locker room, and in the third period they started to make mistakes.
Given the difficulty of the game, he did not see the point of getting the defenders involved.
We need to defend the entire team.
Now, Avantgarde has a long home series, matches go in a day, and the team gets tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of its moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you're doing the installation, it's not that difficult.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of vans have been on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drinkers with drinking water and to set up biotuals
Hundreds of vans were dug at the border crossings as they entered Russia.
This situation has arisen as a result of a change in the rules for the processing of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating a queue that has not warned of innovations in advance.
Since 28 October, the customs authorities of Russia have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, according to Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The pass points are in enhanced mode.
The FACT correspondent visited the border and communicated with the long-range hostages of the situation.
Prices in the coffee shop at the Novoazovsk Pass are rising every day, as is the case with the van.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novoazovsk-Vezno-Veznoznek Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine along the international highway.
From there, goods are dispatched to Stavropolsk Region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, and after these rules were introduced, the long-range fighter Alexei Golovanev (the photo) was complaining about transiting goods through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been staying in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is taken.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 rubles (about 1100 - 1300 bracelets).
Those who drive near (for example, Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 bracelets) and pass through.
And the rest of them are stuck, because no one has that much money.
You can imagine if the driver is carrying a shipment of only $4,000, but up to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (at least 23,000 bracelets) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are met by long-range fighters who are located near their cars.
In border stores and cafes, it's always expensive, but prices like this, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers focused and quickly rolled them up: 15 bracelets stand for a baton, seven bracelets for a cup of coffee, and 25 bracelets for a plate of soup.
There's only one coffee.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the steppe, we're going to the bathroom.
Don't wash or shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week. My wife set it up for me.
For a week, another long-range fighter, Victor Scottarenko, comforts himself.
Is it gonna be my turn in a week?
Why do you have one and a half gallons of water?
There's 11 and 15 bracelets.
What, is it the crystal bottle or is it the water on the silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take it while there's still something else, it's steaming the store.
Following media coverage, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosievsky and Novoazov Rajagosadministrations has been instructed to ensure that all those who make up the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, are provided with a statement by the Acting Chairman of the Donetskian Office of the Sergey Dergunov.
The ambulance crew is now on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotulets will also be installed to make people feel comfortable.
According to the official, the problem of order will be resolved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk Authority, 32 and 68 vehicles were used at the International Postmark and Novoazowsk crossings on 31 October, respectively.
Facts will monitor developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking individuals of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is about to “speak” to President Dali Gribauskat of Lithuania and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhiwa, which refer to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the training of the information attack is conducted by the Department of Public Administration Analysis of the Russian Presidential Administration for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party.
A member of Department B. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, visited Lithuania regularly before the end of 2012, and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the territory of the country.
Before long, the president of Lithuania, Gribauskay, stated that she knew about the information she was preparing for her.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country's desire for energy independence” were the main reasons.
The Lithuanian leader has not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she claimed that Lithuania was "inadequately respected" in the Kremlin.
In addition, Gribauscay accused the head of RF Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania "one claim only".
Recall, in September, Rosobnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not in conformity with the health and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government of the country should prepare for the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot adolescents.
The director of an American secondary school was literally desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
There was an incident in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hoodlums threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the school director opened fire on adolescents, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the Director ' s property, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail in $125.000.
Notably, shooting civilians in the U.S. is becoming a terrible pattern.
Literally earlier, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest, California, U.S.A., right down the street.
Then the criminal took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to hide.
Shots were fired at Newton’s elementary school in Connecticut.
Adam’s mother worked at school, and she was a teacher.
Shooting in American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place at an American school on 31 January, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were killed: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat confetti, not to lie down late and make a masquerade for our area.
Now I'm more like a screwdriver.
I haven't been invited to hand out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won't this year.
But statistics show I'm a white crow about Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on confetti, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I expect from every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Trade Federation predicts that the suits will cost $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sex professionals; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daft Punk-style cosmonauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, costumes most often sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Trade Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to confetti, we don't get small.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds confetti, Twizzlers and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Trade, this is excellent news for 41 million children demanding confetti who have prepared to conquer our areas.
What's more, we're going to buy and — and we're not going to fool ourselves — we're going to eat £90 million of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn-grained confetti; and yet, according to the National Association of Conductors, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
It's nothing like Halloween at home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “Woe behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “Woe and Cry” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with apparitions generating about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described your friend on Facebook, and then you can't put away the guy you like, sees this photograph and leaves a comment like "class expression of face."
And finally, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tits when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating Christmas tree, what we do with childhood.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin fashion only started last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Office, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your wing, probably came from Illinois State, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try cutting off some of their pumpkins at £2032.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia was restored after the cyber attack in the morning, the press office reported.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Information and Administrative Affairs, Timar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with many requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, so far the site has been restored.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Peterkop to Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it's too early to talk about who staged the attacks.
“We must examine the causes of the incident and make our findings, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents completely”, he acknowledged.
On 1 November, Nakam, Anonymous Ukraine deployed a network that confirmed the hacking of the Estonian Mino-Defense site and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not serve NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be anyone's slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," said the anonymous statement.
Earlier, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence had reported that the Marine Corps of the Feodosian detached battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would participate in the NATO response team training exercises Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the violence of the impure force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed down
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because of the fact that students were being attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder said, children were panicking, and it was impossible to continue.
The story of the goblins may sound like the invention of a child for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, the hospital closed down in Zimbabwe because of the fact that goblins also attacked the medical staff.
Announcing the release of the Land Rover race series
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a package of services providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between activities can be obtained.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants turning to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We were very happy to develop the Defendor Challenge — a truly attractive championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces know nothing about the Bratski Klok group - New
This is referred to by INTERFAX.RU, referring to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports of the U.S. Ministry of Finance Leps' introduction to the checklists of the Eurosian Criminal Union of the Brethren Circle, we looked at all the databases, but we did not find such groups,” said the Agency’s interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributed to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written, yesterday the U.S. Department of Finance published a list of alleged members of the Bratski Klog criminal group on its website.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as "Grisha," they put it out the day before.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others were mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, they believe that Gregory Lepps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried money for the bandits on their orders.
This message is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and contains all of his data that correspond to the facts.
What's more, Leps really bought a house on Phuket recently.
The Department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person on the United States of America ' s blacklists entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maja Serikov said that there were no notifications to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the U.S. scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
There were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they existed in such cases.
"And of course this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, surprising and unexpected," she said to RIA Novosti.
She said that Phuketa does not live, but according to the U.S. Minfin, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long journey to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him during a flight to Blagovestensk.
Ran out to the field in the Shinnik match.
Some details became known about the identity of the fan who fled the field during the match 1/16 of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavska "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
According to the head of the CDC, Artur Grigoriantz, referring to the MVD data, the patient is a Moscowian.
He's in custody right now.
"In addition, Grigorians said how the fan managed to break into the field: "It was clear that the data, we will call it a viewer, was sent to an ambulance to accompany the two viewers, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, and the ambulance confirmed it to us.
And then he pushed out two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is a flight attendant area of action - the police cannot interfere with what is in the field.
He made it to the rostrum, crossed the eastern rostrum.
At that time, riots began on the Eastern Court and on the treadmills," the head of the CDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDK of the Moscow "Spartak" will hold the upcoming 15th round of the Russian Championship against Lokomotiva and Zenita without viewers and will pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire teams were called in to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career retreat.
Cocker-Spaniel Ruby ran off after she got into a small accident.
Three days later, a man walking his dog noticed her in a career.
The firemen came down on a rope on the slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was fortunate to be rescued after fire brigades were called to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he was somehow stuck at 50 feet at the dangerous distance of the suspension slope.
The nine-month-old coker, Ruby, fled after being in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her boss, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and her 20-year-old friend, Becky Hall, were at the Fleppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire department.
They feverishly searched for their missing dog and posted calls on social media sites after she fled to her career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, Ruby noticed a dog - dog driver at 50 feet on a career retreat.
A technical rescue team from the Clechton Fire Station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transmission to lift her up the slope.
A rescue officer named Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the slope — 50 feet [50 feet] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she totally froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is amazing.
A rescue officer named Peter Lau said, "Ruby's lucky she was rescued."
It was likely that she might have been in a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination and it was found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching for salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The vet said that if she'd hung up and lost consciousness, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
That was very brave — what they had done.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
Firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at the Australian radio show this week, the pop star said that she was a backstabber for Jagger's 2004 Old habitats die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and said, "He was playing with me when I was 18. "
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very good."
On Thursday's statement, a representative of seveny-year-old Jagger said that he “categorically denies that he has ever struck for Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: breaking up with Europe gives Scottish people a choice
One more day, another independence scarecrow.
This time, we are warned that the independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with a thorny wire along Adrianova Vala.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, although — what is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member countries are spending a lot of time turning their formal rules around as conveniently as they are.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen area, continuing to fail to comply will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not a worthy story.
And she's so old that she's become a fossil: for the first time, I've heard that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment that's lost in the story of the old fairy tale.
Why should independent Scotland even obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are becoming effective.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptics' “Alternative for Germany” — founded only this year — came out of nowhere and received almost five million votes in September's federal elections, thus essentially pushing the Free Democrats (an analogy of our Liberal Democrats) out of Bundestega.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working in excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe was in a pre-favourable position on productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of rescue is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of the budget and the currency are due to the deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the Green Energy package implemented by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
This is a paralysingly unfavourable price environment, as we have seen in Granjmouth.
No wage freezes in the world will stop the devastating defeat of the US's cheap solar gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, once the EU's fiercest supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and bring Paris to the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France's ruined economy in a plight.
The result is the right-wing party against the EU, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, has just won decisive additional elections by throwing the ruling Socialist party third.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that the division of the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Penn do with its newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — parties against the EU receive support in these elections, the bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being sent together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a floating Europe of sovereign nations, which General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I suppose Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington ' s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be neglected in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed in a more free European agreement, provided we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, as strangely as it is, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011, thanks to objections against reductions in expenditures proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of Thora and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the starting mechanisms for early puberty
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterge is a journalist specializing in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be intimidated if her daughters begin to form the glands of the breast and grow lobular hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes were quite common among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time trying to calm my parents down — this usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” said Kaplovitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, brow and braiding hair and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (first period) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, also author of the book Early Sexual Maturity of Girls: How to Cope With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes the actual occurrence of sexual maturity, but is considered to be “early” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can be a basis for endocrine analysis to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which may ultimately lead to a slowdown in growth and low growth at an adult age.
Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on child age, development, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful with medication, but admits that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate the behavioural problems and feelings of girls, which are different from the peers.”
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene,” said Kaplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose period began at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first one of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual attitudes in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, have sexual maturation earlier.
Caplovitz claims that the assumption that weighs the most is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which linked fat in the body to puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Early puberty is likely to be influenced by everything around the world, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
It is also a mystery that although boys have hair on their face and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of childbearing age are exposed to the appearance of hair and cranial hair.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true occurrence of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child’s endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean a conversation earlier than expected,” explained Kaplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need proof that even when this is done before, it is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing, stuck in Cheetah, is getting ready to take off.
The United States aircraft flying in the open-air treaty over Russian territory, which carried out an unscheduled flight to Cheetah on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's airfield.
The airport manager authorized the flight of the ship to receive fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane will take off at Ulan Uda.
According to other data, he'll be heading to the United States.
The Ulaan-Ude plane reportedly landed in the Zabaykal region because of the fog.
Due to unpaid accounts, he was not released from the airport of Cheetah.
There are 30 persons on board, including a crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports the ITAR-TASS.
According to the RF MOU, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board an aircraft are not allowed to go outside the airport of Chita, they can only undergo border control at two airports in Russia, Cuba and Ulan Uda.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to promote monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, to enhance the capacity to prevent crises and to resolve crises within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - IC in the U.S. IC
A 2013 lively celebrity rating led Madonna, who made $125 million.
But it was overrun by the late Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
It is noticeably lagged behind by other out-of-life celebrities, who have “earned” a few times less last year.
The second in the list of the most "constant" celebrities to be drawn up by Forbes was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the second in the year was the author of Peanuts Charles Schultz comic books, 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were among the top five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein also made the list.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyaeva opened in Moscow
On 23 October, the first flagman boutique, Igor Gulyaev, opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public by his magnificent items from the Lux class of fur.
And now they're going to be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- finally, in Moscow, his first boutique was opened, which is why the designer organized a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure Russia has the most beautiful girls.
So I am especially glad that I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igor used to cut the red tape and invite all those who wanted to... to follow the models!
Jet aircraft manufacturers object to the width of the seat when large orders are made
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute over the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance voyages by the economy class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the attention of airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them playing a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by the Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for the width of a seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy class lounges, but its main American competitor, Boeing, said that this should be decided by the airlines.
The dispute occurs at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of increasingly large versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected for the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 persons are in a row — is central to the declarations of economic efficiency of the new mini-bus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will include 406 people, based on seats in an economic class of more than 17 inches wide, located 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in the economy in seats 18 inches wide, 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues through commercial advertising in the professional press.
Now Airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the Dubai Air Force, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently showed how the new advertising war could start by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant attached to each other, entitled “Would you agree?”
“Boeing offers long-distance flights on seats that are narrower than regional turbine planes,” said airbus sales manager John Lichi.
As the diet changes, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
During the early 1970s, when broad-band Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, the weight of an average American male aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The 21st century average American male waist is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average coverage of the thalia of those recently referred to as “reactive audiences” was already there.
Airbus says that she ordered a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing challenges Airbus numbers by size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon is not limited to the width of the seat.
“It’s all about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said Kent Creever, a specialist at the salons.
They do not want us to decide for them what will profit them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space side by side, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of US to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms up the rivalry between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to market leader in this segment, 365-place Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared features of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of 10 local lines of 777X with the original 9 local layout of the series of constructive decision 777.
Winning in a given self-sufficient way is lower compared to the 10-digit layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to insert more space and make his plane more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Kenston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full 10th row salons for the existing 777s point out that many passengers prefer dense planting, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seats of eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus offer is a threat from the 777th model”, said an interior specialist at Mary Kirby's salon, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver chairs, but they offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Worldly jet vendors even take roulettes with them to check competitive planning.
While commending comfort, all manufacturers also offer very dense aircraft for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 seats, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional alterations to the salons, offering more space to pass on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new anticoagulant vaccine may deprive you of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an antinicin vaccine that could deprive the smoking of pleasure cigarettes.
One dose of vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotinic dependence on life.
Further tests are needed prior to the start of human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecule in the blood by neutralizing it before reaching the brain, preventing it from getting shot by a nicotine smoker.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that weren't given the vaccine were "relaxed," and that's a sign that nicotine came to their brain, researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette that prevents nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of it,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleniks: three rural settlements in Podmozków
Deputy Governor Yury Olejnikov said that almost one third of Moscow's rural settlements were entirely subsidized
Total grants from the region ' s budget are received from 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent the grant.
Some 25 billion roubles are channelled from the regional budget," said Olenik.
The Deputy Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mystišč, Odintsovo and Pushkino - had more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, “not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administration in 88 settlements in Podmozkowya is over 70 per cent, “with lower quality of services”, said Olenik.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of the municipal entities of Sub-Moscow before the end of November to consider which settlements needed to be enlarged, integrated into urban districts or to change the administration system.
These proposals will be implemented by the end of January.
Previously, the Governor of Moscow stated that administrative reform in Sub-Moscow planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mojai, Kashir, Solnečnore, Cologne, Lubertz and Kotelnikah there is a request for the expansion of municipalities.
The discussion in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
President Mosbyduma Igor Brynzalov also stated that some 30 rural settlements in 12 sub-Mozkow regions were planning to unite in the coming adm reform.
This is due to the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have an “acceptable” financial base and 100 have grants.
Diana Arbenina was celebrating Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenin does not hide the great pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Even though Arbena now spends a great deal of time with creativity and public activity, she still finds the opportunity to drive with Martha and Artem, not only wasting time on their studies but also enjoying it as much as she can.
During the last week, Diane twice reported on her teaching talents to her worshipers.
At first, she posted a picture on Facebook showing how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she talked to the fans, showed them how she had Artema and Martha on Halloween.
Our first halloween" - that's what Diana called a picture of her kids dressed in holiday costumes.
That is not wise, for like any other Russian boys and girls, they have a bearing on this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe introduces “unspecified sex” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born of hermaphrodites instead of male or female to indicate “unspecified”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the “sex” count in the birth certificate blank for a period of time.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex) parents may write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is designed not to encourage parents to rush into a sex-specific operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
The tripods deny that they are exposed to Obeid
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripody, will be a figure in the investigation of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Trippodi, denies the change in the rental of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned the shares of three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease agreement to Serqular Ki, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender being issued after their expiration in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Trippody knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate sites, following statements made by Mr. Trippody Lynn Espoul, former Deputy Chief of Administration on Thursday.
During several years of discussions launched in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be open.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the rental contracts for Serqular Ki, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Trippodi, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripoli had acknowledged, had urged changes to the Government ' s rent policy.
The IACC's breakdown of telephone calls included talks in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Trippody and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports following the work of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone calls about the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie, Mr. Trippody.
“No,” replied Mr. Trippody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not the case.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-ranking officer, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
The senior administrative officer in Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The clerk didn't specify what it was for, but he said it was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the aim was the SA-125 rockets.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried aircraft carrying missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of sub-class 457 may be tested for “substantiality”
The “substantiality” test for foreign visa workers of Class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it suggests an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the basis of criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxin McKew criticised the Government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia's neighbours.
“Great statements such as “foreigners — at the end of the line” and “Australian work first” are a very unpleasant setback to the time when trade unions demanded a secure labour market”, she said to the Institute of Australia-India today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the comments of this historical artifact, I would not have been surprised.
The document submitted for discussion sets out the 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of “substantiality” are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to see whether the candidate is genuine in the circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of holders of sub-class 457 visas, since companies previously intending to sponsor a small number of employees have then received hundreds of jobs.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grief - stricken nine - year - old son of this man escorted him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Semen Varlamov's friend said that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A hockey friend named Semen Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinyuk claimed that he was suffering from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” said a woman in particular.
We will recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating the Golkiper of the assembled Russian Federation, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair and beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen, and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police station and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later bailed at $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen in national movements, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026
Baroness Kramer, Minister of Transport, noted that the project “will unite Britain”.
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was “awesome” from the prospect of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improving the railway capacity and reducing travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it's going to bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis on our railway network.
But it is also about urban transport; 18 cities across Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better informed by HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “amply” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of Great Britain to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow railway line, Edinburgh, already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Is Thorium a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to deliver energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require more space for generation.
Nuclear energy is wasted in the same way, but it leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists drew attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleiev system.
It meets all over the world, and experts claim that its fragmentation does not leave waste that must be preserved for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the flight mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required US airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in effect in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, he said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of the use of its entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the controller.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the Spokesman said.
Qantas stated that it would follow the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study carefully the decision of the FAU and its causes.
For U.S. carriers, the influence of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airline.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, manual and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the fragility of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude,” said the FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, as recommended by the group, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head is heard in the Cuban anthem of extremes
The football match between Angie and Kubanju broke out in political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the sick burned down the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban anthem sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramadan Abdulatypov on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for inter-national strife, in particular calling for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, which was approved in 1995.
It's a disgrace, and no one does.
"Thinking of you here, as the mother of your mother, as the enemy, as the bashurman we are going to the death battle" - why such words should be recorded in the hymn, and that of others who believe in other believers, " - expressed solidarity with the Abdulatip President of the Parliament of Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, that is, from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck at Russian-produced rockets that were reportedly intended for Hizbollah.
Syria has today fulfilled an important condition to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached with the mediation of Russia that allowed the United States not to conduct a military operation that they had made in full this summer.
More details about weapons and what this means to the Syrian President will be told by our international chief correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of toxic gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Assad's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today, it's an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn the declared chemical manufacturing plants.
The longer-term and harder task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were considered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate, and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
Its opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat with leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped the penalty of mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves to death, it is not easy for his mother to avoid being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's holding on.
And it changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation established a separate Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Construction
Russian President Vladimir Putin set up a new ministry responsible for construction and ZCH and proposed to lead his ex-governor of Ivanov Region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mene at the Novo-Ogrevo residence, and Menn did not refuse to head the new department.
Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary explained that all construction and construction functions and the ZCX were transferred to the new Ministry from the Minregion.
Mikhail Men, son of renowned Orthodox priest of Protoyere Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleums in the name of Gubakin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun, he has been elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergio-Posad region, he has been a deputy of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, and he has been the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was Governor of Ivanov Region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawnshop in Bendemir, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga places a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that the ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, has become the third pawnbroker registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Loans for jewelry are not only a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling) but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, pawnbrokers usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered in the United Overseas Bank office, a local creditor with a branch in the same trading centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness checks or wage evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnshops because families are under pressure because of the cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans fuelled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for income reductions as their economies slow down.
During this week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in family credit, mainly due to an increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80% of GDP to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“The fact is, with prices rising, people in the middle and bottom [stacks of income] will be looking for ways to fill their income wherever they can, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist CIMB, Malaysian Bank.
Recordly high gold prices over the past two years have increased the urgency with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items placed at 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's bet the gold chain of grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of EasyMoney pawnbrokers has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million that was attracted this week as a result of the placement of shares in the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have caused criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that Lombard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Clients set up items they already own, and the monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt”, she said.
The wage earns an increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
In doing so, pawnbrokers are not limited to those categories of people who are in a difficult financial position.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices to install gold alloys or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy people who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of medical facilities available and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
The 2011-2013 Tulle Health Modernization programme, the restructuring of our city's medical facilities, will enable the establishment of an optimal health-care structure for the population, including gynaecological, pregnant and newborn.
For example, there was an even greater opportunity after the merger with the hospice to attract narrow specialists from the GHS “NGKB” to consult pregnant people with different pathologies, to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistics base of the maternity home was significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards was developed.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major renovations, and 112 units of equipment have been purchased for 42 million roubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, the Caesarean section uses a Sell-Saver device to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment return its birth, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinic-laboratory diagnostic unit.
An electronic register is in place in the women ' s consultation, and electronic maps and patient history are planned soon.
The development of telemedicine has enabled the consultation of gynaecological patients, pregnant women, births and newborns with regional professionals.
Chechens beat up and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March of this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasus.
The bandits reportedly ordered a prostitute to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat them up and robbed them.
The gang leader was a formerly convicted Chechnya worker, 27 years old.
Bavarian defender David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting on the official Bundesligi website.
In this dispute, he outran representatives of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second took place by the foothillsman Marcel Hirscher, and the third one by the ski jumper from the trampoline Gregor Schlerencauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigeria national helped his team win the League of Champions, the German Champions and the German Cup, as well as in the UEFA Super Bowl.
Ex-wife of Archawin is resting with actor Andre Chad
The former civilian wife of a football player, Peter "Zenita" Andrey Arshavin, Yulia Baranovska, is taking a vacation with actor Andre Chad.
Julia rests in Italy at the company of actresses Anastasia Zadrožna, her groom is the figureist Sergey Slavnova, and the actor Andrea Chadova.
The photos of the couples' joint walks are published in the Instagram of the Road Anastasia.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, Zadrožna published a picture of a couple standing on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, Andrew Arshavin admitted to living separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovska and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
Recently, it was known that Archawin was dating an ex-model named Alice Kasmina.
Archawin's new friend was married to the corporate top manager.
A $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million bailout package for a weakened Tasmanian health system will be complemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not spend any money in vain.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pliebersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island ' s population, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The decision to finance was made within four years following consultations of the Government with the independent Tasmanian deputy, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state”, Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics receiving non-pre-recorded patients in Hobart and London to improve the quality of post-patient care, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will focus on advanced doctors’ ideas on how to better help Tasmania’s health system,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania should work in strict reporting and accountability.
The State would need to maintain the current level of funding to obtain the Commonwealth ' s money and report monthly on where it spent the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkey said today that $325 million would not solve anything “if not followed by a genuine reform that would place Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he commended the Government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the withdrawal of this state’s health system from critical condition,” said Mr. Wilke.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent reductions.
But the Federal Health Opposition Representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to that of the leukoplast. ”
“The reason we are here is that the Labour Government of the State has ripped $430 million out of the health system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening of the Giom Niklu novel by Danny Didro may boast exceptional art and historical details, but it is also more difficult to see than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to her family's monastery.
When she starts to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist superintendent and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down until it's too late or too sensational, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risks becoming a test of hairstyles and audiences.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons, says the monitoring group
Syria destroyed the main chemical weapons and ammunition production equipment with toxic gas, an international monitoring group declared on Thursday, while violent clashes erupted in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by the organization based in The Hague, to destroy or “do not work” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix toxic gas chemicals and to fill their ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria is no longer able to produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and zarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during Thursday ' s fierce fighting in Safira, where experts believe that the chemical weapons facility and its storage sites are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights.
A group of activists, which monitored losses through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
The Government stated that 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Hezbollah Lebanese fighters.
Also among the victims, according to the statement, there were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Asada troops fought in Safir for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on Thursday from both sides but did not provide specific data.
The Boi stressed the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team “is now satisfied that it has checked and seen destroyed all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/filling declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, “the abandoned and... items of the chemical weapons programme contained therein have been moved to other designated sites which have been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safir was one of the two places the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the Ahmet Uzumju Monitoring Group in the commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, civil war has been facing the rebels, mostly the Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alavit sect, the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the PDP site in the coastal province of Latakia.
The reason for the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger at the conviction of the organizers of the Bali terror
The 202 survivors and relatives who died as a result of the Bali bombing in 2002 responded furiously to the sentence handed down by the last of the conspirators before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The track, which spent almost 10 years in the run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for its role in the creation of explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if parole is granted.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including a wave of church explosions throughout Indonesia during Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life expectancy, although they might insist that a person called a “smack” for his reputation as an explosive device maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of mother Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Only by holding back her tears did she say that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must be in front of the firing squad,' said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device installed in a parked van outside was launched immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack made of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma three times a month, being connected to the life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell, responsible for the bloodbath, namely Amroza, Muhlas and Imam Sawise, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not much.
The trail is the last of the participants in the Bali attack brought before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed former Al-Qaida head Usama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in an attempt to restore links between South-East Asia terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
“He hasn’t given up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much he had caused others.
The verdict was given in advance of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Mrs. Cortin.
The path may still appeal its verdict.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use boyfriends on airplanes (but not from mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
How quickly such a change is taking place will vary depending on the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wehrt at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they update their flight crew training manuals and device layout rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Despite the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAU.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, clipboards and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices once the aircraft is down and not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and roll-off, the FAA stated.
Most new airlines and other aircraft modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling “school duty” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection for surfing, e-mailing, text messages or data download will still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, clipboards and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Words with Friends” — an intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a dramatic incident occurred: an actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device at the time of his departure.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be stored in the luggage compartment because they can traumatize someone if they fly all over the salon.
Cell phone calls on the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, the national transport security expert CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“The cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interferences for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can create interferences for cellular communications when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by the FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years there has been increased pressure on the FAUs to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the senator-democrat of Missouri, Claire McKaskil, claim that there are no compelling security reasons for bans.
Observance of restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to limit the use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech boyfriends of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Wi-Fi modified aircraft are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Wehrt.
Today ' s electronic devices typically emit radio signals far lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic-book-readers, for example, only emit minimum page-reading signals.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices upload or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded a whole airliner with their own e-book reader, Kindle, and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passenger Association, said that he considered interference from the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could create disruptions to aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during installation in limited visibility.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourism Industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sound step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the United States Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving licence examinations
Driver ' s licenses will be open to private companies with their own computerized highway.
This is referred to by Kommersant, referring to the Government's draft regulation “On Admission to Driving”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such highways in Russia.
It is expected that students of such “privileged” automobile schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State inspection will monitor the passing of examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the course are not passed for the first time, this school will be denied six months of privileges.
The technical requirements for highways contained in the Government's draft regulation shall enter into force as from 5 November 2014.
The project also includes requirements for the training of two-wheeled equipment.
As from 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the urban test to obtain category A rights.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to take foreign-righted drivers to work.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transferred by air to a safe place from a drilling facility in the North Sea is released back into the wild
A bird that was flown to the shore after being found in an exhausted state in an oil rig in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed on a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month and then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) in the rescue center in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This waterherder is likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It appears that the bird has hanged and was able to find refuge in an oil rig.
He added, “She was unable to take off again, so they asked us for help.”
The herd of water was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and jobs create in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad business in Britain by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are lagging behind.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a common dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the trade zone of Europe, even 40 per cent of large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies agreed.
Last and most illustrative, our survey of business leaders found that the obvious majority wanted Britain to take the course of treaty change and trade-based relations with the EU, not politics.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “significant change” that will restore power back to Britain.
The stakes are high - achieving treaty changes and more favourable conditions for Britain will result in a 16 per cent vote in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister has no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the conditions of British EU membership.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces towards Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' normative activities.
U.S. Special Forces are listening to Pope Roman's personal phone.
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the American Special Forces.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence has been listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now very much in charge of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of election of the new pope was also monitored.
What was particularly important in the United States?
The task force joined the cell phones of the cardinals gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the conclave lived were also answered.
The American spies listened to all the main candidates on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an unwelcome figure on Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the U.S. Big Ear continued to intercept the prelates until the completion of the conclave on 12 March.
In the United States, it is claimed that since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been awarded as the future Pope of Rome.
American intelligence has also followed negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Bank of the Vatican.
The Italian Journal states that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives who obtain information on policies and financial flows continues to operate in the United States Embassy.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully declared that it is not concerned with the American bug, even if it is.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets from the Holy Fathers.
The snowboarder was specially photographed for the Olympic Coupon
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
Nominal bills are 100 rubles.
But on the web, bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorabilia.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Coupon on 30 October, they pointed out that the picture of the snowboarder from the banknote could be found in the photobanks.
In particular, the Free StockExchange photo store, which dates back to 2005.
The same photograph is used in a photoshop lesson published on the Russian Megaview website on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used to advertise RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote was executed in a blue and blue game.
On the one hand, there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, a kind of Olympic stadium and Jar-patica.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the contest among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts called Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered, such as mountain skiing, freestyle and trampling, but eventually they chose snowboarding as a relatively young sport.
According to a source of “Reports”, close to the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public regarding the wide dissemination of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is currently studying the situation.
In Goznak, they are not too concerned about the noise surrounding the Olympic banknote.
Press director Gosznak Natali Nikiforov stated to the Notices that all discussions about plagiarism were ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note turned right, in the photos on the web - left, - said Nikiforova.
The man in the photo session to create the bill was removed from different points, then the final image was chosen, and it was characteristic of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, since the artist had been paid for his work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the image in the Olympic Coupon was positive and positive.
The recognition of the image on the coupon - plus for its promotion - is considered by the Executive Director of the PN "Rus Brand" Aleksei Popovicev.
It is difficult to prove the 100 per cent similarity of images on the coupon and in the photobanks, so claims to challenge intellectual property on the image are unlikely to be made.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China, a commemorative 10-Yuan note to the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their perceptions, beer consumption in the country will remain at the same level next year, at best.
Although the businessmen originally expected growth.
This year, they fail: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest beer companies, President of the Russian Beers Union Council, Isaac Sheps, spoke of this at the III annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith, “Foods of Daily Demand in Russia”, which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 per cent, as there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in recent years with regard to the production and trafficking of beer, a small alcoholic beverage, sheps told the audience.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified in the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewery visited that many of the legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, however, all new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The beer producers were more affected by the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
For next year, brewers have two projections.
Optimistic is the one Sheps spoke about: the sale of a penny will be maintained at the same level.
Pessimistic - 2-3 per cent will fall.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen have to move away from mass-consumer varieties to premium class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
In the meantime, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
“It is my understanding that the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said Dr. Alexie Sotnikov, a medical doctor.
True, the proportion of sick people who use heavy drinks, as well as those who drink spirit drinks like Jaguar, has grown, whereas ten years ago, it was "beer" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford car factory in Vevlologsk.
As they say in trade unions, all dismissed persons were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is much more pressing than the problems of workers.
Deputy Provincial ZachSa Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that about 600 people had been reduced in the Ford factory in Vjevoložsk.
According to him, this happened in September, when about 600 people left the factory under a voluntary dismissal programme developed with the organization's trade union.
Workers who decided to resign themselves were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
But, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna limit it.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficulty," he explained, adding that when the budget was adopted, the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large decrease in employment.
In the Ford, this information is neither denied nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it does, we'll have to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in Vevoložsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company ' s plans to fire 600 people were known in September.
The plant had previously claimed that the production of cars had been suspended.
The decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia was cited as the reason for the factory.
According to Petrostat, as a result of nine months 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasta decreased by 5.4 per cent.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones will be available during take-off and landing
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of aircraft are approved in the United States, according to BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and new rules will be in force by the end of 2013.
However, the Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of disruption of aircraft radio equipment, the 100th voice communication will continue to be banned.
Airplane passengers are thus allowed to read electronic books, play board games and other boyfriends and watch video during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobiles on aviation technology and aircraft control equipment.
According to the source, for example, Britain will also be able to review existing standards for the use of electronic devices on flights.
The "Russian Mafia" in the U.S. has finally established a new name, "Brother Circle."
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian Mafia” in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the "Brath Circle".
One Russian singer, Gregory Leps, was suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In the US blacklist, there are 22 people involved in the "Brother Circle" and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
“The 'Brother Circle' statement is more about trying to unite divided criminal groups”, formerly said the organized crime expert and New York University Professor Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the Brotherly Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian mafia.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who confirms the existence of such a criminal organization,” said Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization”, the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted her as saying.
Mark Galeotti suggested in the middle of last year that the "Brother Circle" unites more closely the Russian thief in the Aslan Usoyan law known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, Lashi Shushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, had a close connection with Dead Hassan, and another participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, had a nephew for Grandpa Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all more united in common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which has led to such a decision as to why he was placed on such lists, said the Spokesperson of the Head of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is an RF citizen.
Like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Gazprom head Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new gas era
The start of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russian export routes through Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas intended for Europe, increases the risk for normal routes, officials say.
Miller stated that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at reduced prices as soon as the whole project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Saratsk region, a car driver, Peugeot, took the 115-km route of Odessa-Reni and encountered a bus with six people.
This is reported by the HHS Press Service in the Odessa region.
As a result of the incident, 31-year-old Peugeot car driver died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were killed, and his leg was crushed.
The doctors gave the woman the first medical care on the spot, and she refused to be hospitalized.
All other passengers were also examined by ambulance personnel.
With the help of the crane, rescuers picked up a bus and released a bus driver whose leg was stuck at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned.
Two NSW YMCA staff members were charged with sexual crimes against children prior to the indictment in 2011 against a child-care worker in Karingbah, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's opening statement stated that it “never dealt with sexual violence against children within its organization”.
Chief Executive Officer Philippe Hayr was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another when an instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Fernance, a lawyer who was assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in its opening speech to the Commission, had also allowed impreciseness, arguing that “there had been external YMCA checks, which recognized that YMCA was in the front lines of child safety”.
The evidence provided by the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second one from the end of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who had joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower leadership had missed the appointment of the Lord and had not been able to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations regarding the reported violations of children ' s security policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys for two years of his work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord in the field of child security.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, had personally cared for them, had put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them, and had allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Owell, who was led by the Lord and asked to train her to protect the children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, the guardian of the children of the YMCA office in Karingbah, who was the leader of the Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to reach”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from the staff that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the idea of informing him.
Mr. Hare said that he had submitted to the New South Wales Board of YMCA his view that the lesson for the organization of the Jonathan Lord incident was not “related to the provision of information” by staff members, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the charges was taken by the Director-General of YMCA for the custody of the children, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the distortion of evidence, but that it was “retired” and that the decision was not implemented properly.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-friendly organization during the 2009-2011 Jonathan Lord's work, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University reported to the Commission on the issue of child rearing.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearings were adjourned until 20 December.
Fashion week in São Paulo.
She's considered not just a model, but a real star.
Although Giselle Bundschen had for a while left her job as a mother, she came in on a special occasion during these days and this week.
Her absence for months did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's most highly paid supermodel.
This time, she was in the defile of the "Colchchi" brand.
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
It's like a stylist named Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of a luxury pre-port, the modeler has been active in theatre and cinema, creating spectacles and costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and fashion world participated in the final week of fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic areas of production, with more than 2 million Brazilians in it, and an annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said that he would take the opportunity to return as Prime Minister of Britain, but acknowledged that return was unlikely.
A 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation the night before.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East Peacekeepers.
Responding to a question as to whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, reported in London's Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but that will hardly happen, so ...”
Major coach Milano Massimiliano Allegrey regretted the result of the 10th round of Italy's Lacio Championship.
The specialist also noted that failures at the start were due to a series of injuries from leading players.
I'm very sorry we didn't win, Tmw says Allegry.
The team played a good game, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let anything happen to Lacio.
In the second Romans, I was added, but in general, I cannot say that we lost our concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we met the challenge of joining the League of Champions.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of traumas from key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the sporting events coming to Cardiff to fight for the prize of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, who had taken his first steps, the young man and his pal Shetland pony Toffi ran three tours in order to easily take the prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — the same growth — was commended for their appearance, behavior, and style at the annual competition held by the Sannibenko Horse Sports Centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
Taking a general view of men and women in fancy hats, he lifted his cap and proudly spent two years in Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability to handle horses for years.
Toffi was highly rated for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he's been dealing with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make a wonderful duet."
They had many rivals, but the two left with a golden cup and a rosary.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb-Vale in South Wales, follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was struck, and everyone was shouting approving voices and chattering.”
He ran all over the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the start, he will soon be in the Badlands of the Year, and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of the annual horse show said: “Fenton only three years, but he knows how to treat his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves in the show.
They assess the consistency of the performance of the pony and the manufacturer — Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, and he really looked at it well.
The Chinese newspaper, which issued its appeal, “is subject to reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a first-track appeal for the release of the accused in the libel of a reporter, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper of Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of a journalist, Chen Yoonzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
The New Express must now undergo a “complete error correction process”, according to the regulator.
The “correction of errors” order came from the Guandun administration in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
A preliminary investigation has shown that Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on Zoomlion's stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The management of the New Express was disoriented,” says the regulator.
He reported that it had been decided to “require Chen Junzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporting licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the newspaper's related situation and amend the New Express leadership immediately”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express”, in which he reported financial irregularities in the construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two appeals for his release in the first lane, claiming that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire media industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to the State Broadcasting Company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I was aware of my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen’s confession, the New Express issued an apology in the first lane, stating that the newspaper had not been able to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China continues to be widespread despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from coercing anyone into self-recrimination.
United States Tunnel — Mexico for the Transport of Drugs, equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been found.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, with its zigzag length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with undetected warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, according to the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major passageway found in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which posed a challenge to drug cartels for the rapid delivery of their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with rail routes, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions in Belarus have been increasing since November
Pensions have been increased in Belarus since November of this year, and correspondent BELTA has been informed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection's Directorate General of Pensions.
As of 1 November this year, adjustments will be made to the average wage of workers in the Republic applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and a corresponding recalculation of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the Retirement of Pensions.
As a result of the recalculation from November, employment pensions by age are estimated to increase by 5.3 per cent on average.
The average age pension will be No. 2 million 295,000.
Retirement of pensions affects 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus will increase its pension payments to EUR274.3 billion per month from November of this year.
At the same time as the recalculation of employment pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplementary pensions will be recalculated due to an increase in the per capita subsistence budget.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of No. 1 million, 530 million, 2.1 per cent higher than that in force between 1 August and 31 October.
Accordingly, there will be an increase of 2.1 per cent from 1 November in the amount of minimum employment pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplementary pensions.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillions were established for pensions based on increases in 2013.
British police are handing over Assanja a notice of extradition
The British police today submitted a notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who hid at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had handed over a 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” to the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further subject to arrest.
Assanju is under threat of extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, on 19 June, he took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “offered a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station day and time of our choice”, the press secretary said.
It continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to present him with possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic dispatches on the WikiLeaks website against secrecy.
Driver driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howe of Tiptry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink between his legs.
In Kolchester Howe's world court, he admitted the charge of driving without due care and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven penalty points resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie has also pledged to pay the costs of £90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners will result in a London bubble bursting.
The Treasury had carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital tax, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who had introduced a government duty rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to own houses in association rather than as individuals.
At present, housing in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, is already in excess of the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamburg combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase in the duty on expensive houses and the introduction of related anti-removal legislation, it is very difficult to claim that tax on expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate — up from 5 to 10 per cent of the priced housing market — in London’s rich south-west belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen to 11.8 per cent in the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a sustained growth of 5.6 per cent year-on-year, but they were eclipsed by an active “domestic market” with rising prices in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are associated with its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs stick their tail to the right (dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs swing their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see these fine differences in tailing and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right side of the brain are involved differently in the formation of inducers who cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at that and other species.
He added that just like a human, dogs have the right part of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the various tailings of other dogs, researchers watched animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes to the other.
Professor Valortigara said: “We showed dogs video — either naturalistic versions or silhouette — to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right. ”
When the animals saw that nothing in the rest of the dog’s expression moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the elf tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was mostly to the left (the base from the point of view of the dog’s tail), their heartbeat was increasing and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and which they do not.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and often their tailing is related to more friendly behaviour, and the right side is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of their animal’s emotions.
The expert on dog behaviour, John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to see if dogs were relevant to the left and right.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
In another scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog when shedding its tail was directed to the left than to the right instead of becoming alarmed — the opposite of Italian research.”
He said that differences could have been due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or dog robots as dogs.
It might be helpful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for the various mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior may be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys is putting off a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The bossfield group was scheduled to perform at the city concert site of Hydro on Friday.
However, a vocalist named Alex Turner made them move the show.
This statement was made by the group after it was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to sleep for the first time during his service on 22 February, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who choose the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once he has reached the age of 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope, the prerogative of the 120 “Cardinal voters”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Constituent, would be held before the Sanhedrin ceremony.
“Dad Francis decided to report in advance on his decision to convene a consortium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Votes said that the number of electoral cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually called as many cardinals as he needed to bring the number of electorate cardinals back to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
The story next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of France in March of this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and particularly in favour of Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if a new cardinal pope would appoint from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation by the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made up his own mind.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “possible” that France would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in that situation for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually appointed cardinal of the bishops of large incomes, but Francis “plenty of surprises — that is why we do not know who he will call”.
GM calls off a number of new pickups in the U.S. to complete seatbacks
General Motors Co responds to almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra model 2014 pickups to solve problems with manual seat-back adjustment, according to a notification submitted Friday by the U.S. regulatory authorities in the area of road safety.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal standards for the safety of motor vehicles under head restraints.
“In the rear impact of the vehicle, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Traffic Safety Administration website.
The withdrawn models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The release of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important start-up for a leading American auto-producer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notification to owners due to the 16-day suspension of the Government ' s work, which had reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups of Silverado and 16,503 pickup trucks of Sierra.
GM shares in the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama’s electorate
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructiveism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health system website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a secondary student at Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book was going to cheer me up at the time of my disunity in medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It is called “The Obstinacy of Victory”, and it is a memoir of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama.
When I finish my reports on my patients and go to bed at night, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and the speeches could capture the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programmes took a pause to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At Obama's entry into office in 2008, its level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Back to the present is a rude awakening, like a dream pull.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, the killing of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and peers, I had finished explaining what I could provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission of foreign leaders or the use of drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of disclosure agents that expose the Government ' s misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar Al-Awlaki, without trial and investigation, or the failure to comply with State funding and expenditure limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
In recent years, it has been unable to justify the fact that it has not been possible to develop a simple website within more than three years of the signing of the Act on Available Medical Care.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was so enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and harsh alternative, and he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I had hoped that within my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard of for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, it was much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
It makes me miss the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to regain our attractiveness," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It has been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of child-care leave.
Billionaire Deputy Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and benefit from it.
This coal-mining tycoon, which has an outstanding dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he was trying to avoid questions as to whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the elimination of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have been with the ministers and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally be the winner of political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters becomes pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they will receive leave,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the battle for the seat of the Fairfax constituency of Sanshine-Cost, 53 votes after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting procedure in the elections to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Francis and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after we have voted?
“We need a more perfect system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system like this so we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote and get a result at 6:30 that same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for markings in ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use pencils in our time.
The Electoral Commission was exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Costa and would be “very serious” about his new work.
The public position involves the service of society.
“We are not seeking any rewards other than the thanks of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange office, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another indication that the global audit by regulators of alleged foreign exchange manipulations is rapidly gaining turnover.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff to be removed during the unfolding investigation, which coincides with the LIBOR interbank rate manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on the removals, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other regulators”, the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted the e-mail and instant messaging records that had been received and sent by its former trader to the UK Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, has left the RBS in 2010 and is aware of his current position as head of European spot exchange in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot tenders in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
The instant messaging group of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six of the world’s regulators — the European Commission, Finland, the antitrust body of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are considering allegations that bankers have contracted to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal checks or have received requests for information from regulatory authorities, according to the persons familiar with the situation.
Banks examine instant messaging and e-mails in a few years in the search for offences.
The audit reports have raised traders in recent years as one of the largest sources of income for investment banks trading units, which, however, has encountered difficulties this year owing to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favourable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily foreign exchange bids, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the London Stock Exchange traders this week after causing losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has today ruled that Barack Obama ' s health trademark law is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama ' s administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate orders under the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Health, requiring citizens to acquire medical insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act that the states improve compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally enforceable.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed a motion to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Soccer is the reason for the difference?
In Gosduma, in the Open Court, politicians and experts discussed how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the banning of football in the North Caucasus because of scandals and discords.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled recent developments in Biruleva and said that, in order to reduce the “grade of tension in society”, policies and the media must be corrected in their statements.
He was probably referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinski, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with a thorny wire in one of the TV shows if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and of measures to harmonize relations between the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to discussions of sombreness.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Biruleva were “a model conflict that could be predicted”, but “we have too many people and authorities responsible for these issues” and seven have no eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced against migrants has failed, according to the public, and must seek its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
“There is still a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that they live for people in Dagestan and vice versa”, he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed criminalizing "calls for Russia's dismemberment": "If you say in the United States on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinski tried very hard not to start.
As usual, he accused journalists who bring ill and acute national problems to public debate: "In the dust of controversy, is there anything to be said!"
The leader of the “One Russia” faction Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised journalists to conclude a “paper” and agree to conduct discussions on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that placed regional and municipal authorities with responsibility for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko was not thrilled about the law: it had no “clear idea of what the adaptation of migrants was, of its mechanisms and limits.
Thus, actors will treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the resources necessary to deal with such complex issues, there is no means, and the methodical recommendations they could use do not have the centre...
The head of the Nationalities Committee of thought, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerius Tishkov, who headed a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, who could be approached if anything.
“We are walking along the edge, the shells are being torn apart, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak out against provocations together, and this work must be given decent information support”, said the representative of the RPC on relations with society, Vyvod Chaplin.
No State's neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, religious ones, including, in his view, should be.
Here Oleg Neelov brought the discussion to an unexpected conclusion: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan are still to be looked for, but they are not pushed on that path, not on that road," he said.
"Not the road" is football development: "The football player beats the shit out of the crowd, and the flags burn, and the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another kind of sport called regby...
"There will be no equal in the world in this form of sport!"
No one will play the Caucasus in regby! - Mr. Girinowski intervened immediately.
You're going to offer them more kerlings!
You need to know the national features, it's like Georgia's Zaporezec to propose...
In Jaroslavle, there was a difference between the Moscow Club and the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFC Monitoring and Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigoriantz, reported that Kuban was fined 500,000 roubles, handed over by Philippa PAPENKOV, an SE correspondent from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Red Cross Club were applied to the flag of Dagestan by the hospital in the rostrum during the 14th round home game against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the FPF.
We have examined all available materials.
Cuban is fined 500,000 rubles for the misconduct of the viewers.
Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims filed against Nortel
A group of thousands of former Nortel patents filed a series of patents against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including a Google company whose price was broken at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed patent infringements at the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key words of Internet search with their respective advertising, according to the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones working on the Android operating system from Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this deal the determining factor was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents at auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar claims increased damages from Google because he claims that the violation of patent rights by Google is deliberate, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first elected President takes an oath
Muhammad Mursey takes an oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursey promised “new Egypt” when he took an oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,” said Mursey during a solemn ceremony on public television.
“Today’s Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursey, a 60-year-old American engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years has been a banned organization that has served as a target for the harsh actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursey arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the Presidential pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to pass his convoy along a normally lively road connecting the city's centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursey was ridiculed as a non-charistic “supply wheel” of Brotherhood, his personal prestige had risen sharply since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself not only as a candidate for Islamists but also all those who wanted to bring the case of the 2011 Rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak to an end.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, dressed in a blue business costume with a red tie, to the judges in the packed wooden panels of the hall where he took an oath.
Later, Mursey went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing a public anthem, during which he stood “moderately”.
There was a military officer named Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and the People — One Hand”, which chanted hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture room of the University.
Founded in 1908 as a fence of secular education, the University of Cairo became a confluence of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Murci took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a rebellion broke out in the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year and promised to restore the power of the President, whose office had been denied by the military council, who had taken action against the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, not before parliament, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursey’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tumena Region Engineering Association was held at the Yalutorov Motor Plant.
The event presented a new line for the production of steel electric pipes.
According to commercial director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the market for steel construction in Tumensk region was conducted in 2011 with the new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electricity pipelines per month.
It was then decided to change the factory profile and to install equipment for their production.
Already this year more than 7,000 tons of produced products have been shipped.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles, according to Dennis Gribanov.
A new state was launched in October, allowing for an increase in the range.
The factory produces both a small pipeline profile, which is used for heating, small construction and furniture industries, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to produce 50,000 tons of products per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now 157, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is retraining and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new long-sharp aggregate of up to five millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of products as well as another state, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company was about to produce pipes used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise is tasked with closing up up up to 70 per cent of the Tumensk needs for the products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, advised production managers to pay greater attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This includes forms of State support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on credits for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year, 150 million roubles are earmarked for this purpose and two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission to consider grant treaties accepts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provides for 150 million roubles that can be used to compensate for leasing payments and credits for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million to energy saving programmes.
There is a decrease of 72 million roubles for the requisition of ordered and paid equipment produced in the south of the Tumen area for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonidas Ostroumov, this form of support will end in the future, as the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies had paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expendable obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government considers the area to be a priority for the direct support of industrial enterprises, not the financing through them of the oil industry.
The budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented at work.
Many business managers expressed concern about the current situation in relation to oil.
The grant for their equipment is a competitive advantage of the South Tumenian industry, and it will be difficult to compete at a price with the average Russian workforce, where it is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the succession of the new owner of the TNC-WR, Rosneft, who has not yet placed his orders in the Tumen enterprises is unclear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uwatska Project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
Currently, southern enterprises that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil mined in the Uwatsk region will come into the region ' s budget or will be paid at the site of registration of the new owner of the land.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist role in the social network
The Lenin district court of Tomska sentenced the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, which placed an extremist video on the social network, RIA Novosti reported on Friday to the district court press.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his website on a popular social network, which was placed on the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code, “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of the dignity of the person committed publicly”.
“The Leni district court considered the case in a special way and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by sentencing him in the form of 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the Agency’s interlocutor.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of prices of goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country's prices will decrease significantly once the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
That's what he said when he spoke to his readers on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will fall significantly.
And that would mean that prices should go down.
“This is about the goods that come from EU countries,” wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be mediated.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared sufficiently in our country, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, is not quite so, or more precisely - not at all," Azarov summed up.
Investigators verify information on child abuse in Biaska
On 29 October, the media reported that a teacher of one of the children ' s gardens in the city of Biska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently ascertaining all the circumstances, as well as the legal evaluation of the activities of the children ' s kindergarten staff.
After the charge of stupidity, Eugenia Vasilieva spoke.
Eugenia Vasiliev, to whom close media attention has been attached for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press, both about theft in the Ministry of Defence and about it personally, relations with the ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdukov, its poetry and its passion for valuable things.
On 1 November, however, the Defence Service figure broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, she said: “Of course, the task was exactly the same: to extract any negative information from me regarding the former Minister of Defence.”
There's been blackmailing me into testifying, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We'll continue to go to court, prove our innocence.
In victory, we are 100 per cent certain.
In doing so, it can be concluded from the interview that perhaps Vassilieva was most impressed by the fact that she did not care about her taste.
It is likely that there is a statement made by the official representative of the SC, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by the Defence Service figure was falsified.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the mistress, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap forgeries," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasiliev.
On the question of whether she admits her guilt in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vasileva stated: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC RF that Vasilieva is shying away from studying the criminal case, the author's lawyer stated that he and his client were “not allowed to know the material of the case”.
What has led to the discovery of Vasileva, who has not yet spoken to the press, under house arrest?
Maybe how could a woman not answer the charges of bad taste?
Or the right journalists of Komsomolka, who claimed a few days ago that she had “fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of reports of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdukov with his wife and his return to the family?
A prominent military observer, Victor Baranec, in his article “Serdukov has returned to his wife?” wrote: “Followers do not rule out that after such an earthquake she may become more talkative during interrogations.”
In the past, Vasiliev has been charged with the illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defence.
It's old-fashioned.
What needs to be done in the garden before the freezing begins
In the autumn, it is best to choose honey products from fungicides, such as the 1% onboard mixture or Abigail-Pik, Oxych, Ordan, etc.
Do you think the tourists have left in the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its forecast for the full year and looks forward to a record income from vacationers in Australia and Britain.
The tourist firm now expects its main full annual income to be from $325 million to $340 million, compared to its previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks were achieved, this would be 12-17 per cent growth compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent in the first half of the year and had started the second half with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and Britain.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high profit before the deduction of interest and tax contributions in the full year,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business in the second half of the year recovered, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, the British business Flight Centre was doing well in the field of leisure, while corporate clients were spending less.
Her business in the U.S. compensated for the losses suffered during the season of the weak first half of the year and is expected to win a third full year in a row.
Yesterday the Flight Centre stock grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police identified two gaming halls.
He was the first to work in the Industrial Region on the Affordable Street.
At the moment of checking in the institution, there was a game.
There were 24 machine guns at the club.
Another game club was found in Leninsky district on Anton Petrova Street.
This is where 20 slot machines were used.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared under the heading “Illicit organization and gambling”.
The technique was taken away.
The evidence will soon be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin regions of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who has dealt severely with two sisters.
They burned their bodies after they were killed.
As reported to the “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, two women's bodies were found in a three-bedroom apartment on Uralska Street on the day following the end of the fire in the Kirov region.
Soon the identities of the victims were established.
It was found that these were sisters, one of whom was a resident of Ekaterinburg for 44 years, and the other was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
They took off the burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was personally monitored by the main police region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities process various versions of the murder, verify the alibis of previously tried citizens and those who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is determined for what purpose women have rented an apartment and where they have lived before they have worked, with whom they have maintained relations.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also include “non-programme texts” to encourage broader reading.
The combined English literature and language course will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate language examination, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to issue new English and Mathematics training programmes tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure of secondary school examinations, with a new evaluation system and a lower volume of course work.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Howe said that “a broad consensus had been reached that we should reform our examination system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduation examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
While there would be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, the coalition sources said that large-scale school math examinations, combined with a higher rate in the ratings table, would likely be an incentive for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Heiha tickets will cost tourists 2,200 roubles
As of tomorrow, tourists from Blagoveštensk in Heihe will begin to ride on the airbag.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra costs.
The ticket to the puma is traditionally much more expensive than the fare.
According to AmuraASO's reference service, the cost of a normal ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It will cost 2,800 roubles to pass through the comfort hall.
As a matter of fact, this season, the tickets did not travel: at the same price, the mountain lion drove tourists and the last spring, and a year ago, in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that the rate of growth of her GDP is insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, says Reuters.
We planned an increase in GDP in the area of 3 per cent this year, perhaps even a little more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of the recession in a number of countries in Europe, it might not be bad, but for us it is not bad, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in fact, for it to develop, there must be a higher pace.
It is now very important that Russian companies, the Russian business, receive normal credit at a normal price, is the first thing to do," the head of the Government stressed.

Travel on mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free rural health care in Cameroon
Bwellle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are not many doctors — only one in 5,000
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to make him the hero of CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and regain consciousness by wandering around hospitals that were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of herself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said George Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, for years he accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave home at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them wouldn't have had it in their pocket.
Two out of five people in the country are living below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the expenditure on health care is private.
“The only problem is poverty,” said Bwell.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vessel surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are loaded into vans, tied to roofs by medical supplies and traveled across the country to visit the needy villages.
They don't always have luck.
More than once, they had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they're met like real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that local people can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwellle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the joy.
The next morning, the brigade is starting to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” said Bwell.
They come from all over the county within 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of medical services on the weekends.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive churches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually conducted in a school building, a municipality or a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to free room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitation of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is a slow pace, but the team’s commitment to supporting village musicians is usually helpful.
“They beat the drums all night so we can stay awake and work,” said Bwellle.
On Sunday, the crew returned to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those to whom they help.
One person explained that his free rodent treatment operation would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekend and hospital clinics, surgeon Bwellle also works nights at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second work that he said accounted for 60% of the financing of his non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell group.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have received at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” said O’Malley.
As a sophomore, you would never have gotten that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pays for Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwellle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill their promise to their father is to bring him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I’m doing this job,” said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to ease their pain.

Snowden agreed to testify to Merkel's wiretap.
Bundest official Hans-Christian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Office of the Attorney-General of the FRG on the possible wiretapping of the phone of the chancellor of Germany by the U.S. Special Forces.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knew a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal surrounding US spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US e-intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquis, at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, reported by the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administrations of the two countries will provide wide-ranging support and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, resulting in the signing of the protocol.
The Parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
“The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other to be reliable partners”, he said.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that, during the negotiations, the heads of the foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The turnover between Belarus and Turkey, in the view of the Minister, needs to be increased and brought to a level of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is an untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
All necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will also be created," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama rejects his comments on health care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama went to the fifth time yesterday regarding his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of termination of services from their providers, the Republicans have criticised the President in recent days for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some adjustments to his initial public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called a “resurrection in the news” on the termination of services, Obama called upon the Americans receiving those notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who purchase insurance on their own could be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the Law on Available Medical Care.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibellius, who oversees the implementation of the law on available medical care, said that the launch of the online sales site has been “disgustingly bad” since October.
"I am as upset and angry as anything," she said.
“I really want to restore your trust.”
The irritated Sibellius defended this phrase, which was caught by the microphone behind it to an assistant at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billy Long, a republican from Missouri State, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibellius to say why the “architator” of the available medical care law had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has denied media status for non-censorship defence
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to grant an invalid license for the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, which reads "Lenta".
Roscomnadzor insisted that the media status of the agency be deprived of the agency - systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent had been established: the court had considered it possible to close the media by effectively refusing to issue a contract.
What is "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the Agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been listed as one of the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the exclusive publications of the agencies has been (and are still) notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a large source base in various departments, it was also suggested that Natalia Chaplin's wife, Victor Cerkesov, was at the head of the project.
The role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear: it is most often referred to as “project manager”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Aphonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in federal media ratings, either by citation or by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of Russian media sites on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and the monthly audience is about 3 million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are the notes on Kremlin's helplessness in relation to Ukraine, the death of the soloist group "King and Shoot", the pogroms in the capital of Biruleva.
The “Rosbalta” conflict with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the Media Act came into force, prohibiting journalists from engaging in an uncensored defence.
The Board found the prohibited language in two videos published on the Agency’s website (Jigit of Krasnodar) and "Pussy Riot defiled the oil towers").
The other sides describe it differently.
Roskomnadzor charged Rosbalt with gross and systematic violations of the media law on the basis of the videos found and requested the Agency to obtain a licence.
Rosbalta stated that the claims of the department were wrong: firstly, the videos were not editorial material, secondly, the mother's words were disguised in them and, thirdly, were removed from the site immediately after the warning of the video.
Representatives of the Agency appealed Roscomnadzor ' s claims before the world court - and when Mosgorsud accepted Roscomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, as many as 25 world judges have not ruled in favour of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov, has been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles for every roll.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the hearing in Moshorsud, if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to invalidate the Rosbalta registration certificate by effectively denying the media status of the Agency.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this struggle.
The Agency was supported by the Gosduma deputies (an application signed by 26 deputies on 10 October by the Head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Jarov; the document was submitted at the initiative of the CRC).
The illegal closure was claimed by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vesevod Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Journalist Union, Pavel Gusev, and head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor's leadership even provided him with some assurance that the case would not come before the license was revoked.
The Rosbalt Court has shown that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is safer today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament of Damascus has been completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare war poisons for use, transferred by the BBC.
The destruction of the poisons themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack in the province of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from resting.
The next tower is mid-November: by this time OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They would be happy to advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if they were to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States of America believes that the attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached by the Russian mediation, destroy or put into non-working condition all capacity for the production of projectiles, toxic gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step must be to destroy the weapons already available to the Syrian Army.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, each-nave mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
Its destruction requires the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start agreeing on a timetable for action, which will take two weeks.
OPCW Chief of Field Operations Jerry Smith said that his inspectors “were personally monitoring the destruction of equipment”.
“They now have no possibility of further producing or mixing chemical weapons”, he said.
The OPCW statement stated that inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and had ascertained that the shell and poison plants had either been destroyed or were damaged.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection, according to the document, but equipment from there has been transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical infrastructure was “particularly difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time to celebrate it with the inspectors - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that the U.S. espionage “has gone unfavorably far”
John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the US tracking strategy by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases the U.S. spy “has gone unfavorably far”.
The Secretary also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” during Edward Snowden's loud exposure to NSA spy activities.
These leaks have put the United States Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open-ended government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually understood some of the things happening on autopilot, because this possibility already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, on 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases it has gone awry.
And the President is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of good motivation and that its tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is a world of radical extremism, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the crash of planes, the explosions of buildings and the killing of people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the chairman of the Senate's European Affairs Subcommittee said on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had interviewed members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to cease participation in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment of the Agency ' s monitoring of national security.
“For the sake of national security, it is really important for Europeans to remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Murphy, a first-time Democrat and chair of the Senate's International Relations Subcommittee in Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents made public by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Klapper defended spy activities against allies as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against this background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip to Congress this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the coming days.
He said the programme of travel was still under development.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some “best incentives” would also show some severity.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they had used for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect Europeans’ rights, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must go to these weekends in the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility with regard to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions, the influence of prison inmates will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions (NCCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
NNCs are public entities that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
Sergey Magnitsky and Leonidas Razvodjaev, the unrest in the Cope Colony - it is through the ONC that most resonant incidents are being reported behind the grid.
The fight between human rights defenders and lobbyists is aimed at controlling the ONC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of NCs, I proposed to make the selection of human rights experience a criterion.
"He was not accepted and formed lists without criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borschev, the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is the entire Russian human rights defenders working on prison issues.
He has drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The Council of the OP should vote in favour of the composition of the ONCs in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacancies, and competitions in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balkariya have not been able to organize owing to the lack of candidates.
The O.P. pledges to organize the award for vacancies.
ONC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borcheva, 11 human rights defenders and 9 rapists are currently on the seat of the Capital Commission, and the option of voting in the OP changes the ratio by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the committee.
Therefore, the new composition may be re-established by the representative of the Battle Brotherhood, Viacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the ONC for three years but never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that the forces, by appointing their chairman of the ONC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the force is coordinated by a member of the ONC Anton Cvetkov, who heads the Russian Officers, an organization that advocates the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies on tape," said RBC daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied lobbying for the promotion of any lists and said he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Tsvetkov, he didn't even care what list they're voting for in the O.P.
It is considered a form of pressure to publish Borch information.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned replacement of the leadership of the Chilean ONC.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's anti-copies.
In the Chamber of Public Affairs, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
On the other hand, Rostova-na-Donu can go from human rights defenders to rapists.
From the new lists, the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission was one of his opponents, although in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for his unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Russian Borschev commissions are considered “a place for Kopejsk”.
The Toloconnikova Hope disclosures did not affect ONC Mordovia, which is considered to be “strong”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new force and did not even accept documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Svanidze, told the RBC that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Pavel Gusev, said that he voted in favour because he liked the Moscow list proposed.
The UNC Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the FIN Research Institute, coordinated the preparation of the lists.
Grib told RBC daily that he did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and rapists and disagreed that the Commissions ' chairpersons had sufficient authority to impede the work of its members.

Australian woman appeals against prison terms in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in a prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed her sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bumford was initially convicted on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court guilty of filing a false complaint following the Thai police report that a local taxi driver carried out an attack on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men detained her.
However, video surveillance cameras later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bumford for two days before she admitted that she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, it was held in local police cells.
Bampford was sentenced to 15 hours in prison at the general detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about their daughter's well-being and awaited her return to Australia.
“It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bampford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 bats.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently vacationing in the Kraby resort area in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bumford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence of up to two years and would force her to serve in an adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its ruined tourist image, which will lead to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris to present his novel Eltisheva, translated into French.
Remember, this novel was the finalist of four awards: Clear Plains, Russian Booker, National Bestseller, and Big Book.
Last year, the writer was awarded a prize by the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is undoubtedly the leader of the current thirty-year-old and 40-year-old prosaics.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day life story and storytelling has sparked heated debates among critics in a variety of ways.
It can be argued that the combined articles on prose and publicist Shadow, reviews of his books and journals create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
Discussions on “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to critic Sergey Chuprinin, are mostly about how its participants understand the word “lettering” as the present and future sees not only our word but also our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow it to include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually reduced in the sections “Absacs...”
