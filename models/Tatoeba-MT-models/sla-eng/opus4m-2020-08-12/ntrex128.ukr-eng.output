Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "associating with the maps"
Some CAs are shocked by the recommendation to change the name of their post to “member of the Wales Parliament” (MWP).
This recommendation came out of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
THE whole political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One CH from Labour claimed that his group was troubled by the rhymes of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, "twp" means "unconcerned" in Welsh, and "pwp" means "defection."
CHI from the Wales Party stated that his group as a whole is "unsatisfied" and offers alternatives.
One Welsh conservator said his group was “unbiased” about changing the name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a “mappet”.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation "u".
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the Assembly members will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self - Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the Assembly’s name in the Wales Parliament was widely supported.
With regard to what to call CHA, the commission proposes to call them “members of the Wales Parliament,” or WMP, but the MWP has received the most public support.
Of course, CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement may cause problems for Chairman Elin Jones, who should submit a bill of amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the removal of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote on their new name will be held when legislation is discussed.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Country Name
On Sunday, voters are voting on whether to change the country's name to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The vote was organized with the aim of settling a longstanding dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim on Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that changing the name is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint-Marten's calls are silent because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times.
“The old people I was talking to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner here,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing, there's nothing else."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today people are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer the local living room where they regularly enter.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as long as the leaders expect, and “it will sooner or later be where it began. ”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close, since it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their adherents.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint-Marten was built ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community that held the rituals nearby was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main street of commerce, and these merchants refused to hire blacks and raise them on duty.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set it up.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played the carillon in July called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also pointed out that this is the world's first carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, he was not replaced in St. Martin.
What's been going on in Saint-Martén for the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which were attended by church leaders and others by the bishop's diocese.
The Council -- the governing body of the parish, made up of the leaders of the Mirians -- wrote in July that the diocese was concerned that the diocese would "try to transfer expenses" to the council while the council did not take part in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark traumatized a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobbyists in California
According to officials, on Saturday a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him.
The attack took place almost seven o’clock in the morning at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and he and the group went to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill to catch a Lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
They tasted me!»
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his keyhole was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get them out of the water, ‘A shark in the water!’ added Hammel.
The boy was taken on a rifle to the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles at the media briefing told us that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities for 48 hours blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning on going to the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's going to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those in the universities.
As the British cosmetics market expands, it's worth 2.8 billion pounds of sterling (continues to grow at a time when the volume of clothing sales and home goods decreases) the increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 shops across the country, and the following year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to supermarkets looking for ways to use the space used previously for televisions, microwaves, and home goods.
Sainsbury's stated that they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: branded areas will appear, similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates Boutique’s cosmetics range: now most of the products presented will not be protested on animals, which young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a retailer of perfumery, is protesting his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like universities, because the network of supermarkets is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's computers by using more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opening Argos offices in hundreds of their stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it increased the sales of food products and also made both networks more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split the revenue from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the network owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury brands to skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could offer advice.
Our brand range is called to meet any needs, and a pleasant environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is competitive with the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is "crazy" because Holly Willoughby came out with a deal worth £11 million.
Peter Jones, star of the League of Dragons, is "stranged" because of the fact that the television broadcaster Holly Willoughby made a deal with his brand of life goods (the value of the contract is £11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was linked to Goop Guinette Peltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old lead program This Morning announced its entry into Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's Lear Dragon star to the point where at the last moment she came out of their profitable business of life goods to focus on new convenient contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was distraught when a gold girl from the TV confessed at a busy meeting Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new 1.5 million-pound deal meant that she no longer had enough time to dedicate to their common brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
This business was linked to Goop Guinette Peltrow's brand and had to double Willoughby's stock, estimated at 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source reported: “Truly was certainly Holly’s top priority.
He was to become its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit the business shocked all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlowe headquarters, it's full of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this Morning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost millions of companies because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and create further delays in running.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of the government in March.
The couple held holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s shares in television production.
Willoughby is going to be an M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as lead I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, close to Jones, said last night: “We will not comment on his affairs.”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for a comment that someone would consider "non-presidential" and for a very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump go to such great concessions?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the newsman. —
I didn't go to any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean leading diplomat Ri Young Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "appropriate response" from the United States to its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues its pressure - support sanctions.
While giving a talk at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results: the completion of rocket tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of US military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-filled stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lomboca earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboca population were affected, the national disaster was not declared a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" brings together a team to visit Palo until we know if foreign staff can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to determine whether international organizations should be allowed to provide assistance.
In view of the constant occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Tsunami shelters are built in the province of Aceh, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The apparently absence of a tsunami warning in Palo, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving among countless Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake sails to Pal but reaches the site of the new disaster will be able to do so in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his electoral campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to change next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by long-standing interfaith enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, reported the Indonesian agency on Sunday morning’s disaster management.
Many people remained trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed during the Friday earthquake by 7.5 points, which caused waves of 6 meters high, said the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was littered with ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation began this morning after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merciside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson-Muse, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for a response from people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "Investment is now in the early stages, but I ask all those who were near John Street in Birkenhed and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I'm also asking everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could download something on a video recorder, to contact us, because information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have stated that they are currently informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one is allowed in and out of the house.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his gift of speech.
The residents are now told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.

Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Crick's proposal "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “In view of the current debate on the taking of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statue at Westminster Palace would become a target.”
The iconocracy during the English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the preceding century.
The great statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Tornecroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure, which many think is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many probably more in the late 19th century than now, Cromwell believes that he is a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of historical debates that are ongoing.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and honored."
The killer pig destroyed the Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a ruptured artery near a pig market in Liupanshuy, Huizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
In Sinin, the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is about to be vaccinated in a pigsty.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigsty was open.
The brother noted that there was a large cabin in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a 249-pound cabin destroyed the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and defiled, ” stated a cousin of a victim named Wu, quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent its attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me, Juana and the market administration, are discussing compensation for his death.
Rarely, though, the cases of a pig attack on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and traumatized a man.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 kg, the Welsh farmer was held by a tractor until the farmer’s wife intimidated the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba stated to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may become a “trigger. ”
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
It was predicted that Hurricane Rosa was weakening by moving over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
But in the coming days, Rose will bring rain with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds at a speed of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1 hurricane) at 5 a.m. on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific is beginning to form a valley that is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will push a strong tropical humidity northward to the Southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rain to 25.4 inches [25.4 cm] in some parts of Mexico.
Next, in the near future, tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching deposits, will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 cm and 10.2 cm of rain is caused by dangerous floods, garbage streams, and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will lead to an increase in rainfall from 5 to 7 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a large area of Arizona.
Floods are possible in the rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We are urged not to go into the desert on foot because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring storms and storms.
In some parts of the northern coast of California, the nearness of the valley will result in strong rains.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause heavy streams of garbage and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first rainstorm in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and morning on Monday, and on Monday and Tuesday evenings the rain will be more extensive.
The heavy rain will go over the Fore Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperatures all over the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
At times, this results in short - distance temperatures.
On Sunday, a fine example of extreme temperatures in the central part of the United States will be observed.
It's almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the elderly will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a large area of the center and east of the United States, it will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.].
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability that the average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will rise in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh’s case
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report on the latest news Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake about the FBI's one-week investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh was getting her drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a senior school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It's very likely that more than 20.4 million people saw this on Friday, as reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not get numbers on other networks immediately, which also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in the offices.
By comparison, this audience is similar in size to the audience that is watching the playoffs series or the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose leading thought shows strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the hearing that lasted all day, with an average audience of 5.69 million, was noted in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the centerpiece of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS recorded protestors yelling at Flake while he was trying to take the elevator to the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, during which he was barked, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have power, and many women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had published the application, and before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadband channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh’s election to the Senate in full.
Flake said he would only do that if he knew the FBI was going to deal with the charges against the candidate next week, which required a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several other senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake was influential because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to nominate Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of playing politics around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview that took place in front of Theresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticised her so-called "Checkers' Plan for Brexit" by saying that to propose to Britain and the EU to draw each other's duties "absolutely absurd".

The Volcano Throws Ash on Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s volcanic ash has reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Centre on Saturday urged the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in the crater in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking numerous noises and impulses.
The photos on social networks show thin layers of ash on the forehead of cars in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as Hodgimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following a 7.1 - point earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favor of independence met with a special police unit, thousands of people joined the protestors to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on separation.
A proseparatist group in masks held by special targets threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The fighting took place later that day, and the police used rods to contain aggression.
A few hours later, groups of supporters of independence who chanted, “Let us not forget, let us not forgive!” met supporters of the country’s preservation who shouted, “Let us live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were helped to deal with the minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalonian separatists, tensions in an independent region remain high.
The voters generally voted in favour of independence, but the phenomenon was low, since most of those against the separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the National Police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they may vote, but now we are in a dead end, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties in favour of independence were unable to maintain momentum this year because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or jail for their participation in the referendum and their subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who made a protest to support the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who have been in the detention facility since the end of last year, announced that he would be going to the European Parliament next year.
“The status of candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderra several times.
The incident took place at Ballinagard-Krescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings noticed that the gate and the house themselves had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a car was fired from the crossbow.
Menga's hit secured Livingstone's victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingstone became a winner
A senior in the Livingston class has stunned Rangers and brought Steven Gerard a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox Club.
Dolly Mengi's hit was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Hibernian.
Gerard's team won no victory at the premiere of this season, and next Sunday, it plays with the Harts leaders, from which it is eight points behind.
On Thursday, Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna within the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues his undefeated move to six games in the division, and chief coach Holt hasn't been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone is missing out on the odds of unintelligible guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be long ahead of time before they killed, because their directness created Rangers with all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Lithgoe broke through the gate after he contradicted and took Craig Halkett's blow along the gate which made him headlong.
The masters were pleased that they had allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That's how the decisive goal was killed.
Rangers missed the free shot, and Livingstone made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Menga, who took the ball and shot it from the center of the penalty.
To this point, Rangers were dominated by a ball, but the protection of the field's masters proved impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike Kelly.
Scott Pittman was hit by the Rangers' golfer Allan MacGregor. Lithgow struck by the gate in another standard combination of Livingstone.
The Naves regularly flew into Livingstone's fine and were constantly neutralized, and two applications on the penalty board — after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and by hand — were rejected.
Livingstone phenomenon: analysis
Aladair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All of them played very well, and they continued to exceed expectations on this high-rise trajectory.
Their game style and composition have virtually not changed since returning to the highest level, but Holt should be given due credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played tremendously, organized a very good defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral on guard.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the guidance of Gerard, but now they don't really reach those standards.
They lacked the last ball -- only once they breached the defense of the field's masters -- and it was kind of like waking up to the Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was taken in Cologne in a mixed manner
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue skies were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some disputes over human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters did show up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Depford Road Accident: A Cycling Driver Dies in Collision with a Car
A bicycle driver died in a collision with a car in London.
An accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a lively road in the district of Deptford in the southeastern city about 10:15 a.m. in British standard time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after he fled from a place of adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police stated that they were working on setting up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Buses are banned, and bus routes are changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six prisoners were injured in riots
Six prison staff were injured by the disturbances in a male prison in a strict regime, the prison administration reported.
The riots in Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire began around 9:30 a.m. in British standard time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
A special unit called Tornado has been set up to stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing.
Officers were given medical attention in connection with minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison official commented: “For the resolution of the incident that is taking place in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, specially trained prison staff have been involved.
Six employees received medical attention in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and that their term behind bars may be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was sent to hospital after the prisoner's attack.
In October of last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious riots that attacked prisoners with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (drying areas may be beneficial)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of next week because the remains of Hurricane Rose are heading southwest through the desert, creating a risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods Monday and Tuesday in the territory from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, and on Monday night it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest projections of the National Hurricane Center, the Mogollon-Rome area in Arizona is projected to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm and the rainfall is projected to be 15.24 cm.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters of rainfall, perhaps up to 10.16 centimeters.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffer from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the force of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm, a hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico day or night.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant flood risk.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to North-West Sonorah is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue to pass through Arizona and reach South Utah late in the evening.
“The main danger that Rose or her remains are the very heavy rains in South California, Northwest Sonora, and Southwest America’s desert, ” reports the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and streams of garbage in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer-Norton attack: arrest of four people who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. in British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area, police reported Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking you to respond to anyone who might have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh "took anger and anger" from the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "took anger and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout the process of being promoted.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, fiercely and emotionally denying Christine Blazey Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing about the charges she had made.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Cavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is the vote for one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable experience in public service,” he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president kindly mentioned Cavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans’ appearance in the mid - term elections.
"In five weeks, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really running, ” he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission was to "oppose and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidature is expected to take place no later than Friday, said CNN assistant to one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, casualties rising
At least 384 people died, many washed up in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six feet (18 feet) in the dusk broke down to shore, beating many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami took place after the 7.5 - point earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they became victims,” said Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
“It was not just a tsunami, it was driving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 km/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
The aerial photos published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned around, and swords are surrounded by water.
Pushes continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of Friday's severe earthquake was 200 times more than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city at the end of the long, narrow cove could have contributed to the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage “wide-scale” and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared without news.
Nugroho noted that the victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palo in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we did not get any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and it is added that his staff and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had struck Pal, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time set out in the warning.
Amateur footage, shared on social media, shows a man on the top of the house issuing a frenzied warning of a tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water broke into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters failed to immediately verify the true frame.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious blackout, which cut the connection around Palo, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military personnel began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, reported the authorities, but evacuated people still badly needed food and other necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to help, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Fellow workers of World Vision from Donghali made it safely to Palu, where they hid in the tarpaulins installed in their office yard, but along the way they saw the devastation scenes, said Mr. Dosebo.
"They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams took decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign relief workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Palo.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster.
That's not what happened.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level, ” noted Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night had come down to Pala after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those not yet found still hoped that their loved ones' appearance would be a miracle that would adorn these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers obtained a woman who had been lying under a rock for two days, along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Paraplannerism Team, trained two missing para planners to participate in the Asian Games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other para planners who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As an older person in the field of paraplanerism, I have an emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which had spread among the paraplanetarian community, he was desperate to send messages about whatsApp to Pal’s rivals who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray branch, not a double blue branch.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away $26,750 while filling out an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “traveled behind to Brink’s coworker” and stole a bag of money to fill out.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, reports the news, but the police did not indicate the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Y
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change in Twitter, he wrote, “formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West was called Je for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his June album.
The change took place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces a singer named Ariane Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," the author of the show reported.
It's not just the shortening of the current professional name, West used to say that the word has religious meaning for it.
"I believe that "e" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Radio-Federal Big Boy.
So it's me, it's you, it's me, it's us.
Kanye, which means "one," has been reduced to just Je -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Grandfathery, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brazer Love.
A former colleague of West, J.E.I., also experimented with defission and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of a bloody debate over students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, López Obrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing some 300 people, and left - handed student movements began throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to learners and by opening more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal groups.
US funding in the field of artificial intelligence needs to be doubled
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, says an investor and practice in the area of XI Kai Fu Lee, which worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the A.I., although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. area.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become number one in innovation in the area of SI by 2030.
"Double budget for AI research would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the AI sphere," Lee said.
Double funding can double the probability that the next major AI achievement will be made in the US, said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Superstates of S.H.I.E.L.D.: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies of S.I. in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on the ASI system, which played the best American player at Otello, and later he was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee noted previous competitions from U.S. government technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency of Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes academic leaders, it is corporations," he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on ASI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States increase its efforts in the area of AI.
"I believe that Green Card should be automatically offered to the science candidates in the area of SFI," he said.
China’s National Council published its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding to academics, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Fund, he is now investing more than $100 million a year in research.
Meanwhile, the legislative authority of the United States, which wanted to create a Commission of National Safety of Artificial Intelligence, did not take any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to “Republic of Northern Macedonia” to allow for a long-standing dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether there would be a 50 per cent minimum vote that would allow the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership in the context of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for admission to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they support it to make it decisive.
It will take two thirds of Parliament's votes to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations were reported until 1:00.
However, it was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the urns.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter José Tanevsky in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country that will pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kwardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door,” said Kwardarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority is voting in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below what is needed.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first major blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since its beginning last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is going through all of Brighton's defenses and scores goals.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through Brighton's defenses and won Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The 65-minute goal of the game looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brayton defenders and found himself in an open field.
Then Agüero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then he went around a few more on the edge of Brighton's fine.
Then he made a pass to the left when he saw Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the ticket to give away the ball Aguero, who, with his right butt, launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating the Brighton goalie, Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said City Manager Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this point."
But the initial advantage of the blue and blue in this game was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful penetrating belt along the left flank of Leroy Sané.
Leroy made a few touches and then made the Sterling pass in the direction of the long-distance strap.
The sky-blue forward threw the ball at the gate just before it slipped off.
City will meet Hoffenheim at the 1255th Group Stage of the League of Champions at Rain Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany on Tuesday.
Shercer wants to take the points off the Rokis.
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of the playoffs, there were no substantial reasons to wait for another start.
But the competitive Schertzer hopes to go to the pitcher hill on Sunday in a game against Colorado Rokis, provided that Rokis still has a hard time getting to the playoffs. Now Rokis for one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rokis has at least the Wild Card to win the 5-2 over Nashionals on Friday night, but they're still trying to secure the title of the first division.
"Despite we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've seen in the whole year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals will announce who's going to be the starter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're leaning towards being Schertzer.
Shertzer, for whom this will be the 34th start, took a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington's right has the result of 18-7 of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars of 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump’s Meetings in West Virginia
The president kindly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so wherever I can, I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening now.
And they're firmly set up to restore power, using any means, you see meanness, filth.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to be overstepped to gain power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The Democratic mission, he said, is to "oppose and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean, disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling the senator-democrat Diane Feinstein by name that caused the audience to cry out loud.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give me the document?
Uh-huh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerable to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of condemning me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of those Labour Members of Parliament to be told that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti - Semitism.
I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, with regard to national security, with regard to Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on Friday's Nottingham East Labour Meeting says, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from Labour were just like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kinder, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it was ever implemented.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not have different views, and each opinion is judged from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues, as I thought before, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's only market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — it's followed by a series of attacks on social networks calling for withdrawal, condemning the centre's politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since my comments are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the tides of sexist or racist attacks every day but who never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of "trust" or change of the party's selection rules, the party narrows down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been urged not to go out there, not to speak so loud that I'm okay.
But that's not why I came into politics.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because of the lack of attention by the government of Tetcher my class in high school has literally collapsed, since then I want to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local councilman or the minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was puzzled by my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in the circumstances where the country is going to go to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both the Labour Party and neither: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there are no threats to call me off and no political advantage prevents me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air rises
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result, but, doubtless, Air deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of Scotland's Premierschip.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only unbeatable team of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the opportunities gives the hosts and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through the trials of our games so far, and we’re still invincible, so I have to be content, ” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I'm giving up Air, they used the odds better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, carried out by Frasier Klimo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, issued by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the Air leadership by using the toolbar and made and implemented a solo test just before the break, which accounted for 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose got a good start on the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Roarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on the stretcher, and from the Aer reboot, they pulled forward with the attempt of Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Klimo.
Captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the line of the ticket, McPherson made a touchdown behind the Air pier.
Climate carried out an attempt that he had done almost every time after the reboot, after which Kyle Rowe received from David Armstrong a blow to the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt by the host team.
Looks like the All-Playing star is set for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
It looks like the star of the "All More Game" Ford Kiran is set up for a new career in hospitality, and that's what you can conclude after he's known to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, a script he writes to that he's filming with an old comedy partner named Greg Hemfill.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the Glasgow's "rich restaurant business".
Sea of Ours: Interior Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings are hanging an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coastline that left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling on October 1st after five years of deliberation.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course it expects a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of ICJ decisions on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that after decades of deliberation, Chile will negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Here Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, little will change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to judge Chilean territory and noted that it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision was taken only six months after the final arguments had been made indicates that the matter was “not difficult, ” said Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law.
In Bolivia’s case, the last four years could have contributed to a setback.
“The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zarata.
Morales ’ wartime rhetoric blew up the remnants of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltz, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences by gaining mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we should leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which came into a deaf spot more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Ying.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will eventually bring North Korea to its knees is “an unreal dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Phinehas makes significant strides in disarmament.
And so does American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Phenyan takes seriously the abandonment of his arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
On Paris’s fashion shows were presented the latest trend of massive headwear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a number of eccentric master suits in the style of the spring-summer 2019 collection on the stage of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats captured Instagram this summer, and called designers have already sent their dizzying creations outside the podium.
Valentino made an extravagant beige hat with wide decorated feathers that covered the heads of models.
Among other things, the accessories are adorned with precious stones of coffee, a witch's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a range of original masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature resembled the equipment for underwater swimming with pipes and glasses, and the other looked like a cornea that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
Overriding hats came into fashion thanks to La Bombi, a straw hat with a six-inch-six-inch field that was seen on everyone from Rianna to Emily Ratazkowski.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave peace another creation: a straw beach bag the size of almost as a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The yellow-red Rafia bag with the white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera collection in the spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquemus on the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Faceae: “The following summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for overriding accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 excellent results were again obtained, complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which have over 30,000 students all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SPR) and want to provide the best service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they choose, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he understands it in his mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she takes it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just use English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are led by the best-rated subjects.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher A-ball.
Data collected at 74 SERNSH schools showed that 72% of students received A from Chinese and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also got A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as the subjects of NTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons employers cannot close vacancies due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising positions need language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
And no matter what career you choose, if someone learns a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong habit.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% were unable to speak well enough in foreign language to support the conversation and France was the only language in which a significant percentage of people (15%) spoke.
That's why investment in language teaching is now important for modern children.
Learning several languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide more opportunities for children to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will study its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment languages continue to have a vital value for the future country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered “a habit of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first launch for Los Angeles Lakers are almost there.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna play, it's not over yet.
"This is going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers pre-season schedule.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games,” he replied.
Trade rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today launches a series of pre-election rallies from Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five events scheduled for next week's Trump rally, including rallying in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote in favour of the nomination proposed by him to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump wants to form support for the future mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will the evening Trump rally take place in West Virginia, and how will we view it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online on live YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to the tense hearings that took place this week in connection with the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate’s vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this series of events is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives said that these five rallies next week were aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
“Controlling Congress is so critical to its agenda that the President will go to as many states as possible because the tense season of the pre-election campaign is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
A rally scheduled at Vesbanko Arena in Willing City today may be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris to have the president come to raise his ratings in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and full of hope for Sunday's singles
After three sessions, which ended in a unilateral victory, the afternoon Saturday forsomms could become exactly what the Ryder Cup lacked.
An emergency impulse pendulum is a completely fabricated sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse is working?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're four points ahead, so I think we see it as a little bit of an impulse," said Jordan Spitt as he was leaving.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, according to Spot, feel a little wind in their sails, and also many encourage, not least, the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each earned three points of four.
The bed with his killer punches from the bedpan to the green shows an example.
These larynx festivities became louder when, during the course of his round, he made a decisive patt and leveled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win the 15-hole match, was met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn't give up.
“You really should just try really hard and worry about your own game,” said Spit.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to become known.
The only players with more points than Spot and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder’s Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday afternoons, and they also managed to avoid the god on Saturday mornings and after lunch on Fridays and at the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players besides Fleetwood or Molinari to consolidate the Europeans' potential victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable on different holes at the same time.
However, the triumph of the Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got rid of Sergio García, the hero of the morning raffle when he was with Alex Noreen.
One god and two doves on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to observe the patterns and forsomms closely because of the interaction between the participants, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is now playing better as a team and has a lot of leverage on the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe is headed by 10-6 on the last day of Ryder's Cup
At the end of the day, Ryder's Cup of Europe will have a solid advantage, since after Saturday's raffles and forsoms it precedes the United States with an account of 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood's inspired duet and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the late Tiger Woods, and now they have four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who was trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning Formula Ones with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. was more resistance to force and won two matches, but they couldn't cut the gap.
Jim Furik's command requires eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (together "Mollywood"), after a sensational weekend, is only the second couple to score four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the playoffs, they teamed up to beat dead Woods and new American Bryson Deshambo with even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, demonstrated random flashes of genius, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in raffles and forsoms and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning raffles, returned to his partner, Henry Stanson, in the forsoms, to be defeated with a score of 2ta1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way in this pleasant, fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, the leading winner, set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Formulas and later defeated Paulter and Rory McLroy with a score of 4ta3 in the forsomas, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a deficit of four points in singles, although the Furika team needed nothing but a niche to save the trophy.
However, after a second place for two days, Sunday’s counterattack looks as if it was impossible for them.
North Korea says that “no way” will disarm in a unilateral order without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepens mistrust with the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “substantial measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
And while Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its progressive steps, his statement proved important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Phoenician had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Yin and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the real president of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for “the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea longs for the formal conclusion of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Phoenician must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on denuclearization first" and raises pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denies the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“Considering that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the United States leader pointed out to the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-yin over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were to be a party to this issue of denuclearization, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone into such a dead end.”
Despite this, Ri's tone differed sharply from last year's when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "man-rocketer" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at UN Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for the courage to use disarmament measures, but said that much more would have to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's denuclearisation.
On Wednesday Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward the Phoenicians for their actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The execution of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and unabatedly until we see full, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programs and ballistic missiles by Phenyanu.
Pompeo met Ri at the United Nations General Assembly’s culinary meeting and then said that the following month he would return to Phinehas to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but in a few hours, North Korea condemned him for "gangster requirements".
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States were to use “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim said he needed "appropriate measures" were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of his students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of rigorous learning all night after caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basis for taking care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham’s Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to him and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in the final course?"
“ She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, ” said a professor from The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are told the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university medical services, said that the university had decided to take a course after it had been discovered that students had been seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there are pictures of a room in the dormitory where students click coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
Another chapter explains how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chaseler.
The culture of pride for "sleeping all night" still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be the “secret weapon” of a student to cope with stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weights, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop a course after taking one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar training program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students be reminded that they should go to bed and also put up an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which are emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm that causes sleep problems.
"Liveington" 1-0 Rangers: Goal Mengi upset Gerard's boys
Rangers survived another exit saddening attack: Dolly Menga's strike brought Stephen Gerard, a distinguished team, defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Aybrox team wanted to win its first victory at the exit match after the February triumph over St. John's Day, with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard second as manager of 18 games. Gerard's team remained eight points behind the Scottish Premieres of Harts.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not seem to be able to balance the score.
Now Rangers are down to the sixth position, and Livingstone is up to the third, and they're only ahead of the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may find another inconvenience because Linsman Kalum Spence was forced to process a head injury after he was thrown into the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to a team that once passed Air in the Scottish League semifinals.
And Holt released the same Leo 11, which took one point to Harts last week, and was thrilled at the way his forced boys pushed his opponents at every turn.
Maybe Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingstone worked harder with the ball he got.
They were only supposed to kill in two minutes when the first manga pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half-defendant wasted this great opportunity by sending the ball by the gate.
Kagan Jacobs was hit by a deep free shot by a skipper named Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithough hit the back of the pole.
Rangers really got control, but there was more hope in the last third than there was faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a penalty on a quarter of an hour after his encounter with Stephen Loules, but Stephen Thomson refused to speak to the Colombian.
Rangers managed to make only two knocks on doors in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former doorman, Liam Kelly, was hit with the head of Lassana Kulibali and Ovié Ejaria, a calm blow.
Even though Livingstone’s 34-minute goal may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it only by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' cooking again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple finish.
During the break, Gerard replaced Coolibali with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately worked when the winger broke into Morelos, but the amazing Kelly pulled off his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the game they liked when Lithgo and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved in the last stages, but MacGregor was a good match for Jacobs before Lithgow hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a ticket when he met Jacobs, but Thompson took another look.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now here's a page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is coming... a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of culture, for example, in the 1950 film "Call the Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboy scientists.
Man: "What is this anyway?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how it affects the atoms of radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
And then these cells are able to see a protein that's common to many cancers, and then these cells re-enter the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has lost more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method involves removing immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-entering these cells in the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute for Cancer of the United States of America, Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
“HER2” stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer”, he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells in patients and teaching them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the SNL baseball show appeared in the studio, Kanye West, with a strong speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the audience’s negative reaction
In the SNL (Sunday Night) studio, Kanye whistled after his sumurant performance, during which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and announced that he was going to run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in baseball with the title "Let's Return America's Former Glory," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats, and again declared his support for Trump.
"White people often ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford’s sexual assault.
Although the West speech was not broadcast on live television, the video and its circulation were posted by the social media comedian Chris Rock.
It's still unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by placing this post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a bad situation behind him because of the main suit.
According to Washington Examiner, West stated, "When I was behind the scenes, I was treated harshly.
I was told, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball game."
They were making fun of me!
And then I'm told that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
The West continued, "Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent? I'll put on my Superman baseball because nobody can tell me what to do.
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety's weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative audience reaction in the hall, and SNL's actors seemed distracted, and one of the viewers said, "There was a dead silence in the studio."
News at the last minute was invited to replace a singer named Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West caused many surprises by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the Perrier bottle suit.
The news was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the bravest: Thank you for standing up to NATO."
Instead, Karen Hunter, the lead talk show, wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"But I will NOT reward him (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, confesses and throws out an ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he's "the one we used to know as Kanye Westa."
West is not the first performer to change his name, he's following the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Grandfathery, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
The rapper colleague Snoop Dog used to be called Snoop Lyon, and it's known that the musical legend of the last decade Prins changed his name to a symbol, and then he became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."

Keith Goerington, the star of The Game of Thrones, condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Goerington became famous for his role as a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series HBO's Game of Thrones.
However, a 31-year-old performanceist condemning the stereotype of a macho hero, arguing that because of such characters on screen, young boys often feel that they have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said that "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the popular era of hashtag #MeTo.
Keith, who recently married his colleague at the Game of Thrones, a 31-year-old actress named Rose Leslie, noted that he was "pretty determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm set up at the moment quite decisively, when did we get on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth because of the prism of the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for promoting brutality because of images of extremely courageous heroes.
He went, "What's natural and what's planted on us?
Why does it teach television and the street that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
I think today is a really important question, "How can we change that?"
It's obvious that the young boys are off track."
In his interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any of the pretzels and sieves of "The Thrones" after the next summer's show was over, because "he's already done with the battles and the horses."
Since November, Keith will be playing in the play of "The Real West" by Sam Shepard, the story of the movie producer and his brother the robber.
As an actor recently admitted, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he's ever gotten from being part of The Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during this show, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," Keith said.
In a fantasy show that won Emmy's awards, Rose played Igritt -- the love of the hero Goerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018, and the ceremony took place in the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a sharp 14% increase in new cases
China has seen a sharp increase of 14 percent in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are generally more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in past trends.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV was rapidly spread through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to health officials at a conference held in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected by HIV has fallen to almost zero.
In comparison with the previous year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000.
Timely transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community is often discriminated against.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are still married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
In most cases, the transmission of the disease is due to improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters denies sending the Republican senators' data into the network as a full-time employee and criticises the "hazardous lie" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, a member of the House of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, condemned the announcement that one of her employees had posted personal data from three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A L.A. Democrat claims that these statements spread "ultraright" to political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data came online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing with the Senate commission on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The data leak took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information had appeared that the IP address of the source was linked to Waters' office and was able to find the data of its current employee.
"These baseless statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality," Waters continued.
"The co-worker of my office, whose personal data and security are put at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely false, they don't match reality."
Waters was quickly criticized online, among others said former White House White House press secretary Ari Fleasher.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that with this nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When accused of what he did not do, there is no need to get angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and untouchable."
It seems that Fleischer made a parallel between Waters’ reaction and the criticism of the Democrats at Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is running for office in order to take Waters by midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is news if it's really true," he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had already reported "the relevant state authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
"We will do our best to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of Agent Johnny English's New Mission is a passing parody on spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson.
It's already a good tradition to look into every new British film of fiction inspired by Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comedy parodys about Johnny English.
Is it going to be a ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction about what we are, the nation's new export potential?
Anyway, Johnny English, with his moving face and his embroidered eyes, was once again able to make a mess, and his name is more than anything else, indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
Johnny is known to be an unscrupulously fun secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a lot of things, from that guy who played a tune from the film "Fire Wheels" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The figure is also depicted as a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the mess Atkinson once played in a long forgotten TV commercial by Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in the knight's armor approached the helicopter, and the shovels of the rifle were pounding on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for making a buffonade is well revealed, but humor is transitory, and at some points it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" motion pictures like Agent 007 and Mission Impossible, one of the ingredients of which is also a comedy.
It's almost as if the jokes are meant for children rather than adults, and the stupid attacks that happen to Johnny Ingles don't seem as inventive and thoughtful as the jokes of Atkinson in the silent movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
A British super-secret network of spies penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodeal role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the prime minister, a proud person who had already suffered devastating criticism and was deeply depressed by the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried best to convey the image that was inspired by Teresa May, but the scenario failed to fully expose it).
Intelligence advisors informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to hire someone who was retired.
The choice falls on the awkward Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some super-modern institution and informally teaches children operating undercover (there were some good jokes in this part of the English spy school of the year).
English is quickly taken to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he again meets his long - suffering friend Buff, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an experienced annoying person is not entirely in line with the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went out of business, Batman and Robin went back into line and suddenly met the fatal woman, Ophelia Pistoletov, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister is under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his wealth in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can remove the problem of the British network, the vicious Jason Voltt played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff are on their way back to their ridiculous pranks: they are dressed up as waiters in a fancy French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos by illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht called Volt; and English is making a real mess of trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to explore the planning of Volt’s house.
All the stops lead us to the final episode, but with their kindness and madness, it resembles a movie for children.
It's a passing movie.
And as I was looking at other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: can the British film industry not offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labourers deny the preparation of a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is due to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige managers of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will correspond to the party’s economic programme and channel the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Tread Unions, and it is expected that workers will be able to benefit from a change in the global economic situation.
The source at the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
Labourers didn't first endorse this idea because the Green Party promised to start a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party are now in favor of such a desire.
The Labour Party's speaker said, "There is no four-day work week in the political agenda of the party, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party's pre-election rally last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was set up to take back power from the impersonal directors of utilities and exploiters.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders of water companies can not get their share of the capital if the Labour government implements the "counting" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in corporate governance and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary private sector shares to employees with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking on 60 Minutes (60 Minutes), whether the investigation of the Cavanaugh case led by the FBI can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is running the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court is postponed at least for a week, and the question is whether or not the Republican senators will continue to support Cavanaugh after the Bureau's investigation has been published.
On Sunday's show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.
During the hearings, I told them that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and that accusation came out, and asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s opinion will not change anything.
"I think Cavanaugh's accusations are provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything," added Graham, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and an equally impressive mission to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be flocking to the Grand Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez's performances, but also to attract attention to the real purpose of the festival, the organizers want to fight the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay VIP tickets), visitors have to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as learning in a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help attract attention to the purpose of an organization -- eradicating poverty.
Are there any results, since the Global Citizen has 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is it really the idea to reward you for doing a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" when people feel they're actually changing something by signing an electronic petition or doing a Twitter publication?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “actions” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare the planned financial withdrawals and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as an example of its activities, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
An estimated 649 million people around the world have already been directly affected by the funds provided.
One of the main financial commitments is the Fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain, which investors and realisers committed themselves to helping children grow up and promised Rwanda $35 million in aid to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said a representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “actions” that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced that the funding for the project The Power of Nutrition aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children would be allocated.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme level of poverty?"
The representatives of Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and difficult path, so sometimes we'll fall and we'll fail.
However, like civil rights and apartheid actors, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Mona, is just part of the star performers who will perform at the New York festival this year, and they'll be rocked by Deborah Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Internal Affairs said that the United States could use naval forces to block the export of Russian energy resources
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, Washington may seek assistance from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia's participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy plants.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be an energy broker, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the US naval forces, it can provide free passage by sea and, where necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event, which was conducted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial organization that positions itself as the "vote of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared his approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sidedly developed" because its economy depends on the energy of mineral origin.
While these claims were being made, Trump’s administration aimed to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing Russian energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, officials of Trump administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the "unwelcome" project of the North Stream 2 project, which Trump said would make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas, which costs $11 billion, will double the capacity of existing gas pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons, an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused Germany’s negative reaction, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organisation of the Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our supply of energy resources," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "will seriously think" about running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would "seriously think" about running for president after the interim elections.
During a public meeting in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering making his candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that, there must be a woman at his head."
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider putting my candidacy for president."
During her meeting with the public Warren expressed her assessment of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he "leads his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the office of Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday's tweet Warren wrote, "...of course, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, most Voters in Warren don't think they should go to the polls in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Saffolka University Political Research Centre and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts opposed the senator's nomination.
Thirty - two percent supported the promotion.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, and that he could be put on the President's post by 38%, as opposed to 48%.
During the negotiations on the nominations of other famous Democrats who may be on the run in 2020, they are also referred to as former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden stated that he would take a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Trek Palin's PTSD during a rally to support Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through right now, which he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home," she told the rally to support Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trak's arrest "a problem that no one's paying attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are returning home not as they were before, more cruel, and want to know if they respect what their brothers made soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country."
According to a spokesman for the department of the Vassill City Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as with obstructing reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 states and D.C. support accusations of asylum policies
Eighteen states and D.C. support the accusations of a new U.S. policy that victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support a plaintiff who needed asylum and accused the policy in court.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sachs case for the U.S. Civil Rights Protection Union lawsuit, which charges federal politics and which was filed in August, is not being revealed.
The plaintiff said that her partner "and his cruel Bandits" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace's lawsuits said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often seek refuge in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy repeals the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision, whereby undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence could seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reisin, stated on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that the decision on applications for refugee status be based on the examination of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," the Court's analyst notes.
Then, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the United States are harmful to the country's economy, because they may potentially become entrepreneurs and fill the necessary labour resources.
Attorney General Jeff Sachs issued an order in June for immigration judges saying that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The asylum is granted to those persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," Seshns said during the presentation of the policy on June 11.
The granting of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek to find those who are still alive, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy down with a fever in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
"Each minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not enough."
Some return to their ruined homes, reaping the submerged benefits of trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake, which was made up of 7.5 points on the Richter scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including two Harris with a back and shoulder fracture, are resting near the Palo army hospital building, where patients are being helped under open skies by repeated pushes.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how a strong impulse shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been pushed in the middle of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "implementing psychological pressure" through "advertising propaganda."
A week after the state newspaper of China posted on the four pages of the American daily publication advertising on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay-per-view supplement in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after China was accused of trying to influence the election to Congress on November 6th. China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, officials in the United States said Trump, who accused Beijing of trying to intervene in the US elections, means a new phase of escalation by Washington, the goal of which is pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can place commercials to boost trade, there is an escalation in the trade war between Beijing and Washington in time, in which they have already increased their import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of repressive duties in China was intended to strike exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republic's Trump Party.
Terry Brandstead, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China’s largest agricultural exporter, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Branstead wrote in a column of the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "encourages the pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and press independence, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstead.
"In contrast, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of non-commissioners. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people are actually thinking about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which is disturbing, which leads to the conclusion that China's media is under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh, Republicans are setting up women voters against each other before the mid-term elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court judge Brett Cavanaugh after he has been charged with several sexual harassments, analysts warn that this may cause an unwanted reaction to the upcoming interim elections, especially in women.
Passiones are taking place around this situation, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to proceed to the vote.
Such things cannot then simply be played back," said Professor of Political Science of Maxwell Syracuse University during an interview with The Hill published on Saturday.
Rigger doubted that an investigation by the FBI, which at the last minute was under pressure by Senator Jeff Flake (a republican from Arizona), would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief advisor and spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn (Move on) Catherine Jean-Perry said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it either tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protestors sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when the Republicans decided to move on to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blaze Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stu Rotenberg's news website, a non-party political observer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it is true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women voters from 18 to 29 years of age from the suburbs that have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they do not like the President."
Even before Ford testified in connection with the charges against the Supreme Court judge for sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative voter response if Republicans insisted on confirming it.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, stated: "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news channel, Director Priorities of the United States (United States of America) (a group that helps in the election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil said, "it's not about the vote of the committee, the final vote, or the fact that Cavanaugh was on the bench, but how they reacted to the situation and how they acted."
Yet the American opinions about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, were divided.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony either believes or rather believes 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving or probably giving false testimony, while 30% of those surveyed said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of the Flake FBI, the charges brought by Ford and another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, are being investigated.
Last week, Ford testified under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her while in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is developing a platform with an open source Solid, whose idea belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt goal was "world domination."
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment."
It uses Solid technology to allow users to create a personal online data repository or a PO.
It may contain contact lists, current affairs lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it "enlargement of personal capabilities through data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
Now, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, several state-owned developers hired to work on the project, and a software volunteer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models are undergoing radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Medium Berners-Lee, Inrupt stated that the mission of Inrupt is to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Church of the Victoria Cross in the Years of World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross order to participate in hostilities during World War I is honored in his hometown in 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the award for participating in the Belengiz and Leokur attacks on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never found out that he had received Britain’s highest military prize.
On Saturday two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Catten Canal "through a very dense fog and under a dense fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the fiery edge and with "scrupulous courage" he led the machine gun forward, before which one broke into the field cannon and destroyed the three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he could never do again and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very proud of participating in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Peppe Pig."
Imagine that you are not sleeping all night just to watch the events of the Bellator 206, and you are denied the opportunity to review the main event.
There were 13 battles in the San José tournament posters, including six live broadcasters in Britain on the 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were getting together, the British TV set died wondering when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some spectators were not thrilled, since they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon was "some kind of a bad joke."
"In accordance with the government's decree, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to broadcast children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications with Bellator when asked about television,
Pig Peppa, yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach the audience in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about the repeat of the broadcast, we can arrange it," said Coker.
"But now it's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until Sunday and Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we had a lot of messages that we were responding to, and the text of those messages wasn't very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out to be an inadequacy for government regulations.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jump into the water, Tom Daley, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
In sharing in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he spoke openly about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that his fatherhood had made him less anxious about winning the Olympic Games.
The manager, Kirsty Young, who has been conducting this program for a long time, went to the hospital for several months.
When he came as a couple to Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt worse than anyone else when he was a kid, because "sociality didn't take you for granted when boys and girls liked him."
He said, "So far, the sense of inferiority and difference has been precisely what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove that something was "wary," not to disappoint all those who had finally learned about its orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympics prizer has become a well-known LBGT community rights fighter and has taken advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this hope to others.
The three - time world champion admitted that feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were a real surprise to him.
Daley married Oscar’s 20 - year - old laureate, but last year, he said, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at a young age" (at the first Olympics he was 14 years old and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive similar landings and falls.
In June, a son was born in a marriage called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "adception" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have thought only about what I should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the idea of the end and asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics before he died because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the front row because you won't be around anymore," said Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and gained bronze.
"I knew that's what I'd dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Gordy) in the performance of Heather Small – which reasoned with him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and still provokes ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. in English summertime.
On Saturday, Michaelson, who wasn't in shape, was taken out from the Ryder Cup tournament.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he has to reinvent the form so that this event doesn't get bad for him.
Michelson, who on a record 12th time takes part in a tournament that takes place once every two years, pulled Captain Jim Furik out of the game at the time of the forbols and forsames.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to master emotion.
Since Mikkelson was not famous for being a good shot even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete wasn't exactly suitable for a complex golf course for Le Golf National, where Raf usually punishes for straying blows.
And if the field isn't so much an obstacle as it is, in the ninth match on Sunday, we're going to have to meet with the Open Championship champion and the exact strike master of Francesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a couple with new Tommy Flintwood.
If Americans who fall behind three points after 12 single games start well, the match of Michaelson can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and he must have had nothing to add.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has no doubt of his own strength.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for the teams of the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I predicted more games, but that's what happened, and that's why we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes out on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record will be broken, which was the biggest match in Ryder's Cube.
At this he might end his career in the Ryder Cube tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
Michaelson's 18 won, 20 defeats, and 7 nocturnal results, but Furik said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's snug, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to make fun of others, he's a good guy to have on the team," Furik explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time coming upon him as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that the big breakup doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant breakout in front of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup tournament still does not guarantee a victory.
The Danish debuted in a game in the Valderrama Club in 1997, where a team led by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans for five points, but won the match with a small break with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderram field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we won violently," said Bjorn after watching the winning Class 2018 games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the breakup was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been solved.
We have to play with maximum return tomorrow.
Go out there and do whatever it takes.
The game will be over only when the result is on the board.
We have the goal of winning this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're well aware of who's against us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can go a different way.
We're going to have individual games tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to play the field with your partner when things are going well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
This is how you configure players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he also has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Furik expects his partners to play a better game on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furika himself, fate on the last day was returned by different parties: it was among the winners in Brooklyn, but it was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on someone’s side, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We put the players in the team in the right place, so it's like we're going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead a counterattack against Rory McElroy, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pooler.
"It's these partners that I've chosen in that order because I want to evenly distribute efforts throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players at the individual match.
The introduction of a new German battleship was postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German naval fleet was to be put into effect in 2014 instead of the obsolete battleships of the Cold War, but according to local media, this would not happen at least until next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the rapid increase in costs.
According to Die Zeit, received from a military spokesman, the launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the main vessel of the most recent frigates of Baden-Wurtemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 have to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiaircraft and antishipment missiles, and some techniques to reduce visibility, such as radiological, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of technical security, and new frigates are expected to be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warns that due to constant delays, modern warships, which would increase Germany’s military power at sea, will also be obsolete at the time of entry into service.
The long-suffering frigate F125 was placed in the headlines of the newspaper last year when the German naval forces officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the military ship has returned to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects" that made the battleship unfit for military operations.
The weaknesses of software are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg ship's crew consists of about 120 sailors – only half the number of military personnel who served in the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, making it less operational and limiting the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also included the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings of the collapse of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Bundestag, an authorized military officer, Hans-Peter Bartels, reported that the U.S. Navy had “a limited number of ships capable of carrying out combat tasks.”
The official claimed that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for a period of time, since the old ships had been put out of service and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret at the fact that none of the frigates of Baden-Württemberg class had been able to fill the Navy.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of Bats
A new study carried out in Scotland’s mountainous area aims to determine how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data they receive will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out conservation measures in the future.
In the gardens of Inverja in Wester Ross, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe species like bat dwarfs and bat pygmies, as well as the smell of a common and watery nightgown.
Special registrators will be placed in strategic locations in the area of land management to observe bat behavior during the season.
Scotland’s National Trust staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and frequency of bats ’ cries.
Then we're going to develop a detailed map of animal residence and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas of life are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help assess the effectiveness of environmental management (e.g. meadow formation) and determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined considerably in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of areas that rob them of their nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, fly paper, chemical treatment of building materials, and house cat attacks.
Actually, tellers are not blind.
However, hunting at night helps their ears to catch prey more effectively than their eyes.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which has over 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, bat problems are taken very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, check nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in Triv's area in Damfris-end-Galloway, where eight of the ten bats that live in Scotland have been found shelter.
David Thompson, the manager of the premises, claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"There are wonderful conditions for bats in the area of the site," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to know a lot about bats, because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before any technical work is done, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the young can cause up to 400 female babies to die, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
Kazan and their nests are protected by law, and animals are forbidden from killing, torturing, or harassing.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats.
Ronaldo rejects the rape charge, and his lawyers file a lawsuit against the German edition.
Christian Ronald called the charge of rape "stupid" and said that people are "trying to get attention," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspicious information.
The American woman Catherine Majorga accused the forvard of collective Portugal and the Juventus Football Club of the rape that took place in a 2009 emergency room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 in silence.
A few hours after the indictments were filed, 33-year-old Ronald turned to 142 million of his fans in Instagram, calling the relevant messages "a joke."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are slander," said the camera owner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to get attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added the football player, smiling.
According to Reuters News Agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are filing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges that they called "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the field of private life."
A lawyer named Christian Shertz said that a football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most violent cases of violation of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Ronaldo and Majorga nightclub, they returned to the number of the player who allegedly raped her anally. Such testimony was transferred to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Majorg claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell to his knees and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was raised by "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where the injuries were taken, but later she agreed to an excusable settlement because she "was afraid of revenge" and feared "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel a previous arrangement because she continues to suffer from an incident she said had taken place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to FK Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the Italian football grand, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever" the loss of auto-producers
Great Britain will regret it forever if it loses the status of world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, and that's warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by the statements made by Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would have to stop production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Minister Clark.
Japan’s automaker stated that the effects of border delays in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota’s cars are manufactured, the Auris and Avensis models, released about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain urgently leaves the EU by the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU will be affected without an international trade agreement.
For example, the BMW said that the Mini factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are that Brexit, without a deal, can cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line operates in the operational delivery mode of details and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for cars manufactured for purchases.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be disruptions in the supply of details that will result in delays and shortages of materials.
As stated in the company, the Toyota warehouse can contain no more than one day, so production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clarke pointed out that the EU's relationship plan, prepared by Teresa May (Chequers Plan), "is a separate framework for avoiding problems at the border."
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will not only allow us to succeed at the current moment, but also take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during today's radio show at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as other auto-producers, it is imperative that we preserve the established high-efficiency supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to report how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that an increase in costs will lead to a reduction in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsovaris, head of the United Nations trade union in the Bernaston factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can say from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
The government said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "scheduled for a week" while discussions are under way on Brett Cavanaugh's nomination as Supreme Court Judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the connections between Tramp and Russia and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
For several months in Washington, D.C., there is a discussion about the possibility of releasing a deputy attorney general who would endanger Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had made a statement on the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the President's mandate on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Legal Committee meeting where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, was on a TV show called Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date for the meeting, maybe it's going to be this week, and I expect it to be postponed for a week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I keep making sure the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct press briefings in the White House on September 10.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not linked to the public playing, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, adding without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the briefings would still take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate with the press a lot, and this should be particularly noticeable over the past few weeks, and the ability to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when going outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why it is, acting in front of journalists in a strange and strange way.
The Secretary of State for Health of Scotland addressed workers from the EU in response to concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the Scottish National Health Service to express their gratitude for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the costs of applications for permanent resettlement for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman said, "It was during the summer that the negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit were going on, and this autumn we have to wait for the right decisions.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible settlement.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That's why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries abroad share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie underwent immediate surgery after a head injury
Christian Ebercrombie, the team's "Tennessy State Tigers" team, underwent an immediate operation after receiving head trauma in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost at 31:27.
The head coach of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline where he was sick," said Reed.
On the sideline, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it on the stretcher for further examination.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers told Chris Harris from the WSMV Channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie was operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma yet." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-grader, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after joining the Illinois team.
He did five ball grabs on Sunday before leaving the game, so he's got 18 hits in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay more government taxes if property is acquired in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more in case of real estate acquisition in Britain, and according to the new plans, Tori will spend extra money on helping the homeless
This action neutralizes all attempts by Corbin to involve young voters
A higher state tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
At the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to involve an additional £120 million per year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more taxes, and additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing targeted at highly paid workers.
The increase in duties will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will use additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
An additional tax, accompanied by an increase in the two - year - old’s age to a second dwelling and a real estate for renting, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected that an additional £120 million per year will be involved.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many rich areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are deserted, as the large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower government tax to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by buying up land without further using it, and he urged Teresa May to give up quotas for affordable real estate in order to correct the "disgusting situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important real estate reforms, such as the control of rent and the failure of evictions without valid grounds.
He also proposes to expand the authority of local councils in the area of housing construction.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life to be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "More than anything else, I want to be the main coach of the Collecting Scotland."
Chief coach of the Sandersland FC, Jack Ross, says that "over all else" he ever wants to lead a collective Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scotsman set out to rebuild a club from the northeast of the country, which now holds third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stedium of Light this summer, returning last season to the St. Mirren FC in the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second total, but it's over," Ross told me during the Sportssound program on BBC Scotland radio.
"When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch the game of Scotland in the Hampton Park Stadium, and it always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at the Sandersland FC were Dick Lawyer, David Moys, Sam Ellardaise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poiet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of the Alloa Atletik FK claims he has not felt the excitement of moving to a large club following such authoritative names, precluding offers from FK "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the current stage, I think it's been a success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and its material and technical security, this club undoubtedly corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he noted.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but another result I'm not going to take for granted."
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years, and before that, he worked as a second coach at the Dhambarton FC, and spent 15 months at the FK Harts training headquarters.
And then he helped Allo's make out after the FK got to the third division, and in the next season, from Saint-Mirren, it went from the launch stage to the first division's winners' title.
According to Ross, he is now more comfortable than ever during his playing career in FC Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I found myself at a crossroads," he recalls, referring to the transition to the Alloa FK.
"I honestly believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, I made good money, and I reached certain heights.
It's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that have to be overcome each week.
I still experience stress and stress, but I feel at my place as head coach.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable in my entire adult life as I have since I chose this profession."

Research: 17:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for a cup of beer
Summer heat has helped increase the income of British pubs who are experiencing not the best of times, but has increased the pressure on restaurant networks.
In July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7%, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, who consults on business development, observed: "Through the solar weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, passed the same pattern as the previous month, when the yield of pubs grew by 2.8%.
The June fall was 1.8% in July.
The pubs and bars, which are focused on serving drinks, have the best indicators for the time being, their income growth is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The food - serving pubs also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
All visitors seem to be interested in is drinking.
In control pubs and pubs, the sales of drinks per month increased by 6.6%, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the RSM Department of Free and Busy Business, said, "We've been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sporting events remain key factors affecting domestic sales.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits, and the annual decline in sales by 4.8% is a particular concern in terms of the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer was not the best time for food-giving establishments, and we'll see if the temperature we saw in August could give them such a necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
The industry indicator of the sales volume of Coffer Peach Tracker in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analyzed productivity rates of 47 working groups with a total circulation of over £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a hidden account on the social network.
According to the study, 1 in 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, has a social networking account hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of the students reported having a "core account" showing their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under the age of 11, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for photo sharing.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a clean "core" account that shows their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who happened to come across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw the call "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmittresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles on social networks. Half of these children found that the extra account is secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "We are very concerned that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyde Doyle will be a "athlete representative" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elid Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics as independent director at the annual general council of members of the government.
Doyle is Scotland's most iconic athlete, and the chairman of the board of Yen Beatty has called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sport movement to take advantage of its wide international experience over the past decade.
"Ailid enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by bringing her to the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty assured.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - time Olympic champion who won 200 - 400 - foot - long [200 - 400 m] races in Atlanta in 1996, and now a BBC sports watcher, lost the opportunity to walk through a transitory ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I have been able to recover fully, and I have learned to walk again, and today I am doing a dynamic exercise!
Thank you for the words of support!"
Women's milk-smoker commercial compared to cows -- Internet users' opinions split up.
The milk-smoker manufacturer faced a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent human milk-smoker," the technology-producing company Elvie released a humorous music video-style commercial to demonstrate the freedom that mothers enjoy from a new vacuum cleaner.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-shining song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and, "As you can see, it's not a wash, it's my breasts."
And then the chorus goes, "Smoking, sucking, sucking, sucking, sucking, sucking, sucking."
However, an advertisement published on Facebook caused a heated discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of Internet users was mixed, and many noted that advertising was underestimated by the "terrible organisation" of milk production in industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and given birth to give milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie can easily be hidden in an Elvie/Mother
Here's another comment: "Of course it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not include them for advertising a milk-smoker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "This ad is a long way from reality."
The other users were defending the commercial, and one of the women in the video seemed really funny.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would surely have bought such a thing if I were still breast - feeding.
When I sucked milk, I felt really like a cow.
The commercial was a bit crazy, but I didn't find any hidden meaning in it.
A wonderful product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Mother-oriented commercials that suck up milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk-smokers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner works quite quietly, has no wires or pipes, and easily hides in a booster for feeding, thus allowing women to move freely, to hold their children and even to go outside.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother's advertising agency, commented on this situation: "Elvie's vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative representation.
And by doing a parallel between women who are sucking milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way, by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new vacuum cleaner will bring.
Elvie's vacuum cleaner doesn't get into the headlines for the first time.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the stage with this product while displaying the clothes from the modeler Martha Yakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies of Trump's administration have complicated the process of placing children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, immigrants themselves were undocumented, and now they are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high official of the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified before Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of minors without a escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally, and many of them are foreigners who have committed offences.
That is why we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the staff at the shelter, to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, not 60 days later, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum by decision of the court will be deported quickly.
According to staff members, shelter and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will feel anxiety or depression, the more likely they may be to have violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers claim that these problems are exacerbated in larger - size establishments, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving our children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say good - bye to our friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many have experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France and Turkey immediately to withdraw troops
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although war had been ongoing in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the control of terrorism, so "putting them in the right place."
"They should go immediately and not make conditions," he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - ravaged country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured them that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of spreading unfounded fears, which prevented refugees from returning.
"We called for international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We see an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the reconstruction of the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great plot of rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Treaty has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the treaty had "clear terms," and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related fighters, the front of the al-Nusra, who would be "destroyed".
Emissary Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meetings of the new committee to be composed of representatives of the government and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and to create conditions for elections.
Mualem put the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "review of articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Converted
According to this logic, Trump can be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not authorize early after the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt that would be the most dramatic end of the presidency all the time!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel has reached the peak of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Ber, the producer of the "Last Candidate" drama on the ABC channel about the Secretary of State who becomes president after the devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skwell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Only Funny Moments: as well as a few hard truths about breaking into a Hollywood men's club" suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Roy's case against Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Disposal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed about the citizens when you've been watching for six hours as a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "well-known" sources for your book "Fear," Paul Manafort's skin jacket from an ostrich for $15,000 -- that's what The Washington Post wrote about it, and the results of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of reality-show is partly related to the fact that you have something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the Lombardo Star, about the rotations in the acting warehouse and the daily plot twists in the "Trump" show.
If you allow yourself to miss one episode, you can lose hopelessness.
When I met Mr. Fleise at his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai this week, there was warm sunlight (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV -- not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
"I remember us creating all those crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seemed to be right."

External Inflation in the Worst Intermediate Elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, extra money is being spent, because by looking at the boundaries of the constituencies, two valid congressmen are competing for one chair.
A Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lamb, who won a victory in another district in the last spring’s additional election, is fighting for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed.
The Lamb opposes another congressman, the republican Keith Roths, who now represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely identical to the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were designated for the benefit of the Republicans in contravention of the constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district provoked fierce opposition between the financial units of the main parties, the US Democratic Party Committee of Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after a victory with minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections to Congress in March, which were widely used by the public.
This place has been owned by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point victory in this area.
Political experts have given little advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China’s support was considered, but they reconsidered.
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panami, and before that, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners got the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the Department of State have decided to withdraw US diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to deny Taiwan," said Department Press Secretary Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for the reduction of financial assistance and the target restrictions on the granting of visas, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As a result of the internal councils, officials from the North and Central American countries held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, and a similar move took place last year, and it was seen as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level officials had come to understand what they wanted the conference to be, and in fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October to indicate that the administration considers this to be very important.
At the same time, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new harsh reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three US officials, two of whom were diplomats, on terms of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under conditions of anonymity.
Study History
Another inconvenience may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a valid confirmation of why it can be found in the public information currently available.
It is reported that in his investigation, Mueller is investigating the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress is changed, Trumpu will have to report to the congressmen as well as to the voters and eventually to the parties.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
History is determined by such turning points, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller's fate rests?
Rosenstein got into trouble even as this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record talks with the president and shared his thoughts on the inadequacy of Trump's position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation into Brett Cavanaugh's case, which recently began with the FBI, is not sufficiently thorough or honest or if Cavanaugh's candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is approved despite compelling allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote in favour of those members of Congress who will be able to bring Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these trials, bad times will come for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism into the future?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Research Fellow at the Brooklyn Institute, Head of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, U.S.A., author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrans of Rangers with optimism awaits a meeting with Vienna's Rapid.
The Rangers FC accepts the Rapid on Thursday, and after the amazing nobody in Spain in the game with the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, winning over the Austrians will provide the Scottish Club with a good chance of getting out of the G League of Europe.
Because of knee trauma, half-protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a game with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a strong team," noted a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and winning one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could move forward, but in general nothing can probably be considered a just result.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
There will be another major opposition in the League of Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, because our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fighters, and I'm sure we can give the fight a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending the changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of pension savings
Although poll participants had a clear idea of how they'd like to take care of themselves, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research of Nationwide said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide branch of life insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you don't give your wishes to your parents in advance.
Ask your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial consultant: he can advise on how to cover the costs involved.
Long - term care sources include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self - insurance at your own expense (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents, which will allow you to avoid the legal burden in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative, who will control your medical care and see to it that your wishes are fulfilled if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we recommend that we build confidence in the management of money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you fail.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to a hospital.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, government officials report, but the number of victims may increase.
Because of the exit of the communications system, officials working on humanitarian aid can't get any information from the Dongal Regent, a region north of Palo, located closer to the 7.5-point epicenter of the earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Consider some basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800, according to 2017 figures.
When an earthquake struck the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
According to 2017, about 299,200 people live in a regent, an administrative area located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed as a result of the tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fiery ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: In late March early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 - ball earthquake hit the south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, the 7.6 - point earthquake was recorded.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - ball earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentaway near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters [10 m] high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Podajya regency in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 people were killed under the rubble of buildings.
2018: severe earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report published on Saturday by the state police of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin of Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the reporting of a case of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTOU, Palin is in custody in the Matanuska-Sustitna detention facility with a 500 dollar bond.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Pailin is accused of three Class A offenses, which includes an arrest for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also being charged with class B misdemeanors, which is punishable by imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans ’ Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and carrying an alcohol-drunk weapon when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent conduct with post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami: Hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - ball magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The communications and electricity networks have gone out of business, and the number of victims can increase in the coming days.
An earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital city of Jakarta Indonesia.
The social networking video shows the moment the event struck.
Hundreds gathered for a festival at Palu Beach when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a terrorist in New York
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Sifulo Saipova, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, which resulted in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October of 30 years, Saipov is said to be driving a rental car at the Home Depot Truck, and he took a bicycle ride along the road in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started hitting bikers and pedestrians that were on his way.
According to a report on the intention to be executed in the Southern District of New York to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Sayipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to court records, each of these points of charge provides for the possibility of death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Jury charged Sayip with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually file in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors who described Saipe's crime as "terrible, cruel and malicious," this attack is the result of "serious planning and premeditated intent."
The victims of Cyfulla Habibullaevich Saip’s injuries, injuries or injuries were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagukko, as described in the intention report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since a criminal case punishable by the death penalty was last committed in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was imposed in New York in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saip’s court records, a native of Uzbekistan, he failed to demonstrate remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Sayipov informed the authorities that he had been inspired by the video attacks that he had been watching on his phone.
Police report that he also asked for an IDIEL flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that they were "very disappointed" by such a decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept confession of guilt and sentence life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only reinforce the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims," Patton said.
Sayipov’s defense party had also previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentary MP from the Conservative Party believes that NIJELLA FARAJA needs to be appointed responsible for the talks on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the conservative party's assembly, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, because one of the MEPs of the Parliament, Teresa May, proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out," if Mr. Faraj was Secretary of Brexit.
The attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was further drawn to the fact that members of the Conservative Party, who were opposed to the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is working hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by the supporters of Brexit, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon its attempt to negotiate with Brussels, despite its negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between what it proposes and chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal, Mr. Bone said he wanted to give up Chequers.
He invited Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out already," he said.
Parliamentary MP Wellingboro added, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars not to obey.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and they don't want to go out is totally wrong."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking the streets and fighting for voters' votes.
Please reject Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "The prime ministers retain their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said that politicians should "feel pressure" if they were going to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they're not going to get away with it."
In a message to a crowd full of enthusiasm, he added, "I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing this country's national army, which will lead us to a victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governanced, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the city center.
A couple of activists were waving banners against Brexit when the group started this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because security problems arose after the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organised border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning on "serious thinking" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would "seriously think about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a representative of the West Massachusetts Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, is running for second term in November against a member of the Republican party Jeff Dil, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is being viewed as a major candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting took place with voters in the form of general assemblies since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "it's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that, there must be a woman at his head."
Arrested a suspect in the shooting of a baseball player named LSU Tigers Sims.
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported on Saturday that Wade Sims was arrested on Friday as a suspect in the murder of a basketball player named LSU Tigers.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the shooting asking me to help you identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at Southtern University on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to have been at the scene of the crime, armed, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, who grew up six feet and six inches and played junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Grand Prime Minister of Russia: Lewis Hamilton shortens his backing in the world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’s team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a pretty good start with the poul-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po, and almost passed Hamilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pit-stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot drove another round and went behind the Fettel, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after some wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, resulting in Ferrari driving reluctantly leaving the interior space because of the risk that it would tighten, after he managed to break forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish line and move Kimi Rikkonen out of fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th wheel, but he couldn't pick up the pace at the last eight, so Rikkonen took fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Walter was teaching at the top of the weekend and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive through.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place," Hemilton said.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressive
At a rally Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Fainstein for her firm stand that she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blazey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual violence at Brett Cavanaugh's Supreme Court.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead voiced his opinion about the events in the Senate that he said demonstrated human "subversiveness, disgustingness and lying."
"The only thing that could happen, and everything that's been going on for the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see evil people who demonstrate wickedness, disgust and lying," he said.
"You look at publications and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents? – "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't advertise," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September, his content was announced, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I did not disclose the information received from her," said the Feinstein Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her denial didn't seem to appeal to the president who commented during Saturday's rally, "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't very impressive.
Maybe she hasn't done it, but I've never seen anyone stay worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that the Democrats were using accusations for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power in all necessary ways.
You see ugliness, disgust, they don't care who you insult, who you have to cross to gain power and control from," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League, Dundee Stars, Belfast Giants, 5:3 p.m.
Giants player Patrick Duyer left two matches in a match against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" was rehabilitated for Friday's victory in an elite league by Belfast Giants, winning a five-to-three match on Saturday.
The Giants were given an early advantage in two teaspoons thanks to the pitches of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney leveled the score in the home game, and then Duyer brought the Giants forward again.
Dandy player François Bushar leveled the score, and two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen goals ensured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season to defeat Adam Keefe's team that won a willful victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season, three previous matches won by the Giants team.
The first chaibe Duyer left for the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFoll was transferred, and four minutes later, Boeville, who received a shaiba from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After a stressful first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Sullivan returned the landowners to the game, and by the 16th minute (15:16) Couni, after receiving the puck from Matt Markward, leveled the score.
Duyer preferred the Giants before the first break, leaving his second chaiba at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bushar, at 27:37, again leveled the score by dropping the puck when his team was outnumbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first moved "Dandy" forward and ensured his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, is playing the exit match against Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he was able to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after the severe earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Powerful underground movements continue to shake the area, and many have been overwhelmed in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a very well-balanced control tower at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the airstrip at the time, was safely up.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going down.
Later, he died in a hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Sirite said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikipapan to Kalimantan, which is to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands because the agency for mitigating the effects of the country's natural disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can grow because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves that reached six feet [6 m] had devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency aid brings bodies every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are all over the place.
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Odo, arrived in Pal on Sunday and addressed the country's military officials: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, after a plane crashed into a lagoon, a man disappeared
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was impossible to find one passenger on Saturday’s day.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Jane.
Jane told me that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane by being in a water belt.
He said that the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
In the U.S. U.S., sailors who worked nearby to modernize the dock also helped with rescue operations, transporting people to shore by inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in airline accidents in the last two decades, but Air Niugini is not included in this list.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replicate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulett, reports The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of several cell phones that showed that Tellys was from Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellys claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Gail.
The defense is due to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has abandoned political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the wells and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the resurgence of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark skin?!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for dismissal, receiving a racist message.
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misdirected message from their mother complaining that she was "another dark woman."
The wife denies that they're racist, comparing a lawsuit with a demand.
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who had arrived on her first working day in 2016, was dark skin.
"Neither is it a dark one," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
According to New York Post, after realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and released Miss Morris, and she said that their previous nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job badly and that instead she was expecting a nurse from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is filing for a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for the salary she'd be paid in six months for living in a marriage that she was originally hired for, even without a contract, and they were going to pay her $350 a day.
"I want to show them that they don't have to do that," she said on Friday, and she added, "I know this is discrimination."
In response to charges of being racist, the couple claimed that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man you treated rudely, even if it wasn't on purpose?
Your baby?
INJURY."
Comparing the lawsuit to "requirement," Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and she hadn't called in yet.
"Would you take revenge on someone after this?
This is a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book had been printed, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first person to read the book before it was published.
Now that's funny, because we know about the huge success that the story of Paddington has achieved."
Speaking of her father who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, he was optimistic about what his job was rejected, and she shared, on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, how she felt "joy and sadness" at the same time, because her father died a year ago.
Regarding Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a pretty humble man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
'But Paddington was as real to him as his own child!' because when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although they are not their own, not our own victories.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success just like that.
Although Paddington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye on the phone
After landing her daughter, she was sent to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Over phoned regularly, said everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Eden Laperuz.
"And then Over called me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Daddy, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating, gradually ceased to work, and they came out of her system.
She died a while before everything was turned off.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't grieve, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have really held myself in my arms."
Finally, Mrs. Eden Laperuz, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, got on a plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to face.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave on the Walli Bridge postcards with telephone numbers that people can ask for support and messages that they would like to inspire.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "not in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis made the cards, "so people know there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Miss Humphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, to whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely discouraged, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must survive it: "It has caused a destructive
It's a family thing.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in time and the nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "breaking up" against the background of an inexhaustible loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their unwillingness has to do with time.
The mid-term elections will only take five weeks, November 6, if Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct their own elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators asking them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush's rule, and he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now in session, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting that would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean defectors has "decreased"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined, the South Korean legislator stated.
Park Pion Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of Integration of the Republic of South Korea, said that the number of refugees was 1,127 in the past year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who smuggle illegals now demand more money for it.
In Phenyan, they refrained from public commenting.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan and discussed the issue of denuclearization, which had come to a standstill.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Cheng-Yin in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon-Ho accused the United States of not making progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so there can be no question of unilateral disarmament under these circumstances," said Ri Yeon-Ho in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Cavanaugh "sister" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
A minority leader in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Cavanaugh "sister" and said that he was out of temperament for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I kept thinking that if a woman ever spoke like this, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "absorbed and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements and his statement against Clinton and the Democrats he will take away his own candidacy," she said.
The Pelosi was outraged when she was asked if she would try to announce Kavanaugh's impeachment if his guilt was confirmed and if the majority of the Democrats in the House of Representatives were to receive it.
"I'll put it this way: if he doesn't speak the truth of Congress or the FBI, it's not only for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the law on available medical care or the Roy v. Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of Cavanaugh’s approval, he asked whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge becomes a hysterical, prejudiced person and we say how wonderful," said Pelosi.
Women must have these weapons.
These are the righteous words that have been in store for months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She said, "A woman who worked as executive director and helped me a lot said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the talker, "You might think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are seen as an acceptable way out of anger partly because they're perceived differently.
One of my most clear memories of my first job in the office, where most men worked, was when I once cried with unspeakable anger, and the older woman was an unfriendly manager, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught out of wedlock on a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me laughing after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the congregation, so she made a promise not to take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of the men of $1,000, only gave her $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she said.
When she gave the talk and announced that she was not going to make an official campaign, she was covered with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it very difficult to raise money and make her focus on voters rather than on members of the Chamber of Deputies, and anger at sexism.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Miss Schroeder.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far before it was completed, in the long run, the divide between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shots early this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week's biggest situation is because of new prices for goods totalling $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually taxes half of all the goods that come from China.
Beijing has been paying off the same coin every time, with a recent bribe of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to doing the same thing, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be able to keep that promise soon.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for the president of China, Xinjin, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can give China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any country, and this actually poses a greater threat than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security Analysis Centre.
Foreign Minister says Syria is "ready" to return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek assistance in rebuilding a war - ravaged country that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate terror - torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the country's war-torn state.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional help or help from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe fortifies the victory for Ryder's Cube in Paris
The team of Europe won the Battle of Ryder in 2018, when the US team won a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won the 1993 Club Ryder tournament.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who tried his best for most of the tournament, broke his first far-reaching blow on the 16th hole of a pair-3 into the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever passed with a score of 5-0-0 since the beginning of the modern-day tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spit has been defeated with a score of 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbierna Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rating, gave in to 2-1 of Jan Poulter of England, who may have been in the Ryder Club for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who has won the tournament most of the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but there's nothing I can do today.
It's been a rough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad to return the cup.
It's the team's merit, and I'm happy to be able to help," he said, without holding back his emotions, Garcia after winning Europe.
He's handing over to his fellow countryman John Remus, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record at 13-21-3 Ryder Club.
It's a strange statistic for one of the most outstanding players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments, giving up only Jack Niklaus.
During the weekends, the U.S. Assembly tried to reach the Fairway Zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who were showing a high - class golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furik of the United States said about his team after the inconsolable performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
Taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Committee of the Ryder Club, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can’t help but commend them.
We've lost."
