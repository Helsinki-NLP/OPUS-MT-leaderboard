The Social Map of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport benefits.
As of 24 September, the arrangements for the facilitation of the travel of citizens using the social map of the Ivanov region are changing.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Federation for the Ivanov Region, the changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport licence and bring the social map interconnection into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the FZ “National Payment System”.
At the same time, the Social Map of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the filling limit is now set, not in travel as before, but in cash, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles in winter, during summer periods not more than 800 rubles per month.
The social card holders will now need to monitor, not the number of trips remaining, but the balance of the funds, on the receipts issued in transport.
The cost of a concessional journey for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the travel costs are reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the completion of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
A new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending on the social map, with accuracy to the cops.
In addition, it is possible to return credited but unspent funds.
Let us also add that the calculation scheme with carriers is becoming transparent, since now half the cost of travel is paid by a citizen and the same amount is reimbursed by the carrier.
No commission will be charged when the money is put on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of Ivanov Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social-map visits were made in the region, and in 2015 almost 25 million visits were made.
More than 470 million roubles are included in the regional budget for the granting of a social-map citizen ' s concessional travel.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher admits to killing a friend
During the 911 call, school teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that it was necessary for staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "sand" living in the house, but he was probably upset, and he said that the contact of the deceased's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note that was carelessly written on a white sheet of lazy paper: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could bring it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to representatives of the organs signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta, Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where the police believe he shot all the respected professors of Ethan Schmidt's history on the doorstep of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta State University, Lynne Baford, reported that the university staff had learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims would have one more thing: Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, officials of the authorities were still trying to paint a picture of the motives behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Gotya, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his book, in which he expressed his appreciation to the “beautiful people ” with whom he crossed his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Bivers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him about how he was coping with stress at the end of the school year 2014-15.
Earlier Lamb asked the University of Delta to grant him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee his automatic appointment as a teacher.
University President William Laforge reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamb's trail after he fled campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a semi-charged .38 caliber gun in the back yard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, reported the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His engine car was still on the driveway.
Suddenly, it was not clear why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000, in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical science in the spring of that year.
A longtime friend of Lamba described him as a wise, charismatic, and cheerful person.
Carla Hearston told me that she was 15, and Lambo was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who spent years trying to teach her guitar.
In those years, he had enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls were wandering around when he was around," says Hayston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been dating for some time.
At the time of the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gotya in a brick house, the opposite side of which goes out on the canal.
According to the police, there's nothing wrong with the dog.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," said O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't seeing Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both spoke at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts together from time to time.
O'Stin told me his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at the well-lit bar The Julep Room in Gotje, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5th, when Lamb finished playing guitar and mouthpiece for few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We've had fun and we've made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial ceremony at the University of Delta campus in Cleveland.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The sessions will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
Crisis over.
Today's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the Associated Press Emily Wagner Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police ' s statement that Lamb ' s call had been made after the murder of Schmidt and that, although Lamb had spoken of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they had been married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the child's playthings and goods player assures the staff and temporary staff that he will be able to work for more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, less than the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although several months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer and companies are getting ready to hire temporary staff to have enough stock in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the movie "Back to the Future" was a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was in the autumn, where Princess Diana would sit next to me," he said in a trailer to the documentary "Back in Time" on the screen.
The movie's starting, and I'm starting to think that I'm literally at the distance of an outstretched hand and in one fake yawn from seeing Princess Welski.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about the movie "Back to the Future" which includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The premiere of the movie "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"To me," says Spielberg, "this is undoubtedly the greatest movie of the time travels ever recorded."
Back in time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN chapter states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is no “war solution” for almost five years, and the increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions.
The UN chapter once again called upon all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon announced at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, had made the situation “unsolved”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results show that Donald Trump doesn't joke
Some tried to pin a provocative label on him.
Others turned away from him, taking him for a joke.
And some people need a scandal.
But as some Republicans have tried to waver Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump's advantage in two-digit figures, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for a real estate magnet in terms of the chances of obtaining a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his former popularity to German Kane, none of whom won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super Committee for Political Action and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize Trump's undiminished strength and begin to receive their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the polls that say that the magnet of real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings for Trump's sympathy went up to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University revealed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude to this magnet in the real estate field.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
In early August, this was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now favour Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
All of these indicators are achieved at the beginning.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans there were in favor of Trump.
Two thirds of those voting for the GOP would have made Trump a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either been “excited” or “satisfaction” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they'd treat them "with admiration" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be “unsatisfied” or “disappointed” if Jeb Bush's favorite is a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is a problem.
While Trump is being criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of voters throughout the country think that the magnet has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington post survey showed on Monday.
The same figure appears in the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think that he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective in the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temper is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When they wear their hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GoP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not the case when four out of ten were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GoP voters had previously had no correct magic crystal.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to come together around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some indications suggest that such a gap is likely to be advantageous to Trump, while non-supporting Trump is evenly distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Randa Paula, John Kesic and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's missing him?
Ben Carson beat a businessman to 19 points in a "one-on-one" hypothetical contest.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey Tuesday shows that only over half of Trump voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with his colleague, out-sider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" two months ago in his campaign address, the topic of immigration has become most relevant in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that Trump's posence will deter key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent renegade.
But according to the ABC/Post survey Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now rely on the support of approximately half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans say on Monday that they want a political outsider rather than a man with experience in government work.
And they're also offended at Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent being “satisfactioned” and 21 per cent being “angry”.
The Government will decide on the fate of pension indices in October.
RF Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec said that the Government was now looking for options for implementing the pension indexation law in 2016 to a real level of inflation, transmitted by WG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the submission of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the Cabin discusses the possibility of prolonging the decision to freeze the Russian savings pension.
Hunger noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion rubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the following year is roughly the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is yet to be a final decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Gladec believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that he is paid by society.
Previously, the media reported that two options for balancing the State budget were being considered in the Cabinet.
Why are the ages often irritable and reddish?
Ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashov answers:
Our centuries are broads that protect the eyeball from the multitude of tiny particles that sit on them.
As we forget the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffing ourselves.
The output is simple:
Don't rub your eyes with your dirty hands, wear a special wet napkin for a century.
not less than 1-2 times a day, clear the end of the century of the harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleansing procedures should also be complemented by warm compressions with openings of herbs (scarf, romach), which fuel the thick secret of the salt glands, and then by the massage of the ends of the century, which should be carried out by circular motions of the fingertips;
Do not use alcohol - containing drugs when washing makeup.
They dry and decontaminate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secret of salt glands.
Phinehas claims that Korean nuclear power has created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities have reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country is the Jonben nuclear complex that works “fully”.
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and in quality”.
The last test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
No plans have been made for the reactor to resume its full operation since then.
Phenyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also conducted mid- and low-range rocket tests on a number of occasions, says Polit.ru.
Gyrinski demanded that the Russian anthem should be removed from the memory of the brotherly peoples.
The leader of the LDPR, Vladimir Girinovski, believes that the reference to the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He stated this during the meeting of the State, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long hymn, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," said Gyrinski.
The deputy believes that all four-points should be removed, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Gyrinski stated that the current anthem should be replaced by “God, the king of the storehouse”, and the Russian tricolour replaced by the imperial flag, says Polit.ru.
Assad called upon all efforts to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad called upon all efforts to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
“That is the essence of the question of refugees”, he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible until people are killed, as long as the bloodshed continues and people are not fully safe.
“This way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria”, Assad stressed.
It is recalled that some 500,000 migrants, including Syrians, arrived in the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest since the Second World War.
It is important that thousands of extremist militants of the Islamic State group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own terrorist cells in the EU.
The inhabitants of the German city organized a festival for refugees.
In the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border control to contain their influx.
It is estimated that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call significant figures.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin is debuting at the Prime Minister's session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, he was expected to serve at the Prime Minister's session with great anticipation
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's session, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin would address the first of the six issues raised in the afternoon; his statement would likely be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speeches at the annual congress of the Tred-junion on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during the national anthem on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a public anthem drew attention
The Spokesperson, Mr. Corbin, stated that he had been “standing in a respectful silence” and recognized “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow cabinet, informed BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “independent” on his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, echoing differences in economic, defence and international policy, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also “peak” in Labour parties following Mr. Corbin's appointment to a post in the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Tred Union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at lifting the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadowy Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that the party had a “full clarity” that it was only in opposition to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party to meet David Cameron at the Courier Box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, said that he had “attracted collective resources” to raise ideas for Mr. Cameron and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Eilington North County said that questions to the Prime Minister caused too much confrontation, and that he would also refrain from cutting back and exchanging numbers, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economics in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on questions of the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the John Burke Municipal Chamber to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of the “marker bag” often associated with the procedure of questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leadership ' s views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Done in Yoburg" Homeless Young People Learning From Photographers
Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for the homeless.

Pound Sterling rises as wages rise in Britain
The pound grew against the backdrop of salary growth in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to an earlier period of forecasting the possible increase in quotations.
The pound of sterling grew by more than 1% compared to the dollar, amounting to $1,5505, and by 0.84 per cent compared to the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller shares increased by 20 per cent thanks to the purchase proposal from AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest beer companies, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares increased by 0.9 per cent in the light of encouraging news from the competing group of Lux Richemont producers.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - were growing again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had managed to get $2.5 billion through stock placement, which was done under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's stock of paper and packaging materials was the leader of the drop in the index - 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sell".
The shares of JD Sports grew after a sports clothing supplier reported an 83 per cent increase in income to six months of tax to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the cost of labour costs, he says.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the pressures of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food provider launched a bottom-up campaign to protect the market share of IGAs in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social networks and on Adelaide Show events.
Retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the producer of ice cream Simmo's from Dansboro, are joining the campaign, which offers tastings at IGA shops and shop owners who sell discounted fixed customers tickets to the South Australian Football League.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September - the day when this wholesale provider of food, alcohol and household goods will hold its annual investor ' s strategy day.
Much has been put on the line since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are known to be committed to the usual routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the UA and 24 per cent in the WA, compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will cut off 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first store, taking over all the players present, but mostly from independent Reuters.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGAs can lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash 250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
Loss of income and sales of food at a high level of fixed costs Metcash could cost companies around 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, according to Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found out that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is estimated that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager, Hamish Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash " could most likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA declined from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company supplies to IGA's producers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational deleveraging and the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spends more than $150 million a year to balance retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths in thousands of positions per week and assist IGA producers in redesigning trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of company food.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris says that price equations and remodeling of trading venues are gaining turnover, and he hopes that the company will gain an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his conduct than criticism, says President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Kokkinakis, a junior in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was reluctantly at the centre of attention because of the shameful burn of Kirjos with Stan Varynka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge at the high school had to double-read Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Varrinka had to put it on Kiryos' shoulder blades, and I had to put it on this guy's shoulder blades."
Since the last time Kokkinakis was seen cracking a rocket after a car accident in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly has been loyally defending Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in solitary confinement in the Davis Cup against Britain semifinals.
"I am very much concerned about one thing, namely that the Tanasi have been involved in a conflict," Hilly said.
He really broke the rocket when he dropped his leg on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the rocket when the hopes went down, and I know Tanassi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at himself in pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, he fits the team well, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's trained intensively, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated in dignity.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing that the "double consent" was the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra boy to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the [Kyrós] disputes," Hilly said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, which is proven by people like Federerer and Murray, he's growing up in front of the audience, he's made a number of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to take him out of the limelight for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
In a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants inwardly.
There were riots at the border, hundreds of migrants collapsing in border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted harshly.
When trapped indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing from armed violence at home broke down tents and settled in that area.
However, dissatisfaction grew.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for a special purpose.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, as more and more come from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc was unable to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to bear overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece overcrowded, and expressed the hope that an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, would be admitted in the coming month or at the end of the year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested an emergency summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for prompt action by Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday ' s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, enabling them to block the roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Siyarto said that his country was also planning to set up a ban on the barbed wire at the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the blockade at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work on the completion of the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “restrict” and the border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are victims of wars in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people who arrive in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, rather than refugees who are victims of hostilities that are entitled to protection, and this view diverges sharply with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-foot (13-foot) bar from a thorny wire built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking in persons.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency”, said a representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We clearly understand that illegal border crossing is a crime.
The formal parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are at the border, have been there for several days to observe the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Derd Bakondi, the National Security Adviser of Orban, reported the capture by the authorized authorities of 45 persons trying to cross the border at the border itself, and 15 others within the country.
They crossed the border, broke the ban, were currently in police custody and were charged with administrative violations under new laws.
Authorities are quick to restore the barrier.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings at the border with Serbia, driving a railway car wrapped in a barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
The riots broke out at the main roadway along the border of Ríoske, Hungary, as Hungarians housed a service room for people inside a metal container, and crowds pushed each other to break in.
Some 20 people were able to enter, and thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-pronged advantage in the democratic race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is receiving support from 15 per cent of the primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say what they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than in their support of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderate, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men had fallen significantly, and Sanders was only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by democratic voters under 50 years of age has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on the same page.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton overtakes Sanders for a two-digit number among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 per cent of primary democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters share their leader, Donald Trumpe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question, why do they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she needs experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about her association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called agreement on issues and the chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third believes he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see second among party candidates, the primary democratic voters in most cases called Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of them say they'd choose Byden the second, that's more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month.
By this rate, Biden had a significant backlog in second place, but the percentage of those who considered him the most likely candidate had increased.
However, in responding to the question that most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some of the key characteristics of primary voters from their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Byden as honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Byden of all three is a man of integrity, and Clinton's strong side is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of him.
The primary democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Byden as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion on Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's personal mailbox and server are continuing to be held by her Secretary of State, most primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not affected their general view of her.
But it's a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but are satisfied with only about a third.
Public opinion on this was shared in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers the voters to be honest and trustworthy from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not find it credible and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not find Trump fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good marks by leadership.
Of the six protestors, Biden, Carson, and Bush are showing the best results in honesty.
Most people in Sanders see an honest person more than they don't, but, like Carson, many people don't have any opinion of him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to a national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trump closely.
Ben Carson went to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times survey.
Two of these candidates took half the vote in a new poll, leaving all the others looking for support under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support the mass trade, which increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups by tightening Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Cassic, have gone back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support has dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and Senator Marko Rubio of Florida together take third place with 6 per cent.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in polls - showing support for 19 per cent of Republicans, 32 per cent of support for Trump.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's increased support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a freshman at Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual in Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five persons.
“P Delta Psi brothers from Baruch College of New York attacked Chan Michael Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital on time, which led to his death”, the police reported.
Officials say that a student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and they were waiting for an hour before he was taken to the hospital, talking to the police.
However, they found time to change Dengue's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At that moment, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be rescued, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have been affected by fraternity rituals, since at least one student dies each year since 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in his statement.
Brethren and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jurors tended to charge the third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a novice and a criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, so does it,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will fall, the yield of the bonds will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take, and how long it's going to take.
In particular, history does not explain much about time for the economy.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first raise and for 86 months.
The severity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the United States Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there's a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole vanity surrounding the increase in rates is exaggerated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve, with the advent of the global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the “price money” era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economic specialist at Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to be more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
This is how some areas of the economy may have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of an increase in rates may lead to volatility for some time.
In raising the rate, however, the effects are usually not so dramatic.
“It does not seem that stock revenues will stall for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy” - said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - towards a rise in rates, remains fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (average growth 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal state of average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Chief Trade Strategy Officer at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche said that the result for securities tended not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate-up stage, and the income from shares began to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to it.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at almost the lowest point during the lifetime of a higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of higher rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
An increase in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question of “if it will be different this time”, said Deutsche.
Market participants have been preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve System for the whole year, with their views tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
So far, many policy specialists and economists believe that FOMC was able to approve the increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rising rates to this day have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage at GDP, which closes peaks that pre-recession very quickly after the start of recovery,” says the report.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest one that the Federal Reserve system has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, only it has been 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects higher rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to what is being done for shares.
The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income appears to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the yield of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche reported.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will bring long-term and short-term bond yields closer by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in this climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says Katy Jones, a flat income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system's policies.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of a stronger monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, income curves have increased flater, credit lines have increased, volatility has increased - all market characteristics have increased with the Federal System's policies tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their major business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International companies with multiple debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt is more expensive in financial terms.
"History shows that "quality" shares show efficiency above the market within three months after the initial increase in rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with stable financial status have bypassed companies with instability as a result of each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility shares also showed better efficiency than low quality shares, on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high interest rate will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Donors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how quickly this would happen.
BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM - approves a member of Parliament from the conservatives Andrew Bingham
Parliamentary member Andrew Bingham of the conservatives criticized the station for "decreasing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just collided with Brits.
Parliamentary College Damien Collins, who attacked The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said Parliamentary Leader, urging the television company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
Parliamentary member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that the public radio station seemed to be "stupid" and becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to me -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year look like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that came to mind first, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 is that I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his commitment to live performances and the creation of music is not really going to be compared to anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations have to work a lot harder to attract audiences than in the past because British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who was attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical show of talents that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media at an indicative price of £22 million.
See why this programme is often discussed in the absence of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which included Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own stable" the next time she launches an entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed down as much as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7 per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile shopping devices
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could have contributed to the deterrence of spending
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of online sales alignment after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The overall cost of online shopping in August showed minimal growth since it began to be fixed in 2000, with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there are now signs of online sales alignment after the latest data show only a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and come back by 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it under any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the canvas, and you can see the decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average buyers rushed to computers to make use of profitable offers, thus destroying a number of vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers engage in a real fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound of sterling from every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold via Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims guard the dead when the tap falls in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is subject to sanctions.
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 people killed in the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the damage to the tap.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the collapse of the crane on the main Mecca mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funerals captured the passageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sealing procession passed by a sacred place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the pilgrims.
The bodies were given for burial, and at the same time the king of Saudis executed a construction company owned by the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died in the collapse of the crane at the Main Mosque were carried along the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj in Mecca will continue because thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left an arrow of tap raised in a broken tap.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the Saudi Press State Agency states that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the destruction.
The English news agency did not report on this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been banned from going abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flocked to go to Hadj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate harmonization with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca's Main Mosque, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by the Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden family has been among the close family members of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been leading the major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Usama Ben Laden, was a changeling son whose family gave up in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rains just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is mandatory for every working Muslim for at least once in his life.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased and the same amount irreversibly mutilated.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail's main city correspondent
They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to use a hammer or paint walls, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring masters to perform uncomplicated housework.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home network of services, reported that this trend is followed by a substantial influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmanship, while closing 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop were made by weak-sex representatives.
At present, most of the staff are men.
She said that recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households made up of single women who were more engaged in building their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "We still have men working mostly in our stores.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women driving the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers team by achieving equal numbers of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and Finance.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the closing costs, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Decision-making time at the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is observing a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank that discusses the adoption of an important decision within two days, whether to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey by 80 Reuters economists revealed that just over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe that it would keep the rate at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach that the main bank can move away from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, the leading member of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy is working effectively, the economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that changes should be prepared, but everyone said that they were confident that all chances were against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" is being chanted by hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for displaced persons.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to tap other routes to the European Union.
One of them is across the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading for the town of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without interruption.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to treat them humanely.
But that's already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone will manage it, and a much smaller country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is relentless:
If anyone calls himself a refugee, he must fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already set up a 175-ticilometer roadblock on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to set up the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis has been part of the centre-right governments for several years, which, according to the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by stepping down the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy was being compared to it in a popular way.
What changed during that time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and an economic growth perspective.
The country now again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors have left because Mr. Cyprus has driven them away.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become significantly worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with most Greek citizens concerned.
But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRISU.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The point is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still under way, political forces and all ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme on which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only cooperation between political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new Prime Minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that the EU would have.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had it not been for a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures have been the result of Mr. Cyprus negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants order in the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, as we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cypriot ministers had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we had tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, covering the sharp corners in it.
We have made progress in reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency situations.
The market fell, and no potential buyers were seen willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
At the time, I was a speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that formed the government majority at the time.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we have managed to lead the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has been moving throughout Greece in recent weeks.
How do you feel about this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
The reason is that the SIRISA Government did not act in the same way.
In such matters, it is necessary to act ahead, because if the problem strikes you, only emergency measures remain.
And now we're in this situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS had only done more in seven days than Mr. Cypras had done in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which is being provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, calling for an EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the war in Syria, victims of any extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will follow the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you.

The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “sorry” of the first murder and wished to “return everything back”, the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in Gotje, Mississippi, report that a geography and public science teacher at the University of Delta called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday, and he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he said, "There's a dog in the house that doesn't touch anybody," but he's probably upset.
The police asked about the caller's name, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry to bring it all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was implying an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of a “loving triangle”.
About Prentiss responded as a "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "uncomfortable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the San Gerald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to jail."
The night the police caught him on Route 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Happiness
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his many years of life to Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United left for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Battle of the Champions League, where Manchester United lost his PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is concerned about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during the reckless execution of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penal zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated.
It's terrible--the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, went through a lot of difficulties and started to play fantastic, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in a group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he had not received a red card and had not been assigned a penalty.
Arbitrator Nikola Riccolly didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge for yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged lift.
On his Twitter, Shaw writes, "Thanks to all of you for your messages, don't tell me how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll come back even stronger than I was."
On the subject: Manchester United is having an accident with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV
An English defender will have an additional incentive to make amends to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, the PSV coach, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any player comes out with a trauma like this, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the enemy.
Moreno broke his legs when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gaul at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's having a hard time right now because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious trauma, you're not feeling well," Koku said.
I didn't get a chance to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball flying in another direction, so it looked like it touched him, but I didn't see a rat under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure it.
I'm really sorry, and I'm really sorry.
Andres Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loraks?
Each parent quickly adopts one thing: if your child likes a book, it will take some time before you know it almost automatically.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question by a representative of a holiday company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a tale with an environmental bias written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary published on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "This is a funny, moving, unusual story with a strong message that I love to read to my children because it always shows some kind of image or message that we miss."
And it would be a good thing, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to relay the contents of the book, but in fact, he tells the story of the one-name film that was made in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a rather short original story.
"In the surrounding high walls of the town of Allyunjville, where there was no greenery and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dream, by fulfilling her desire to see the present tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suzu (the present name of Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If this seems not sufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a brief account of the story of Lorax, published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded high walls of the town of Svemnožville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how he destroys the environment by a greedy tree cutter and the "all-consumer" of Nachodkins, despite Loraks' protests (the name of the book) is a ridiculous creature with a mustache who "speaks on behalf of the trees".
Most likely, this simple PR task was entrusted to the performer, who had never read a book about Lorax 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had allegedly been received from Cameron ' s office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been made.
There was obviously a risk for Adam Litt not to enter the Companion England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the compendium that England chose for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series, which happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players in it who are virtually taking spindle balls and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012 but only youthful positives.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bowling alley, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown test-level figure, is an attack option.
What's more, Adam Litt got out of assembly England on a test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lit is, of course, difficult for me, his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality was that cricket players were judged by the judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've already said this before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of hundred, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of assembly England, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he failed to show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before the batsman of the test cricket makes an impression is a difficult question.
Lith played seven games, like Sam Robson did before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about was that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lithuania was in its best shape, but this lost opportunity was in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman that I appreciate very much.
He's an unpredictable cricketist, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club early this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was already something.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but of course that will depend on the composition of the team in the OAU.
The thought of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would allow us to introduce an additional spinner, keeping four speed bouleers, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I can't see the reason why a beatin' player can't hit a ball in there, and that lion already showed that he's a damn good cricketist.
Moën may not be exactly what it takes for his County Woostershire, but he's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 third-Betsman test matches before being the opening in 2001.
He won three hundred straight away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a spare spinner, and in my brief communication with him, he has proved to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- on average 31 with a bit and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky wager, but among the backers who vote for a little bit, and the voters choose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the assembly, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a master move.
He's one of the best guys in the game that's going to bring her the richest experience she's ever had in all possible circumstances and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and a relentless pace in the setup.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they said earlier, can give new powers to the team.
Colley's teammate Darema Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break for Australia, and I, for example, do not experience any problems.
Although not all agree, coaches and players who choose players do not set a schedule.
And you have to remember how players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of Britain's exit from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unwarranted policy to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without considering the selection of a brilliant Jeremy- "This is yes or no?" - Corbin is the leader of Labourists or TUC's disapproval of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the day that, in the current situation of the EU, experiencing a variety of crises, not all of which are its own production, some of the countries parties are fed up with the British egocentric agenda of shriveling concessions and undermining arrangements for changes they do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it the selfie program Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are driving around the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves in the background of a well-known local monument, in or without a local celebrity, then coming home and saying that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to keep Britain in touch with the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the red-headed ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they do not care, whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very wary chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, as she deteriorated for the Tetchers (11 years old), Mitterran (14) and Kola (16).
The head of France, François Alland, stands before the election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon receive a nationalist right-wing government, Spain left-wing.
It's hard to see them coming out of the skin to help self-british people whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving Britain -- which they don't want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan the issuance of deliberately useless SNP-style milestones during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to boost Britain's EU exit process, my friend assumes.
"Revision was an idea-fix" and "Britain received nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Flint Street can be, and how sceptically the media magnates are against the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry into 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may be sad to remember Boris Johnson, an entrenched Europortunist who celebrated his "direct EU bananas" by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his bullshit, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a wide-ranging company of fearsome tax collectors, foreign telephone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you were in a cell with a big gorilla, you had to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than to Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair was favoured by the abolished EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But a mile away from Jeremy Corbin, who friendly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he doesn't have time to waste on me anymore -- it looks like he's risking repeating Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott Murdoch' strategy -- a mistake and then and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press, not with me, but quite precisely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin in Europe is what I call delicately evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Ukip trend and a wider range of “small English foreigners” among the latter may say yes.
It's the same thing that Hillary Benn, but not Bennith, said on radio and TV this week, and his internal Boy Scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment to bear John McDonnell as "tiny" minister of finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old man fought hard on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet, without going too far or losing his office in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in all circumstances" is Benn's phrase, not what McDonnell said, not what J.K. told the Perams and members of parliament at a private meeting Monday night, in general opinion.
In order to inform the Democrat and his "boyfriend" Korbin - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, especially in the social network watershed, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It is wise not to simply let Cameron separate from Europe, allowing him to receive as much due support from Labour during the referendum campaign as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main error of McDonnell and Corbin regarding EU membership - within the "bennithic" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer an issue of esoteric debate among left dissidents, for whom narcissism caused by a minor distinction is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his delusions about NATO-Tom Watson, it is unwavering that J.K. will not endorse the exit, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why waste political capital on Paris or Berlin - they too have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when all this may be pointless?
The United States of America is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Thor is cutting costs, which I was reminded of on Monday at a forum called British Influenza Security during lunch.
Experts criticise the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government-funded agency that e-cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were tobacco-related, according to researchers.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) with Lancet criticized evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - a “turn tower” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence”.
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed out the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet’s medical journal last month criticised the “extremely succinct argument” on which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “hard or stiff grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health — rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” based on detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, not to mention the funding he had reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of board members, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claimed funding for the industry in publications.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The head of the tobacco plant in PHE also visited the meeting.
The scientific article published by the group “excellently agrees” that there is a lack of “stricken evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCey and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell reported that PHE's statements that “at present there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's statements had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion his whole life.
All evidence suggests that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what is proved and what is not proved by this evidence, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases each year and NHS costs £2 billion per year.
By clearly pointing out that although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking, we are doing our job before the nation.
Former Chapter Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Chapter 4 of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their competitors in business would pay a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera on Alberta Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public broadcasts, which must be viewed by only a small part of the audience, at a peak time when competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessful for six years in his efforts to cooperate with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I cannot separate myself from the idea that the BBC is preparing and broadcasting broadcasts that could be broadcast by competing companies that are not receiving subsidies,” said Johnson to the members of the Communications Committee of the Lord's Chamber in order to clarify the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only keep on the air those programs that are not published and are not going to be issued by other companies.
The Voice shows up in prime slot because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one showing it again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is commonly known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly have given up a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don't think it would have humiliated the BBC somehow.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of staff members and because of their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular BBC show are echoed by the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on MacTaggart's memory in Edinburgh in 2003, invited the BBC to sell East Enders series.
Johnson noted that more niche broadcasts of the BBC of a public nature “continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be argued in the Hangese sermons justifying the income from the 4 billion pounds licence fee: “yes, of course, we are making all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching.”
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the Johnson licensing assembly, the committee was informed: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds of big money, I'm curious, they think because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small part of BBC material was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the term “information, education and entertainment”.
On the issue of the Elstein partnership, he noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as the "Remenade Concerts" (some of which he said were on TV) and also join the alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Sonogenesis allows you to control your brain cells with sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement at a time when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have released worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes alter the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses have an effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new method called sonogenesis, the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to trigger certain cells of the brain, heart and muscle, and the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could eventually replace the deep stimulation of the brain — an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Calasani discovered that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate the worm system.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and trigger the cells associated with them, reports a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create the nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so that their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, the sound waves were enhanced by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to that used in “optogenetics”, a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenesis may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that comes to the right part of the brain on the optics, low frequency ultrasonic waves unobstructedly pass through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to be delivered inside the skull box.
“We believe that in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal for time,” said Calasani.
He added that the methodology could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising is being mocked by the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Awesome killer drones!
Naked iron candalas!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise oaks that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
There is no doubt that this advert of the largest international arms exhibition is a ferocious travesty prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “push” weapons to the repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems at the ExCeL Centre in Doklands.

But the special campaign also results in the sudden emergence of multiple posters at bus stops and on subway trains that require another look at them.
"An important announcement coming through DLR from 15 to 18 September?" was written on one of them in a London subway with a picture of a DLR line turning into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their work at the "The Hard Design Museum" in Banky Disneyland Park.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a six-pound set of wrenches, which “provides access to about a third of the advertising space at the world’s bus stops”.
London's transporters are not happy with such “vandalism” as unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Unit.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms poster welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty was screened more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, which works pro bono, with graphic designer and audio artist also working for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the commercial silence around the arms exhibition - with a pass on ExCel - and thought, "Let's make them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating a more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “filling its houses with bright colors and animation was a more exciting activity”.
"They have incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action to ensure that this dusty equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the issue of arms exhibition goes from inside ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically in euphemistic products.
In the Saab press release, she disclosed an order from the U.S. Army to AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting.
It includes a “non-comparable cumulative charge that brings unrivalled prohibition within the target”.
No matter what he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
Eleven years have passed since I moved to a dormitory as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the many, long complaints of others.
Basically, what I've learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm may vary from a little nervous to an absolutely frightening one.
He's telling people where you're from, whether you've taken academic leave or where you've spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin, or why you're "honestly, loving or hating Marmathe," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I'm gonna be at home."
Take a break.
And help others to relax too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It helps you find people you like, not those you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had gums on fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, midnight cinemas, and common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and improve their underwear.
More on the subject: Don't even think about starting university school when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room must be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of satanization from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to feel when the student is tired of communicating and not knocking at him, but texting him.
By the way, knock, do it.
One of the guys in my dormitory followed the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Friends' factories with baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of Bake-Off's popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and deliver a plate of chocolate cookies, it's not that weird anymore, it's not like the 1950s, it's like, "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Poorly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing is a typical crime in college dormitories.
Of course, it's stealing someone's chicken, but is it stealing a little milk for tea?
Get rid of the milk owner.
Rather, he will offer you a measure of self - control, even if it is a source of rage inside.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to deal with it more adultly than my neighbor, who poured in her milk fluid to wash the dishes to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noises that prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people in the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to cut the sound of drums and bass guitars, since it was 3:00 in the morning and she had the exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she mercifully let him sleep for two hours, and then she turned her music down and locked the door behind him for a three - hour exam.
Was it not romantic for your future husband to settle in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before you bite your elbows, if you took your neighbor as your future husband, got involved, broke their relationship, and should you see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your mutual friends on his side?
Of course, you won't order your heart - but if the hot neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool off your own dust a little bit.
At a worrisome moment when you realize someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the game and the weeds is thinner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns into the opposite in seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting lesson in security by hiding something, but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the other door and put the keys in the glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't glue other people's things with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by entering Settings, selecting General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you jump and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after installation, when an error has been reported telling them that “The update of the annex has not been possible”.
In order to avoid this, users are encouraged to wait either until recovery is quiet or to try to update via iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removing applications to increase free space, but Apple minimised the likelihood of this action by reducing the update size, and also simplified implementation by means of a special utility that proposes to remove applications and reinstall them after the process has been completed.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or near the charger when you update it to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone during the process may lead to a failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary John Kerry called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support given by Moscow to President Assad only exacerbated the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague about this, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Assad by Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and extension of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power,” said the US Department of State.
They also noted that Kerry had again stressed the commitment of the United States to the fight against the Islamic State within the coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in its efforts to confront the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what action Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
After all, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come up: “When the President decides that a telephone call with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself believes Russia's decision to increase its support for the Assad regime by “loss rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support from Assad would only make things worse.
“But he did not listen to my warnings — and as a result the situation worsened,” said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
Mine-economic development is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - Mineconomy, Mintransu RF, Mintulture, MID, MCS, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad -- about €200 million per year go to the execution of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The economic development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe on the amendment of the List of Goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes, which provides for the granting of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sport.
In the view of the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of a yacht in the coastal areas of the country, Lashkina noted.
The matter was brought to the attention of the Customs, Non-Tariff Regulation Sub-Commission on Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of Mineconomy, the proposed measure of full conditional release on importation was essentially a concession.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the sub-Commission ' s meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with the member States of the EEA, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of external economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in the fields of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring equipment, drilling equipment, costumes and decoration, mobile laboratories and master skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious rites.
In the Mintrans Press Service, the RF "Investigations" said that they had prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the operation and exit of small-scale, sporting sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
Mintrans has been entrusted to the captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure that the simplified procedures for the operation of small-scale, sporty sailing and recreational vessels are applied to the seaport and that the listed ships are taken out of the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the Russian Federation to approve the boundaries of the Crimea seaports.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, the orders had already been adopted and the rest were in the process of being agreed upon, the press office noted.
In the view of Mintrans, the host, classification and inspection, State registration of small craft used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to sail precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
Looking south at Italy and France, it is an ever-increasing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coastline is a low-interest, the only piece that can be used round-the-clock is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelendzika, Novorossia, Anapa.
But the great difficulty in this area is that the rules of the border service are very strict: a lot of permits are needed to get out on the yacht.
Besides, inside Russia, you're going to have to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel and then there's a problem where to take it, says Nordmarine Sales Director Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the start of the crisis, the demand for yachts has declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for financial sector development.
This was reported by the international organization ' s press service.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and had seen the first signs of stabilization in the World Bank.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government had approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, passing on the RIA Novosti.
In prisons, separate transgender blocks are requested.
The Federal Corrections Service (FSIN) Public Council for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons in October 2015 will discuss the possibility of establishing separate blocs in colonies for transgenders and transvestites.
A member of the council Vladislav Grib told the news about this.
In his view, depending on the total number in Russia of unsexed convicted persons, it was possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) in domestic prisons in the prospect of creating a special colony for transgenders.
However, Vladislav Grib points out that it is only possible to determine whether to serve the punishment of citizens in such isolated places after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations to prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving the sentence.
According to him, the proposed practice was successful abroad: the SIZO (where the accused are prior to the judgement of the court) had separate transgender cells and the correctional facilities had special units.
Today is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous to them, it is suffering for their families and the sea problems for FSI staff.
The humiliation of the trances by the cellists is guaranteed," said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of criminals with an uncertain sex, it is also necessary to expect to be distributed.
SIZOs are not necessarily needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
According to Grib, 50 or 100 persons could be held in the bloc, and if a specialized corps was established in Russia alone, prisoners of transgender detention could be sentenced to serve from any region.
Citizens are held in SIZO at the crime scene, so the proceeds of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, and this is the practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes - says Grib.
As a reminder, law enforcement officials had not been able to decide before which inmate, male or female, was arrested for drug possession by 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozukov (known as Alina Davis) and therefore the man with a virgin was not arrested.
He's been released under a non-departure signature at home.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the mechanism for transgender content in SISO and colonies in Russia is not yet available.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolay Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender punishment, noting that it is also possible to define people abroad - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the issue of security in homosexual prisons,” said Alexeiev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and homosexuals, more so than transgenders in prisons.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubted that there would be many citizens in Russia willing to pretend to be transexuals in order to get to a different colony.
Of course, a medical examination may be introduced before placing people in a transgender colony, but not everything is always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change the sex, said Alexeyev.
A man can feel anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgenders, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and see their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in RF Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of sentences for convicted persons.
A commission is being set up -- it's a matter of sexology, psychiatrists have long-term observations, it's not one test based on which high-precision detention is made.
Today's mental health facilities allow it.
Therefore, even before the change of sex, potential patients always undergo such tests - they show exactly whether sex replacement with surgery is the necessary measure - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicted persons, since on average it takes a month to do so.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of creating separate units for transgenders, also doubts that it would be appropriate in the current economic context to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical expertise, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate that there is no official statistics, but given that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, it is possible to say that transgenders are even less, and those who have this deviation and who are still committing crimes are very few," Lordcipanidze said.
At present, homosexuals, transgenders can obtain separate conditions of detention at the request of the colony administration.
Mikhail Antipov won the world junior chess championship.
In Hunta Mansiysk, the World Cup for Juniors finished for up to 20 years.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was able to still drive the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Doudou, who seemed confidently to go to the title.
The girls were celebrated by a Ukrainian chess player named Natalie Bux.
The World Chess Championship, held since early September in Hunta Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament, seemed to have lost almost all its intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan Kshishtof Duda, who had issued a series of four victories (surrendering on the Swiss system in 13 tours), had certainly taken the lead.
Given that Duda was the favorite of the championship, and in general considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss his winnings seemed very small.
And even when Douda reduced the turnover and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the title fight.
Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win your party.
Plus, this commitment to victory could certainly have affected the game of a Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He had certainly dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he had to wait for his party to finish the Douda meeting with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, a Polish chess player reduced his opposition to the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipas and Douda obtained an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible points, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hunta Mansiy Autonomous District, whose Governor, Natalya Komarov, has traditionally paid great attention to the development of chess in the region, has given him the main prize.
And in the competitions, the girls of the intriguing ending didn't happen.
The tournament leader - Natale Buxe (Ukraine) - was satisfied not to lose the title in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with 0.5 points behind.
The extractor changes the regional structure.
The company brings the Privalzsky and Ural regions together into one major Walz-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Director-General Mikhail Slobodan pointed out, the changes are being made “to remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with Russia 24, Mr. Slobodan explained that they intended to reduce “ten percent” of staff in Russia.
The supervisor checked 78 Moscow breakfast Burger King and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant on the Wolokolam highway was fined 50,000 rubles, and the Grand Tull Street facility was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations had been resolved.
43 breakfasters violated the requirements of the premises.
Among other violations, poor sanitary and hygienic facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, some of the facilities have been found to be intestinal group bacteria.
Franchise on the Burger King brand belongs to the "Burger Rus" company of the "Schokoladnica" network owner Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 breakfasts in Russia.
Igor Artemiyev, head of the FAS, said that the department against the 10 per cent indexation of freight tariffs and the provision of state support services, as requested by OAS RZD.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of the indexation, now they want 10%, and then they want multi-billion-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We're saying it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save money, give up expensive individuals, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “much stricter” proposals, which were currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full $300 million share path option, the gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the cost of issuing shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations) which may be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until 3 October to implement the option or request a supplement.
The details of the talks in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Kizyl Polymetal project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of Housing Policy of Minstroy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
“We understand that this is nowhere to be done, so we are developing a mechanism,” said the official.
The drafts of the Citizen Kane screenplay will be put on the market.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported on plans to launch a black version of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works by director, screenwriter and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Calabas on 29 September and will present three black scenarios, each costing $20-30 thousand, the AP transmits.
The first of the nuns, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevic, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Minprom trade: targeted food aid will not be a card analogy in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, said that the targeted food aid programme would not be an analogy to the food distribution card system in the USSR.
This includes modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
In particular, we should not confuse the proposed product cards with a reflection of the past times of total deficit, a card distribution system that regulates the number of products received.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," says TASS, Mr. Evtuhov.
Previously, "U" wrote that the programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor had been introduced into the Government.

President Rosgostracha wants to divorce his wife.
A well-known source reported by RAPSI that the president of the insurance company Rosgosstrah Danil Hachaturov had filed with the Moscow court for divorce of the marriage of designer Uljana Sergienko.
The trial will begin on 16 September with the trial of the justice of the world.
Danil Hachaturov requests that his marriage be dissolved and that the property be shared.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that the claim for the division of property had not been filed and would be brought before the district court.
RJD President Alexander Bobreshov is leaving his post.
USO Vice-President "Russian Railways" (RZD) for corporate security Alexander Bobreshov is leaving the company, reporting "Interfax", referring to the source.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, RZD Board Chairman Arkady Dvorkovic said that the issue of withdrawal from RZD was initiated by Alexander Bobresov, the new head of Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the change in personnel in RCD management is not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, "U" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunina OAS RZD led the first Deputy Minister of Transport, Oleg Belozerov, who was in charge of the financial unit.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: a new system of freight tariffs will be established within a year and a half.

This year's study by the Association of Russian Managers, Top-1000 Russian Managers, is published on the 16th occasion.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of the Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in sectors and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of the rating last year.
Last year ' s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies that could be added to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to identify the following managers of the company ' s functional areas: the financial director, the commercial director, the marketing director, the staff director, the IT director, the public and corporate liaison director, the director of relations with the authorities, the director of corporate management.
Each proposed expert shall be invited to participate in the rating and shall be given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on a sectoral basis is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry, machine-building, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and may submit their assessments on the criteria proposed for each function.
The rating methodology is based on the “Best choice of best” principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows for the best possible assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All eligible candidates for this year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the past year ' s rating are invited to the meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of senior managers and eight commissions to approve managers of functional areas.
At expert commissions meetings, it is proposed that the lists submitted be approved alphabetically (places remain strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or updated according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian and the rules of “U”.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfort rate for the investment is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business lending market in January-April this year has applied for 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Following the panic of the end of 2014-early 2015, the lending volume of the IAS has decreased significantly.
The reason is understandable: a sharp increase in interest rates.
25-30 per cent of annual credit was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to place all its possible problems at an elevated rate in the future, from delays to non-returns, it was not possible to do so: the rates were still so cloudy.
For business, the current level of credit rates of IAS is uncomfortably uncomfortably.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their cost-effectiveness.
A 10-13 per cent rate would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and to generate attractive returns.
How much do you think the demand for credit is met?
After the fall of the CB interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have begun to seek credit much less.
Above all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future revenues.
Business today has one way out: it is necessary to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor the current results more closely, monitor the movement of funds.
At the same time, with financial resources, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the product more competitive and maintain business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the IAS lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the decline in the average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank ' s policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the issue of the decline in the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the loan price for the IAS is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that makes it necessary to raise the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of latency, companies in small and medium-sized enterprises, limited in both cash and economic behaviour, would certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's exactly how the word Mazda is spelled by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite complex for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as is any other brand model: it's non-exhaustively attractive outside, technically done inside.
Japanese is already simply because of its “Japanese” ability to link the products of the country of the rising sun to a state of total enthusiasm.
As much as you can argue in favour of cars from other countries, even in principle you will agree to these arguments, but the whole conversation will be shattered by the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people may have to love not only technology but also everything else Japanese.
Quoting Basse's move, preparing vasabi's food, collecting katanas and putting on your girlfriend's clothes, no, not in kimono, of course, but on the canons of street Japanese fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps a Japanese school form is the only form girls wear with pleasure and after school.
It has amazing qualities: both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is a grid of five horizontal lines.
But where the shape of the car changes more strongly is a new drawing of the headlamps and the rear lights, which instantly reveal the car in the car’s flow.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
Silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the appearance is strict.
You won't have to call the police.
The CX-5 driver, one of the safest in the world, can only experience the stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine shall be 175 litres- only 5.9 litres. The power generator shall be assembled exclusively by automatic transmission and complete transmission.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggins with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
After all, Mazda has made every effort to keep you out of the CX-5.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent control, the suspensions have redesigned the front and rear shock absorbers and optimized the form of the front lower lever plugs.
The complete transmission system is adapted under Russian conditions.
Road and high-speed noise levels have been reduced by 13 per cent.
A flower bath or a strip is just as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl is in the bathroom with the original picture.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role fighter.
She'll get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved construction of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both broad shoulders and for long legs - who has what.
The long legs will surely appreciate that the front of the central tunnel is now soft and does not beat the ankles in terms.
The widest range of active safety systems for Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used to identify the potential threat.
There's also adaptive lighting, and a warning about the departure from the lane, and monitoring of the dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 is one of the best trunks in the class.
A comfortable one with a minimum of performances shall contain a load of 561 litres. The rear seats shall consist of a ratio of 4:2:4 and each section shall be provided with a separate carry-on lever and shall increase the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The character's costume in Japan is called "kigurums."
Especially looks like a kigurum pajamas.
You can do anything in it!
Of course you're sleeping.
But it's also about entertaining little kids.
Or just walk down the street like that...
It's so great to be able to choose -- fun clothes, manners, or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has torn apart the atomic union.
Kiev formally refused to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the Hmelnické Nuclear Power Plant.
On Wednesday, however, the Supreme Council voted in favour of breaking the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the third and fourth clusters had been signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project had not yet been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law terminating an agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Hmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The bill was implemented only by a second vote, and for the first time, 210 deputies were supported, with a minimum of 226 votes in favour of the draft, but 234 members of Parliament spoke in favour.
The Hmelnitsk nuclear power plant established in the USSR for the initial project was to have four power blocks of 1 GB with reactors of type BWD, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on the development led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Council passed the relevant laws.
Since there was no funding in the budget of Ukraine, it was anticipated that the construction of the blocs would have to be credited to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relation to the two Kiev countries, he began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Hmelnica nuclear power plant and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have remained remained the purchase of fuel in RF for the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in force (provided about half of the country's electricity generation), as while the Ukrainian NEC "Energoat" replaced Russian supplies with something.
The plans for the construction of the Hmelnica Nuclear Power Plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS in Kiev were announced in 2014.
UN Gensek against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution” - the AP raises its answer to the question of Syria's military support by Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the IOMs of the permanent members of the UNSC later this month.
"The meeting will take place in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Genstaba of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovski, reported that Genstab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future military base in Syria.
There are no plans so far.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanowski.
Previously, "U" reported that the United States did not trust President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who claimed that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the Russian Federation.

In the OSCE PA, a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians is reported.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
“What I know: there is a meeting planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and the “return to the normal life of our countries”.
On the question of whether the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the Normandy format or in the form of a contact group on the OSCE PA site, was currently possible, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had taken place, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, policies say that any kind of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, Leonid Kuchma, ex-president of the country, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics had in principle not changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod electoral commission summarized the outcome of the municipal duma election by municipal district, assigning 12 parliamentary mandates to be distributed on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were made by representatives of the KFOR, who accused the election of “covering the counterfeits”.
No comments were received by the opposition.
In addition, the Russian Communist Party refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of charges for the construction of multi-house houses.
The City Election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million voters were listed in Lower Novgorod, 746.7 000 were issued as ballot papers and 268,000 were voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots have been declared invalid and 24 have been lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties depending on the votes they received.
On the “One Russia” list, six seats are proud of Dmitry Svatkovski, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Supranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorno.
The sole mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party, Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of the CRC are allocated between Vladimir Boulanov and the Member of the State, Alexander Tarnev.
The three "Just Russia" mandates are given to Alexander Razumovski, Igor Bogdanov and Michael Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates should be determined whether they would work as city officials: if the mandate were to be waived, he would move on to the next candidate for the party.
The Chairman of the High Commissioner, Alexander Makeyev, informed the members of the commission that he was on duty to “send telegrams to Gyrinski and others” for termination of mandates.
In approving the electoral record, the representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the choir with the right to vote by the KFOR, Leonid Krasnokutsky, proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, on the order of the head of the Sormov Region administration, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located.
For a long time, neither the Gos Udma deputies nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could enter, and the resonance scandal with the storm of the doors of the administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
They were not allowed to have access until the vote had ended and the district commissions had not yet come to hand over their ballot papers.
This has been done to prevent various provocations.
“Then the chapter was corrected and all the meetings could be attended by interested persons”, paralysed a member of the Natali Andrushin election.
The Communists objected that the blocked building of the administration had been illegally detained for more than four hours by the deputy of the Zak assembly of the Ludmil Aristou district, on which a statement was sent to the investigation committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that on the day of the elections, in a number of UICs, urns began to be sealed at 6-7 a.m., placing ballot papers on them for early voting.
The members of the commissions, with the right to vote and observers, did not notify, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning, ballot papers could be thrown into the urns uncontrollably before opening the polls.
However, the mountains, which had already considered over 124 complaints for various reasons, had not found any violations involving unaccounted for ballots, according to Alexander Makeyev.
Members of the Commission and their colleague's proposal from the Righteous Russia, Maria Popova, did not support the bill of lading, with amendments to regional legislation, in order to clearly determine the opening time of the envelopes containing the ballots of the early ballot, which would then fall into the urn.
"In your own initiative, at least go to the CEC," said Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeyev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of KFOR, Sergey Samohin, fell to the President with strong accusations, shouting that he was choosing to ignore dozens of complaints and covering forgeries in the elections.
"You're not here for the rally, be careful!" the president said.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
Before 27 September, the election should approve the overall results of the elections, followed by the appointment of the first meeting of the town dunes of Lower Novgorod for the sixth assembly within three weeks.
In addition to defining the outcome of the elections, the municipal electoral commission has refused to register the Russian Communists political party for the local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for the discussion of the lower townsmen: whether they agreed that the charges for the construction of multi-house houses should be “removed immediately” and that the tariffs for housing and utilities should be “freeze until 2020”.
However, Duma lawyer Irina Maslov explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx's income is mixed, downsizing the projections for 2016.
FedEx reported uncomfortably the results of the last quarter, and the supply service giant reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increase in costs in its ground transportation unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares went up about 2.5 per cent at the preliminary bids 45 minutes before the stock market opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that she plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts assumed $10.84 under the FactSet review.
The forecast is declining despite an average rise of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in land freight charges, which will begin in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue compared to last year by reducing expenditure, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely in the light of the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
Employment plans for the holidays were announced the following day after a competitor ' s application, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 staff, about as many as they did last year.
In a neighborhood that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
Share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research by 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a decline in the international transport sector in recent years, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the boom on the Internet has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
Land transport revenues increased by 29 per cent in the last quarter, but operating revenues remained unchanged as a result of increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
Express transport received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher wage costs.
At the preliminary bids, about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange opened, it fell to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of a richly decorated room for two-story meetings, there will be a walled image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Janet L. Yellen Federal Reserve System and her colleagues should put the country ' s economic interests ahead of all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from the Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision that will announce on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to move away from the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows a steady growth of the economy, recent shocks in global financial markets can still keep the federal system's wary leaders from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise a rate of increased uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself is causing fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a downturn in the stock market if the Federal System raised the rate, provided that those who made the decisions did not ease the impact by promising that the next increase would be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by expectations that the federal system ' s policy makers would leave a bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system raised the stakes at that time," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go far into the approval of their strategy to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems to have tended to raise its rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small drop in the slow tightening financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US's recovery.
Ellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase this year, despite complaints by the liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs were slowing down in August, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at a level that is considered to be full employment in the federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the 2 per cent annual target of the central bank, the Federal System leadership stated that the temporary impact of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key factor.
The economy “can cope with and need higher rates, given the decline in the labour market”, noted Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devaluationd its currency.
The Dow-Jones average index for industrial company shares fell by 16 per cent on a record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy could hamper global growth.
The market has partly regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market indignation further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of any information on what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have turned the hooks at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former member of the Federal Reserve System.
It is now projected that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty as to the consequences for the American economy, and they have little reliable data after the latest developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a central concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account in making these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Only one suggestion from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “shuffle” its monetary expansion caused market shocks worldwide.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science”, noted Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there have been cases of excessive reactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified impact on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System lifted those reductions.
The federal reserve system should only be put at the forefront of stability in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
“You wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re afraid of rising stakes because of the turmoil in markets,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that does not change, I do not think they should be preceded by events.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
Market/store opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
The market/supply is a shop where you can buy everything at once, offering a mind-blowing selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchenettes, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to comb all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The culinary department in the shop (good and low-cost) is not far from the register and offers different options for delivery.
What's the suggestion, do you need anything -- anything Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Prices on goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes delicate Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat bench is as diverse as the fish, and the crew will clean and split the fish and even roast it for you if you want.
A beautiful part of the store is placed under an impressive ice cream department, where you will find frozen leaves of curry, bitter pumpkin and halangal, oatmeal, fish, beef blood and gallbladder, pork carcases, icra, local sausage, semi-manufacturers and much more.
Who buys: Owners and chefs of restaurants as well as families and individual buyers.
There are also shopping carts and fork loaders in the broad passageway.
Find: Fresh chakra montong near the exit.
Where is it: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, close to the outskirts of Chinatown and the city's business centre, in several blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own property, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
The Speaker of the State of Sergei Narishkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees can flow into Europe.
As the Interfax puts it, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is, is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"Someone must have assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, those miserable and destitute people who were saved from death, were seeking to enter the prosperous countries of the EU," he added.
Narishkin asked: "Did many European political leaders speak frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally devouring their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he noted.
In Narishkin ' s view, NATO is in denial of many European values and norms of international law.
“It is regrettable that Europe has long and impartially watched and looked at how NATO-stamped military boots melt down and moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law”, the speaker stressed.
Government troops and their loyal militias are confronted by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the banned terrorist group “Islamic State” joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States supports both Assad and IG rebels.
The official Damascus views such rebels as terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the West's hostility to Russia.
The claims made by the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are indeed sovereign.
That was the view expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, NTB, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another person in his place who would act for the benefit of Western countries, not for the sake of his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp upheaval of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
He said to them that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has become an enemy, a king, a dictator, who has suppressed the Russian opposition, who has come to power in a non-democratic way despite being elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the “Islamic State”.
Commenting on the permanent statements made by the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left, at the request of the people, not by decision of the United States, the Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people wanted him to stay, the President would stay, otherwise he should leave immediately”, he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was taking place with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economics and military matters.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran's providing us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out”, he explained.
With regard to the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igillian coalition known to the United States”, Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees exceeded 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was occupied by a terrorist group “Islamic State”, which was banned in Russia.
The International Coalition, headed by the United States, strikes from the air at IG positions.

This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the Department of State John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.

Borodaj called the American newspaper a slander on Strelkov.
The former President of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroday, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
That's what he told Lenty.ru in a phone interview.
The note in Washington Post is wonderful that it's completely overturned.
The former Minister of Defence, Igor Strelkov, of course, was not bound and “departed” from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without the three fur money attributed to him by various figures”, he noted.
According to Boroday, the talk with the reporter of the American newspaper was indeed about Strelkov.
“Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to withdraw from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the former head of the Government of the DNR.
Borodaj stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to the territory of Russia “bound”.
I suspect it's provocation.
If it is not provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov was leaving alone," said Borodaj.
"It's slander to both me and Strelkova," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article appeared that quoted Boroday as saying that he had taken Strelkov to Russia in a forced manner.
According to the publication, Borodaj noted that he had to tie up his associate.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with Nazi gold.
The Polish fellers began cutting trees over an underground tunnel, where, according to some data, a train with the Third Reich gold is located.
Work started on Tuesday, 15 September, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the rumors of the treasured railway composition.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be inside the train.
On 31 August, Polish Governor Tomasz Smolarz (Thomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold could not be more convincing.
However, the authorities decided to bypass the search area.
Three days earlier, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Petar Žuhovski, stated that local dignitaries “probably 99 per cent” had found the same train with Third Reich gold as legends say.
Zuhovski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the gems were found, they would be the property of the State Treasury and the treasure would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhich, reporting that they had found a train in a blocked tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The RF chief drug addict suggested banning the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
Russia's chief drug addict suggested banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful until this age”.
So he said on the live radio "Speak Moscow", commenting on the fact that the Speaker of Soufed Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army when you're 18, and you're physically ready for it.
He's been mentally prepared for a full life in society since he was 21.
“It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally matured only by the age of 21,” said Brun.
Formerly, a member of the Chamber of Public Affairs and head of the Trevaja Russia project, Sultan Hamzaev, reported to the Notices that Matvienko had supported the initiative to increase the age price of alcohol sales and “agreed with the Chamber of Public Affairs to raise this issue again on the floor of the upper chamber of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Council of the Federation to draft a bill led by Matvienko.
The Bible has been requested to verify compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirska requested the regional prosecutor ' s office to verify the Bible ' s compliance with the federal law on the protection of children against information harmful to their health and development, as reported on 16 September by correspondent Sib.Fm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he acquired a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society at the Chitai Town Shop on the Red Prospect.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that he believed violated the FZ "On the Protection of Children from Information That Harms Their Health and Development".
On 16 September, a statement was adopted for consideration by the Prosecutor ' s Office of the City of Novosibirska.
A response to the appeal of Novosibirska will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself,” commented the complainant to SIB.FM.
In addition, it is a very substantial problem that will bring about a society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it had never done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Union of Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full feeding during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants with breast-skinned breast-skinned images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended that the daily calorie level be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study has shown that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor of Medical College Baylor in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the gene expression of children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Regrettably, the negative impact of malnutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, a school bus passed through.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not get off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, there was a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by a schoolboy.
There was panic among the students as a result of the emergency.
Some children began to cry and run along the sidelines.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, it was a miracle that no one was harmed except one train passenger who suffered minor injuries.
Accident damage was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a match with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with a knockout victory by Magali in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a brain injury.
Its condition was assessed as critical and was connected to the life-support apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in destruction.
He has two children left.
This is already the second case of Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died of injuries in the ring.
AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, in its view, to prohibit it at all.
I understand it's not intentional,' said Steven Parris, Vice President.
But the way boxing is now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets a hemorrhage or a brain injury that leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
Speaker of the State of the Russian Federation, Sergey Narishkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He stated this at the OSCE PA session in Ulanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable, as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on OSCE PA participants to re-establish Russian and EU partnerships.
Let's put morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to democratic peace.
"Double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group”, said Narishkin.
He also noted that OSCE should be commended.
“This is almost the only common site where we are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine”, the politician stressed.
It is recalled that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will be extended until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple of days.
World Champion of Light Athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the European Command Championship at a distance of 110 metres, setting several records, and becoming the world champion, the first in the history of the national barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking the third place in the general record.
"New Reports" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergei, isn't the season over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to play the World Military Games, which will take place in Korea in October, and then I'll think about my rest.
It's true that I'm going to be home now, in Barnaul, and being home is still a different state.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
By the end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passion after the main start of the season has erupted, the burden of responsibility no longer weighs down.
You can enjoy yourself, relax.
Plus, you know, vacations are coming up soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness always accumulates by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent crossings, relocations - all this does not go unnoticed for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I have emotions on the rise.
What are you doing? I'm just happy!
By the time you finished the world championship in Beijing, are you coming back often?
It does.
And you journalists don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that a bad athlete who lives on an old victory is turning his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed winning a couple of days, and have to move on.
Has the preparation for this wonderful season been much different from the usual?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained at home in Barnaul, then at the congregations, then at home again.
It's just as usual.
But the coach was assigned to try to get to a new level I've never been to.
Almost all winter time was spent building a base.
They ran a bunch of crosses, they did exercises in general physical training, which included both thrust and adjectives, and we got our backs.
Then they took up the barrier training, and they did a lot of engineering.
Did they follow the way the rivals acted?
I'm always trying to do that. There's no problem in the Internet era.
I saw the winter champion of Europe, and there the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier!
I just thought we should do something about this company.
Every time you started this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you any confidence?
I've got all the last seasons going on about the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always unfolding my form gradually.
The only thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for feats, and the competitions don't always get you ready.
How was the Olympics in London, for example?
To be honest, that semifinal run (Shubenkov couldn't make it to the finals.
It was pretty good, it could really have escaped from 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at that time, he would have become a bronze Nazir of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I wanted to go to the finals very much.
And he's gone straight from tomorrow, in the pre-games.
That's when I realized that breaking and breaking your head means not running anywhere at all.
Two years later, the world championship in Moscow was already in the finals at the best possible time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I was very eager to win the gold!
How do you manage to keep your head up while you're at it?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't have to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust to the process, not the result, but the process, it's much easier.
It's the best thing to do when you feel like you're running, and it's like you're doing it yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after their first major success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have there ever been such thoughts?
Home's still better.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have conditions better, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
Have you been with Klevtsov for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, since he got into athletics.
Actually, first I was training with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped three times in length.
The children's fight was -- when they throw the ball, they jump long from the spot...
At 14, I tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first run, it has been possible to comply with the standards of the second adult class.
That's what I did.
There's never been a fear of barriers?
One day, I made a deal with them.
But technology has always had to work very hard.
He's over the same race as he's been through!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technique has to be kept spinning - so that at night I can wake up, I get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw you run in Beijing says it was a very nice run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my errands, and I couldn't stay here.
But efficiency needs to be continued, there is no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid now that winning a year before the Olympics will be a heavy burden?
As they say, I will try to live up to expectations.
Once you've chosen this path, you have to go all the way.
My coach likes to say that if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra cargo.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand their bread isn't food. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't have a flag on me, and the same thing, a million times I've said it here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard, I've been hit by something else.
All my pseudo-friends have been missing for a second.
The press that I'm being subjected to is so strong that even I, who looks like a kid, thinks the white people are getting cold.
It's like he was walking around, and you were attacked by a crowd and you were forced to mutate with sticks.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm gonna hit the hood, I'm old, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so have a bite.
And giving passports to assholes like Fred Derst or Monson can only be done by assholes.
I'd rather be ashamed of my job as a better journalist.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described Crimean events as dramatic:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I suppose the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something does not fit into the general picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to the neighbor's place and taking his place...
The War of the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started with the call of some creep from the Kremlin.
I'm guessing who it might have been...
Cobzon's got a lot to live on.
I don't understand why he should lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little country.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise leads the 7th in spite of attempts by the 9th to shed light on the leader's loss on today's show
The exit of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to highlight the implications of the Liberal Party's application to liberate the leader's seat was unable to raise today's ratings.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat, Tony Abbott.
Competition - Sunrise - with leading David Koh and Samantha Armitage - is stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian tellers, while Sunrise had 397,000 viewers in five of the largest cities compared to Today’s audience of 339,000.
Today gained slightly more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the Sunrise gap in recent months.
Today had 318,000 in August, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against Today's 314,000.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015.
An important news for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thompson.
A new drama about a recently widowed family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million.
Critics wondered if Thompson could handle a popular solo show without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a loud yes.
The X Factor of the Seventh remained in strong positions with a audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the 7th, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe’s new television set was collected by 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) has increased to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyra (613,000).
On Monday evening, Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers for the first half hour, and on the second half of the night, it was a total of 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for the Million Dollar Minute that couldn't play the McGuyre show.

The three finalists agree that "The bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snow White Markoskey, may have been given a chance to figure out which one of them will win the Holostjak.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually be left in Holostjak is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And the three girls who reached the finals, of course, keep silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoskey and Lana Jevons-Fellow the day before the three girls were supposed to be left with two, they may have given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's finale.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, referring to his sense of humor, purpose, family values, joy as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should have the last Rose of Wood?" they could have reluctantly pointed out which one of them actually won the heart of the Holostjak.
Jevons Fellows and Marcoskey were no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had good relations since day one.
"Since I joined the participants, I have felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I have realized that they are very good to each other, and throughout the show I have never doubted it," said Javeons Fellowes.
"Sara's a very open man, she's easy and funny," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McKay herself said that because of last week's house visits, she realized that Wood might be the man himself.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To the question of who voodoo should be chosen, if not her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow White and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor shows Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.
Is it originally called "Sara, Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jarrid Hain had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball, which the former Australian league player Reggie allowed at the first return of the pant in a winning 20-3 game with Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to return the pant, and he also engaged him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving the new recruits a ride in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the match.
Special Reporter of the 49ers Cam Inman Club reported that Hain also received support from the team coordinator Thomas McCoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost his sword in the return of the pant by the Minnesota Wykings team during the first quarter.
At the beginning of the NHL debut, Hain and his many Australian worshipers were obviously not counting on it.
It was evident that Haine was scolding when he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the lead shows "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which he could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game and all," said Haine.
Hain compared his debut to his debut in the series of games of Origin in 2007, when the throw of the ball in his credit zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience has proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use at Siberian airport.
President Vladimir Putin was publicly challenged, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were cut off.
There were clashes between migrants and the police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement Reske, which had become a conflict with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used waterworks and tear gas, and Reuters transmits it.
Migrants stoned the police and tried to break the border ban.
Support is being directed to the site of the clashes, police officers are responding to acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to the French-Presse Agency, refugees managed to break through the police border, and dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports the BBC.
The authorities of the country have allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the country they need.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border and the accelerated procedure for processing asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court has already found one migrant guilty of crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border illegally and will therefore not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the border of the country's parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began to build a fence with a barbed wire length of 175 km at the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian confessed to the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
The biggest cyberattack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, Reuters reported.
During the trial at the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed in conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber attacks against 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years in prison, as well as a fine of $1 million.
In sentencing, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce the time limit.
The sentence to Drinkman will be pronounced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitri Smilian, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he has incriminated.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of Bashar Assad.
During a telephone call with the head of the Russian M.I.D., Sergey Lavrov, Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, warned that Russian support for Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict and undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," says a report published on the US Department of State.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
During the telephone call, Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Before long, White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that was conducting an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
The media has recently often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syrian territory.
To this end, the head of the Russian M.I.D., Sergey Lavrov, claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years to help Syrians acquire technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution, the official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some had thrown stones and lighter bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The confrontation was the last of several weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where the Madesi people claimed that the new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as the centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed the new mayor, Oleg Borovski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told the Regional Correspondent.
Oleg Valerevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I took note of the results of financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
A municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document turnover to five days.
In the past, the paperwork could have walked for months.
Income-generating and cost-optimisation activities have been developed.
Last November, a government retreat was held in Saiangsk, where socio-economic development of the Territory was addressed.
There was no project documentation (PSA) for any facility in the city.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the roads, the kindergarten, the northern sewer and the water.
Road work is now under way on two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saiangsk.
This positive demographic has not been seen in the city in 27 years.
Thus, the issue of placement in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
Since 1 September, the capital maintenance of children ' s centres No. 10 has been closed, with 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year a kindergarten No. 23 opened after repair, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repairs were carried out under regional and local co-financing conditions, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half years.
We don't have orders for children from three to seven years old.
Investors show interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must primarily be done by Saiyan enterprises, and that is precisely what needs to be done.
As early as October, 60 apartments for orphans in the Leningrad microregion were being used.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has been included in the programme of housing development of the economy class.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 units will begin shortly.
We have all announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate very much in the programme.
One condition: the housing must be less than 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes the “key” section.
If we deal with the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, the Saiyan Porcine Complex was built on the ground, which was sold for free in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to challenge this deal.
Even more so, the land under the facility is federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launching of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great asset for the city.
In Sayansk, has the Social Partnership Institute developed?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Businesses such as the East Centre ZAO, the New Ziminski TEC, the Saiyan Broiler OOO, the MDF PCO, the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the City of Sojansk Broiler gave the city a children's town, the East Centre company repaired a horseyard where specialists were working with children in a state of therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Sponsorship funds have helped to improve the area of the city of Zagsa.
The sponsors helped to mark the city’s Day beautifully.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
It was released in the summer of the city, the book of the Saiyan poets.
Jewelry medals have been given to first-timers and people who have made a major contribution to the development of Saiyanska.
Mercenaries also participate in the work of the City Charity Fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 rubles are designed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are social human resources problems addressed in Sayanska?
The city lacks doctors and teachers.
The provision of housing services is essential to address the staffing issue.
During the past year, we gave five apartments to doctors, and four teachers were provided with the accommodations.
We have a housing programme in place with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
The plans are a redesign of the building, where eight more apartments will be built for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the Russian Family Housing programme.
In the future, building a house for budget staff.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of social benefits, taking into account price increases.
A bill was introduced in Gosdou to index social pensions annually as of 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the paper, Mr. Alexander Lomakin-Romanci, a member of the “Just Russia”, also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April if the rate of increase in subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The indexation of pensions, according to existing legislation, has been carried out annually since 1 April, taking into account the growth of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the FF over the past year.
The draft law, which was introduced in the lower chamber, provided for the introduction of social pension indexation, taking into account the growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second is carried out on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated that it was unacceptable for Mogherini to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, the Speaker of the OSCE, Ilkka Kanerwa, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the Assembly were unacceptable.
Journalists were informed by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected in support of Canerva ' s position.
"There has already been enough strong support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect signatures of deputies indicating that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, Kanerwa had promised to raise the problem to the European Union's governing structures and to "send a petition".
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone to the south of the Green Mouse is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low pressure area in approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape islands is likely to turn 60 per cent into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the National Centre of Hurricanes of the United States reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined area of low pressure between the Green Mouse and the Small Antilles is also 60 per cent likely to form tropical cyclone in the next two days, synoptics from Miami report.
Google launches a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help incendiary European countries to refugees fleeing war-torn and destitute countries.
Google has taken an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a campaign to collect donations in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, a member of Google Rita Masood, who had fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We were on questionable trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has increased, many people like my family desperately need help.
Contributions will be made to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: “Doctors without Borders”, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on Google.com/refugeelief reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, with more than 4 million displaced this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with minor obesity may benefit from obesity surgery
A favourable effect after surgery of obesity in people with minor obesity suffering from type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with minor obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“Death statistics are not immediate,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) of 35 or higher.
IMT, weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above suggests that a person is overweight and that people with IMTs above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Hospital of Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and hand gastrectomy, with the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with minor obesity.
The mean value of IMTs for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those receiving non-surgical treatment with diabetes remain at approximately 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially cured.
In the treatment group, only 1% had complete treatment for diabetes, and only about 2% had only partial treatment for diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” cholesterol LPNPs “were generally better in a surgical group”, the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled the levels of A1s in blood that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Haemoglobin A1c should be kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycaemic controls, reflected by the good levels of A1c hemoglobin, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the research manager, Dr. Chi-Chang Su and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the group receiving the hand gastrictoma, the kicking group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), greater reduction in IMT (by 7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and was closer to total remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does indeed lead to an increase in life expectancy, reports Blackstone of the College of Medicine at Phoenix, Arizona University.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose barrier interventions, the probability of dying over 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with IMTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, since it states that such surgery is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient’s IMT reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse.
In Mysteries, robbers took furrows and 9 million rubles out of the house.
In Mysteries, robbers attacked the inhabitants of the masonry house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
There was an incident Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns entered a house on Goryko Street through an open front door, tied a 20-year-old son to the house and, threatening both with a knife, abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading “Breakdown”.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the world football championship in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not in a hurry to obtain a permit.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
In the lead-up to the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the city’s guests.
Rosbalta interlocutors believe that because of the tournament the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30 per cent, and after the divestment championship, the cost of renting apartments will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup of Football made the authorities pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written in the first place, each hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that not everyone can do so: the hotelers are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antitrust Service in Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to institute 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to anti-monoperators.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that at present, literally every number in the account, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that all Petersburg hotels will be occupied during the football championship.
Tourists can now count on 30,000 in the city.
According to Smolny, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 single-star hotels, are in Petersburg.
According to Nana Gwichi's First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified, with so many accredited companies in Petersburg.
This is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, which are not known to the Smalny on the easing of circumstances.
I mean, there could be more classifications than that, but no one knows.
“The last six months of the hotel did not seek very much to be classified,” acknowledged the Director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union of Tourism, Ekaterina Shadska.
This is due to the high season during which hotel staff earn the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets in which no verification costs were incurred, while the procedure may cost hotels depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 rubles and more.
But recently, hotel managers have stepped up and applied for classification, Shadsky assured.
Hotels need to be able to make it by 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but they will not have the right to work in the world championship.
It is already known that according to stardom, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed during the tournament.
The formulas by which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not allow the promotion to take place twice or three times, but the hotels need to be made.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” explained the President of the Russian Guest Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is done within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better to travel without restraint," he said.
It's not clear what happens to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State have introduced a bill that prohibits hostels in residential homes.
I very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved," says Nana Guchia.
However, she said that the owners of mini-hotels should in any case be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the Gosduma approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the hostels in Petersburg, and at present there are 1.5 thousand.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of North-West Leonid Garbar, there are two and three-star hotels in Petersburg that are needed by football patients, but there is a crossroads towards four-star hotels and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to that of “75,000 VIPs in the 80,000 stadium”.
It can be fixed at the expense of the mini-hotels.
Their possible prohibition is considered "idiotism": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments and this is why they can't come."
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, I agree that this is wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hospitals are risking missing the world football championship and because of their in haste.
Hundreds of small hotels simply cannot get through the classification, and they are digging for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will give up less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose which ones to travel,” noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the checks carried out so far are much higher than the ones in Petersburg.
The reason for the Petersburg delay is due to permanent changes in the government's tourist bloc, which does not contribute to a coherent work.
In the view of experts, if the Petersburg hotels are not enough, there is likely to be a need to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized into the city, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in their quarters.
In addition, many sufferers will be prepared to come to the trailers where they can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they'll let go," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also popular during the soccer championship will be the change of dwelling.
It is likely that the city will create a reserve of rented apartments.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30 per cent.
“From the obvious, the first will be the accommodation near the stadium”, noted a resident of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research of Larissa Bragin.
While the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport solutions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only hint at the road, but can also conduct a mini tour.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children in the yard in 1970.
They found it difficult to sleep with hotels at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our apartment to sleep," said the interviewer.
True, he added that there were no such traits left in the city - calling home with consequences and fear.
But in 2018, after the failure of the Lord, would the mistake of the hotel and the government have to remember the former?
Gyrinovsky “sal” Amur district.
I was delighted to see the clown Girinowski in Gosduma today.
He did things like this when our generation was learning to trade newspapers, and it's still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the speech is “the LDPR 's protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols do not shake, for there is nothing; there are no protocols other than those signed by the election, according to the LDDR.
Behold, he raises up Ivan Abramov, the second, and cries out, "This is the winner of the election."
And then, after the fire with the chairman, he pulls the faction out of the conference room, shouting, "You're all with the fronts of your rogues and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of factions as a result of this scandal and insult.
The real Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly poured the Amura region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is Gyrinski's next exit in the style of "Podonka!", not a protest by the political party against the results of the specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the election, if you trust the party's website and the Facebook site of Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously coming down.
He provides the dead on Amura with his own protection of his dead, and he himself preaches against the One Russia in general and should not be a relative in anything.
It's an excellent decision not to lose a person, not to go into a real scandal.
Another thing is that Abraham himself is in a strange situation.
Except for the boss, he didn't expect anything, there's no alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but in the narrow circle that it has become a formal occasion for the insult of the esteemed champion, and, on the other hand, of Ham's attacks to the ER and UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandatory district, it can become a steam that has successfully benefited from its own party leadership and super-irritor for the same ONF and party leadership of a foreigner.
Indeed, there would be no Girinowski, and he should be invented and observed with respect.
The trade will grow and grow before it.
There was news that the LDDR would return to the hall during the next one.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nowhere.
Only Abram's theme was buried.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Empathy Centre in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances the interests of humanity must be greater than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for its actions in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you must also think about long-term solutions to how to bring true peace and present development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries.” He stressed.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following terrorist attacks on 9/11, claiming that the United States' strong reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand disinfectant in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported a nearly 400 per cent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a high-spirited disinfectant, according to the Georgian toxicology centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord López, director of the Georgia Toxicology Centre, children's ingestion of up to 12 years of hand disinfection fluids reported at toxicology centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more in contact with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the emergency room,” said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant specifically, and some do it to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show adolescents drinking disinfectant as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed the disinfectant with an alcohol - containing fluid to tickle their mouth to obtain a stronger drink.
Children of younger age may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," López said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizing liquids) are those that are fragrant.
There are disinfectant fluids for hands with the smell of tubers, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The disinfectant for the hands contains about 45 to 95 percent of the alcohol.
Young children, in particular, may be exposed to alcohol poisoning.
"This is high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief physician at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a robe out of the whiskey, but people look at these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant for her hands with a tubular scent of about four sprays at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be in a state of alcohol abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naijah confused her words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night at a separate children’s clinic to avoid any signs of brain trauma, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Naji.
This could well have been fatal for my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-spirt substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for the hands of children from the reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three four-graders in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposable” teacher by “deployment of antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to a police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she had forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe that the failed plan was “empty conversations” and address discipline to the school district.
How the oldest children’s library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the rock at the entrance to the N.K. Krupsky children's library, the iron owl is saddened.
The little ones who come for the books try to feed her confetti.
For several generations, it has been in the library for 95 years.
The earliest readers of the twentieth century made loud noises, staged plays on Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary quizzes, and copied them with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalinec wrote in 1939, “the friendship between Hope of Constantinople Krump and friends of the Barnaul children's library” was growing stronger every day.
Nadia Constantinovna even sent her children’s picture to her distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadia Constantinovn objected to having her name assigned to the library, she said no, she did not object.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandkids of the first readers have to explain whose raw profile is adorned by the barrel on the library building.
During the years of restructuring, various people often called, saying: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of a good child writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and popular library in Barnaul as a Lenka in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick road.
"The Magician of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Formerly, Olya was a law firm manager, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all the other managers, she was just a love of drawing.
And then she went online and said, "I need an illustrator for the book."
A little American girl wrote the book, and it was called My Cancer Mommy, "My mom's having cancer."
Olya was doing illustrations, and she thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in her if you didn't create them yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates the children’s books of writers around the world, and makes up her own stories.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have reading children, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says the director of the Tatyana Kushweed Library of Russia.
In recent years, we've even had this moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby there is a large exhibition window with an updated photoexposure.
New photos of readers who visit the entire family library are posted in the neighborhood: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library rejoices that the popes began to come with the children.
When a child is two years old, he needs books that are more complicated.
But there is now a law under which an eight-year-old Wonderkind is prohibited from publishing books in category 12+.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents with him -- they come back, then they come back, and gradually Kruppsky becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolution collection of abbeys and eras, to take the Queen in the annex to the magazine "Niva", a 1936 Marquis.
After all, we are not just the conceptual space of the book temple, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school," explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come together to read, play, draw.
We've made a game zone for the little ones - the kid comes just to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they resist with their feet, and they do not want to leave.
Moms often come with wheels, and we're glad that they put the library first among all the other places to come with the little ones.
Tatyana Kushvid says: Modern children, just like we used to, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing work is now under way, and a lot of attention is given to authors who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to young children, it's important to them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes tracts for parents, telling them what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books should be considered, and why.
The bouquets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but it's not really for them.
It is forbidden to take books outside the adult reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...in the furthest room of the library is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will be creaking under your feet -- it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend.
Ally's still walking along the road with a yellow brick, Tol Ryzhikov's tape is stealing magic matches, and Malchish Kibaltsch has never told the goddamn bourgeois of the War Secret -- that's a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can learn your own from them anywhere.
There's a real bookstore, like a pre-revolutionary collection of abjects and epochs.
Or take the Queen to a famous app for the magazine "Niva".
Or a 1936 ice cream patch.
The time has grown old, the pages have been decorated with tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I dream of going to retirement and doing rare children's books.
But the kids won't be able to do that anymore: and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pionary Truth"?
But it was still interesting, says Galina Ilasov, who heads the bookstore.
It's been dark since time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running a bookstore her entire life.
She knows the color of the pins of Buratino, when Harry Potter became captain of the Griffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, where Carlson uses the silencer for the motorbike, and who Alice Selezneva's father works.
Little is paid for a librarian’s work, and anyone who can live without these book rows is quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: Enlighteners, educators, and ministers of the book’s cult.
They're also known by smiles - it's thought to be a professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books at all: how a librarian I like to have them standing in the regiments straight and beautifully, and I still love reading them,' says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fiction.
I'm reading contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them foolishly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone's sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the hills.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children, even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: The Celtics have no differences
Griffiths contradicted the discussions about the seltics after Dale's confession that Hups is in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that may violate the unity of the team.
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Seltic" to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-time penultimate gave Aberdeen a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Don's to get away from Celtic for five points.
Griffiths refuted the discussion of differences
This has led to rumours of differences in the Celtics, which have been cut off by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates are not suffering from any intense criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are after him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't fighting for the title - de Bur
A former wingman from Rangers and former member of the Dutch national team, Ronald de Bur, said that Dutch football patients lost interest in Celtic because he did not compete for the title with Rangers.
De Bur, currently the representative of Ajaxa, said: "In Holland, the most attractive moments of the Celtic Games no longer show, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Company games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was having a hard time, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
The defeat of Malmo and, as a result, the exit of the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen footballers, who now score five points, taking the top line of the table.
But Dale said, "Velite's had bad times before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of the Celtics, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warberton is looking forward to January transfers with no confidence
Despite opinions that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, Mark Warberton, the "Ringers" chief, was suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former attacker Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in Celtic, hinted that his career was over.
The attack on Swancie Mitch, linked to Seltic during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave the football after his contract with the Swans had ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is about to confront the SFA with regard to Nelson's claims.
"Harts" accounted for 2:1, when Patterson was removed, and they lost 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later cancelled; it was the third red card of the Colum, which was cancelled in eight months.
Nailson doesn't give up on his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tyncasl
The stubborn player of the Habernian team got an excuse after admitting to singing a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Scatzel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tainasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to Tyncasl if he didn't play for Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis's board is confident in Dundee United's management.
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dundee United remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to go out again," Donnelly said.
Maxines is glad to see that "indescribable" won the Hamiltons.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league championship, which placed them five points higher than the Celtics, on the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time toolbar.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything -- a cup or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among Scottish people is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was above the United Kingdom level of 5.5 per cent, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with a current employment rate of 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has decreased by a quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average figure of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
In commenting on the latest figures, the Minister for Scotland, David Mandelle, noted: “The Government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market of Scotland in the growth of employment and the reduction of unemployment.
Why am I witnessing the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the death row in Oklahoma State prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed story of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who wish often more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press outlets was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship after several months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story how he likes it, he gets access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could better formulate” herself, but still believes that I am wrong about what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I won't go into detail here again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossip isn't to blame.
His actions after Barry van Treez's murder make him guilty of abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that evidence for the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to look to.
From me, you'll know what it's like to watch a man I like die without having to.
A man being chased by the police was persuaded to leave the Canning River
A constable from Canning-Vale managed to convince a man to come out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police, but failed to get caught in dirty water on a small boat a few feet from a police officer trying to "coax him out ashore".
The Canning Vail police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself at Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sgt. Chanel Castledyne.
Constable Laclain Perjavec didn't really want to pee on the uniform, so he used a safer reception -- "negotiations with a good police officer".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Castledale.
That's exactly what the Ben Casinos football player remembered.
In 2006, Kazinz moved to the cabin to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but the locals were encouraged to invent a joking Ben Cassins Biatlon.
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the flight attendants of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by the flight attendants and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, who he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the launch due to a violation of the rules on the day of the start, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Mudi informed Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to take part in the jumps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lidari sample on the cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept his mouth shut about the suspicions of espionage for over a year and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've endured for a long time, but sometimes it beats you so hard that you don't hold back anymore," Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know - I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think they're wrong, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody made a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if they asked, and offered him a job in my stable to share information about what I was doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all make statements because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rawlston, former RVL President, David Moody, current RVL President, and Bernard Sondry, the current RVL Executive Director, knew all along and knew now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to answer for what's going on in this business, other people than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it saddens me.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and put them under responsibility for decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's boredom only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and the leader, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say that he could "screw his license to the table".
Moody, most famous for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "stupid" after the foot of the horse was compressed from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must be fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake with a compression on her leg.
She could've got a compression last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the compression contest, for which the flight attendants opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Moody.
The driver, who made the raid and disappeared from the scene in Cobra, was arrested
Police arrested a man who crashed a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekends and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is anticipated that he will be charged with leaving the scene, without assistance and with violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobra, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, has been suing rivals for the use of forceful force.
Coach "Melburn Storm" Craig Bellamy called the ball grabbing criticism by his team as "imposing an agenda" by two NRL champions.
Coach Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson said that the judges had allowed Storm to fight his team during a sudden Storm victory in the Sydney qualifying finals on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbein Broncos" Wayne Bennet made a clear point on Storm after his team won the finals of the qualifying tournament at Nosern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called this game "typical" for the League of Regby and said that two of Queensland's teams weren't "too successful" in a handball fight.
Bellamy defended the ball's grip with his team and said that they were just focused on contact, grabbing the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident of the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, since this meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It's still coming up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about hard receptions when they played us with the score 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything for a year in our security systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks we have given special attention to contact in the interception of the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's kind of a shock to him.
It's funny, as it always is this time of year.
Bellamy disputed Bennett's idea of an impressive football game, reminding his teacher that St. George-Ilavarra Dregons won the 2010 championship, showing boring football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy noted.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young paralegals at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-men like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play it that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and Roosters were competing with more points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Bronco game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is it impressive football?
Or do you think that breaks and failed attempts are impressive?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
The Storm at the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronella Sharks on the following Saturday night at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be sold on the following Tuesday morning.
Serbian drug-supply defendant bailed out for $200,000
A man who is threatened with life imprisonment for trying to absorb 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling was released on bail at $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after the Federal Police discovered 100 kilos of drugs on the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumera in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Despite Maximovic's risk of life expectancy for trying to allocate narcotic drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, Maximovic's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to win the whole party and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been bailed out.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather were asked to make a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the amount of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But one measure was not sufficient to guarantee that it would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, will be observed daily by the police and will observe the curfew from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katzicaris: "I am proud of the assembled Greece, which fought until the last seconds."
Greece's main coach, Fotis Katzicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the Eurobasket-2015 final with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game was solved by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quote AFP Katzikaris.
We were preparing for an excellent game in the performance of the Spanish.
They tried to work in defense, but the defense's faults determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned to the CSC."
Novice CSKA Joel Fried said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer, and, by myself, after I joined the team, he quotes Friland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to re-establish the central position, but I played the fort more at the NBA.
Now it's going to have to be harder to confront the big center of the rival, but I've done it before, so I think I can handle it now.
The Armenians last won the Euroliga in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to Final Four six times, but they couldn't show each other their best basketball.
There's a feeling someone's been sweeping the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its sick people.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning Euroliga, I really think.
I always wanted to win that title, the Moscows had already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSC.
As for the eyeglass, I'm not a superstitious man, and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "To me, the game with Roma will be special."
The head coach of the Barcelonas, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the group tournament of the League of Champions with the Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the eye match of his current and former team will be far from line.
It will be recalled that Luis Enrique trained “wolfs” in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show off on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later for which I had gained some experience.
I have very fond memories of Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions with a victory.
The August meeting in Cuba, Joan Hamper, will not affect the action of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the Roma game she showed in the A-series against the Yventus.
It's a strong team that can pressing and know what to do with a ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: "The Krasnodar" has different options for attacking."
Acting chief coach, Ural, Vadim Scripchenko, in the lead of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar noted the diversity of attack patterns of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of the attack in their arsenal.
The match will take place on 21 September and will begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
As we play with the Krasnodar, let's see, the official Urala website introduces the words Scripchenko.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options of attack, it carries out its attacks in a variety of ways, but we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the foreground of this game, given that the Krasnodar is holding a League of Europe match against Dortmund “Borussia”, we will try very well to prepare to win.
Roger Kanyas: Astana's house can pick up points from anyone.
Astana's wingman, Roger Kanyas, after the match of the 1st team tournament of the League of Champions with "Benfia" (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In Habbek’s view, the Astanas are able to pick up points from any rival.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can tell you that we played well, the UEFA official website of Kanyas says.
Benfika's in the upper class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick up their glasses.
It's real.
But first you have to think about Galatasare and then you have to think about Athletics.
In the home games, we can pick out points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "Once again, Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
The main coach, Rafael Benitez, expressed his satisfaction with the major victory in the 1st round of the League of Champions' Group Tournament with the Chesster (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the front of Christian Ronald, who was the author of the three heads.
The match was not easy, because Schachter knows how to wield the ball, he's running the official UEFA website of the words of Benitez.
The rival didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I can't say that Real has played perfectly, but we've had enough opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and beat four.
Christian Ronald has confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll do it again as many times as I can.
Jordy Alba: "Christian Ronald cannot be compared to Massey."
Barcelona's protector, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare with his partner, Lionel Massey.
According to the Spanish, the "Real" Ford to Christian Ronald can't do that either.
Massey, five heads above the others, quotes Le Figaro Alba.
Even Christian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright personality.
The Roma sidekick Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in playing with such a strong rival.

Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to seek images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone gone missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked him out and found shocking photos, and immediately she called her mother’s attention.
The police came and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at that address and found "appropriate" requests in the search system using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend he was a police officer to scare them".
Commissioner-in-Charge Eilid Robertson informed the Danish sheriff's court: "He said it was a passion, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to intimidate the pedophiles.
He was asked about a conversation with an unknown person who had sent him pictures and what he had asked for more photographs.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, she trembled and wept.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then an eye rate was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used the computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of producing obscene photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing before the court on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to list Hogga for sexual offences, as it could be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, pending receipt of social services reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained prior to hearings in other remaining cases.
It was placed on the list of persons who committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest government leader of Africa, fell earlier this year from a staircase leading from the podium.
He didn't get hurt, but the video with the falling scene just spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against Mugabe's exposure during the appeal.
A month ago, they whistled at the President during his appeal to the nation in parliament; that is exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled “Death”, he told reporters after Mugabe had finished his speech.
It warned the members of parliament that the integrity of the Parliament was ending in the building, and as soon as they came out, parliamentary integrity was not in effect.
A member of parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “settled” by its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard envisages reducing between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and reduction programme for services.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating computer and printer production from faster developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in employment would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, according to Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients worldwide.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual profit of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing previously unavailable complex technological solutions” to companies, according to a statement by the company.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hüllett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the birthplace of the Silicon Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, a recent development in this sector, based on the belief that narrow-based companies are working better.
"Arsenala" Michael Arteta says his teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing "Dinamo Zagreb"
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that provided Wilshire's recovery was on schedule, he would not be prevented from returning to the game until Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will accurately miss at least four of the next games in England and, in view of what has happened, his participation in the European Championship will remain at stake next summer.
The most insulting thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire has confidently completed the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bones.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries that happened to him before.
This may be medically related, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Prime Minister Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries in six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 games "Arsenala" in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for the Arsenal wider, you can see that in the six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs of the Premier League, which accounted for the most missed due to the trauma of the day.
Hungarians recognize the likelihood of a fallout in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, after the injury, you are vulnerable for some time -- you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure he will, as well as that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign in the League of Champions Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mother Debussy and Artet will play in the starting line.
Perhaps Wenger will also join Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Gira instead of Nacho Morale and Theo Walcott.
"I am trying to maintain balance and give a little respite to the players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is the absolute favorite in Group F, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most embarrassing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they had last season as the Unbeatable.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-point earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that the Arsenal has learned the lesson of the last season when the team was defeated in the Monaco Champions League, and remains with poor hope of bringing the club to the finals of the Cup of Champions.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is in sight, especially given the desperate need of men to be honest now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its peak in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of the Campaign against Unhappily Life, 2015 declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
A friend is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a sufficient number of friends “in a normal mood”, the chances of being treated doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chance of mental disorders.
But of course, friendship should work, especially if it is to be.
In the age of social networking, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often worth more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, cheerful, and successful, even if loneliness actually prevails.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entire values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noticed, you're not going to buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of the Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each character was determined not by his own work, but rather by the personality he showed in association with his friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's constant arms, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighing on Rachel -- it all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully examining their feelings.
As Officer Samaritans said to me: "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, underlines how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often the men who approach us feel unable to speak to their friends.
The old "live with this" teaching is as strong as the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the notable moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a foreigner on the phone helps people at times of despair, and long-term support comes from the immediate family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday you fully restored the decorations, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or better yet, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
It is not possible to guess in advance the benefits of friendship.
The series Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by #FriendsFest
D'Maria scores by helping the PIC break Malmo.
Angel de Maria, like Blaze Matthews and Edinson Cavanaugh, celebrates the swords that were shot at the Malmö Gate.
Angel de Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, allowing the "PJ" to pass "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edison Cavanaugh did their job when Parry Saint-Jerman started his game in the Champions League with a very comfortable win of 2:0 against Malmo on Tuesday at Park de Prince Stadium.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions was launched as a player of the "FGM" to direct the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavanaugh scored a goal for 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Schachter in Group A, Parry had to make a good start against the Swedish champions, because they were focused not on the performance of the playoffs, but on the continuation of the series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blahn to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later replace him in the field against the team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests in the Champions League, so winning the score of 2:0, delivering the rivals with problems and playing the defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we will need to work out during the season," said Blan.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't hit on one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with a score of 2:2 in a match with Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but took him to the back of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
The Argentine invader was noted as a player capable of bringing the PIC to a new level in Europe after he was bought at Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he fled from Marco Verratti behind the Malmö defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to a distant corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected an easy and great victory from the FGM then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated the Celtics in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five advocates, and two resilient midfielders, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nikola Jurdzic's strike, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's 34th minute gate, they attacked very little.
However, the FGM sometimes failed itself with ineffectual transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who only in the first half failed to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to handle the ball that was killed by Kavani immediately after the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved to be much more skilled in the exact lanes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Di Maria, sent the ball with a round-the-clock blow, which passed the banister past Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's notice thanks to Kavanaugh, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic had fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the capture of Willand's ball from a short distance did not allow David Lewis to increase the final score before Esquiel Lavessi was replaced by the goal at the end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class of his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held in December last year."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not sufficient.
Glory to the Money!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion in stock sales.
The Swiss mining and trading giant Glencore, who had suffered from the decline in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its grand debt reduction plan.
The London Stock Exchange quoted Glencore as saying that it had sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off the debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value, is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices while the decline in China ' s economy is exacerbating demand and creating chaos in world markets.
Thanks to the release of new concessional shares, the Glencore stock exchange took off at the early morning auctions on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 FTSE 100, which was trading 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencore launched a $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of extensive plans to reduce its 30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares of 125 cents per item, i.e. with a discount of 2.4 per cent at the closing price on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's statutory capital.
Fear of continued decline in the Chinese economy has reduced the cost of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have dropped by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms C.J.'s visit to Washington
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official report that the head of China, Si Jinpin, would arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit to CY Qinpina in Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's arrival in Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also receive Si Jinpina and his wife, Pen Liyuan, at a government lunch on the evening of the same day after two leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Si Jinping will enable cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the Presidents of the United States and China to approach the contentious topics constructively,” the communication said.
Si Jinpin, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading US technology companies on their way to Washington and then to New York for participation in the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Si Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington ' s concerns about China ' s alleged cyberspying and China ' s growing categorization of the disputed South China Sea area.
The biker hit the Kutuzov fever received 2 years of colony.
In addition, the Court partially granted the civilian claims of 1.2 million roubles to Dani Mirzoev.
The Dorogomilov court of Moscow sentenced Dani Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov prospectus in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in prison in the colony.
It is found guilty under the heading “Contravention of traffic regulations and the operation of vehicles” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the Court partially granted the civilian claims of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that eight million rubles be recovered from the victims.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at about three o'clock at night in the area of House 30 on the Kutuzov prospectus.
The BMW, behind which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the front lane and hit a motorcycle driver on the side.
In 1989, a man died on the spot from injuries.
Friends of the deceased in social media reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at a high speed and was on his way to the front of the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Vorobje Mountains to the Moscow GUMVD building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it was known that the investigation of the alleged perpetrator of the accident had been delayed.
A naked man was detained in Moscow.
He acted calmly and did not commit any unlawful acts, and the police handed him over to the doctors for urgent psychiatric care.
The officers of the capital police detained a Moscow resident who entered one of the temples without clothing.
That's what Moscow is reporting.
According to the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, around 4 p.m. on the Kashir highway.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He acted calmly and did not commit any unlawful acts.
The police have arrived at the scene of the call.
Law enforcement was waiting for doctors from the emergency psychiatric unit and handed them over to the man.
They were 26-year-olds living in Moscow.
Over 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakusev.
Over 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen province of Vladimir Yakusev at a meeting of the Bureau of the regional Government.
Some of them dealt with the allocation of funds to educational and medical institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds are being allocated for the acquisition of a bus for a school in the Lower Town District, for the major repair of the district hospital in the Kazan region.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
Hot and cold water, water, electricity and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, building facades, facilities, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be repaired.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of the Tunisian delegation headed by the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the Honourable Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena, Vladimir Sugle, who was a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the sociable forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions -- important links between the two States.
It is planned that President Vladimir Putin and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus will participate in the plenary meeting.
In plenary and section meetings, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, regulatory arrangements and programmes of the Federal State will be discussed.
The Governor of Tumen will address the forum.
I believe that this demonstrates successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be open.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new contracts and agreements of benefit.
I would add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including 19 Russian regions.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that there was a meeting of a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus in Tuna.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the area of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of Tumensk Region, Vladimir Yakusev discussed the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they are needed to reduce the cost of cars for the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Dutch House of Commerce, Belshina, and options for the prevention of losses.
The issues were important, as investment projects should work clearly and profit the region.
Further shipments of passenger and cargo equipment by the OAU "MAZ", the development of the OAU "MAZ" service centre, which was established in Tumena on the basis of the OAU "TATP".
The discussion also addressed the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to come to a new level.
The regional centre was also concerned with these issues.
During a meeting with Tumena Mayor Alexander Moore, we talked about the re-establishment of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing" so a new batch of cars from Belarus are needed to work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAU ' s Mogilevliftmash elevator products, receiving complete ones.
In my view, these activities could become more active in view of the programmes for the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
I would add that, within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgansky Region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of the increase in trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment was discussed in Zauralje.
A meeting with the Om Governor is scheduled for late September.
The expanded Consular District includes five members of the Russian Federation, but Tumen may be called the county headquarters.
The region is a hub for many forward-looking projects, including the work of the Honourable General Assembly.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they enable many problems to be addressed directly and quickly by removing them from their focus and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the impact by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon disputed with African-American producer Effie Brown, claiming behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the Sunday edition of Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the script selected for the project.
"Many things are appropriate when you're casting for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The bewitched Brown, not believing her ears, insulted "Oh, my God.
To discuss the finalists, the show joined Damon and Brown with co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to consider what interpretations of the image of Harmony they are going to follow," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets beaten up by a white pimp.
The film producer Dear White People advocated Leo Angelos and Christen Brancaccio as directors; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "in the end we can get what we want."
After the discussion was shown on television, social networks blew up disapprovalal comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angrily about the video: "Explaining the essence of the diversity of Matt Damon to the only black person in such a white room that it hurts."
Tweet's got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's statements appear just when the literate coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colourful population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of candidates for the “Album of the Year” at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question by Fox News staff member Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a group of haters.
"Black Lives Matter is a group of love," the movement leaders said.
It has recently been announced that Damon has been included in the list of show businessmen, producers and media magnates invited to the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he had met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards first champion
Professional scaffolding and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home $1 million.
On this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to get through all the obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Kaldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the task at the appointed time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, who went through the exhausting phase 4, but Kaldiero did the task for three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After a victory with incredible work, Kaldierro, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
“It’s amazing to think that I have never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year,” said Isaac to E! journalists.
And all of a sudden... I never imagined what it was like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wid met with the Hollywood Reporter journalists to discuss the finals and why Britten, the first to pass the route, would not receive any cash prizes.
According to the rules, money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the finished players are more than one, the prize is the fastest," said Wid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a change in life, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended about that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He got tons of excited feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was meant to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
"Child Tigers" quietly goes around Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a distraction, Tigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a score of 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to half-game backtrack Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away from them most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they happen," said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Peter Tigers Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, which led Detroit to score three points in the first two innings, then add one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was just his third high-quality launch in nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers don't get to play every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The designated Taigers reflector, Victor Martinez, was able to take three shots and sustained two wounds -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day of three strikes since four strikes against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the beat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (better quality), much better in his biting work and kept this quality for the game.
Having three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
Byron Buxton, the central host, opened the inning with a doppelganger on the left.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, who made the bant, took first base, and second beissman Brian Dozer got a strike-out in a flash from Simon before he was taken over by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moyer, the only player on the road who had previously been appointed to visit Miguel Sano, who knocked out the two-eared single to the left of Drew Verhagen's right-hand man.
In the case of a couple of shooters, not in the car and comparing wound at the second base of Verhagen, it was possible to bring the third beysman Trevor Pluff to the stage.
It was the 27th time for the lead league player in this season when Plumf kicked the ball on the double-play.
After Detroit added an insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a "devil" in space between the outfields against the closing pitcher "Tigers" by Bruce Rondon, and the account became 5-4.
However, the right-handed player kicked Sano out after three strikes and got his fifth séve.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unexecuted Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injuries to the game itself, missing more than a month due to the inflammation of the explanation.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game develops, I became more comfortable and was able to perform some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first butter arrived at the first base, Hughes left a single for the second baseball player, Ian Kinsler.
Wok took Victor Martinez out on two of J.D.'s Ritefielders, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with the wounded in a successful position.
Nick Castelianos, third base player, followed by a single, brought another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased their account in the second inning by getting a single-car double from the catcher James McCann and a two-way single from the central reflector Anthony Goose, and it became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, who was considered to have thrown a third inning in an unscheduled spot, was replaced by an A.J.A.A.A.
Hughes got three hits on six hits and a four-strike walk.
NOTE: The Tigers' right-hand man, Anibal Sanchez, has fallen out of the players in connection with the stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a shoulder surgery for Sanchez back in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, he is scheduled to leave on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez the pitcher-left Daniel Norris will leave the trauma list and go against Twins.
Norris, who left Tigers four times since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-handed pitcher on 30 July, has one victory and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since 20 August because of the stretching of the hair of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games on Targetfield on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by the right-wing pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov's complaints about the book "Pray to God" was addressed to the Southern Sakhalin Court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal by the representative of President Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the book "Extremist Material" of the book "Pray to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam," Interfax, referring to the President of the Gorsud Alexander Chuhray.
The Court now looks forward to possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chuchray refused to comment on the statements made by some MPs of the State of the Russian Federation on the need to verify the pride of possible cooperation with foreign intelligence and ISIL.
"Pusses themselves comment such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor ' s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natali Perchenko ' s decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal came from the South Sakhalinska Public Prosecutor ' s Office Friday night.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, they believe that they have asked the Court to accept the extremist opinion of the author of the book rather than the teachings of the Koran.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhrai said.
The decision on the recognition of the book as “extremist material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the Extremists were called the quotations from the Qur'an: "We worship thee and ask thee for help," "Do not call upon anyone besides Allah."
Cadyrov called the decision-makers "the devils and the provocateurs".
He called on the deputies of the State to prohibit by law judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I firmly believe that the Lord must pass a law prohibiting judicial decisions directly relating to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that insult migrants and refugees
On Facebook, staff members intend to delete posts and comments that give negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users of illegal content.
The management of Facebook is intended to combat xenophobia and racism in cooperation with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, prior to the establishment of the special group of moderators, the head of the agency, Hyko Maas, stated that the miniuste was currently working with social experts to establish a special group of moderators.
Its participants have an obligation to monitor and remove inappropriate comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Hyko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their removal.
Organizations whose experts are involved in collecting complaints of insulting posts received from users should also facilitate the timely blocking of the illegal content.
The Facebook Manual intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, through the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after the German section on Facebook had dramatically increased its xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious causes for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had affected the European Union countries a while ago.
In Germany, for example, there is already an overcrowding of all the items intended to accommodate refugees.
On the eve of the day, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced settlers from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were detained under the Nazi regime.
There will be areas for relaxation at Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several cemeteries are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be Butowski, Domodedowski, and Scherbina Cemetery.
The first psychological rest zone has already appeared at the Triecurus Cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will then appear in other parts of the city.
The portal m24.ru was described by Artem Ekimov, head of the State Budget Agency, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that in such “coals” cemetery visitors will be able to rest, stay alone and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, the relaxation zones will be built in Domodedowski, Butowski and Scherbina cemeteries, and then in other parts of the capital.
According to chapter HBU, Ritual, if there is a need to expand the cemetery area, the builders will try to maintain the existing forest masses as much as possible.
Green plantings will serve as a living ban that will divide the areas of rest and space placed directly below the burial sites.
The Ritual HBU experts also stated their intention to propose the abandonment of the burial site.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrierless.
In addition, the Ritual HBU described the willingness to install electronic terminals to enable visitors to the cemetery to learn GPS coordinates and registration marks.
In June this year, the Ritual HBU also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of the year.
So, the grave dig in summer time will stand for a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter when the earth freezes.
Let us note that in the last year, prices for all types of ritual services have travelled by an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a missing mushroom was found in the forest of Elin.
The elderly man was alive, even though he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a commission.
The discovery of the Mushroom was achieved through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from Tambov County spent five days in the woods."
No food, no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even kinologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was discovered after a helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up opatriates and podbrezovniks, but he did not return by evening.
The relatives immediately sought help, and on the very next day, rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised to search for a mushroom — only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a fire rescue centre helicopter joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensky District Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was drawn, the man was found."
He's gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's gone a long way at his age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
Mushroom was taken to Elin’s central district hospital unconsciously, in a very difficult condition.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and cooling.
As an older man was able to stay alive after five days in the woods, doctors are not aware.
Valentina Nepsch, head of the therapy department of the Elinian CEB: "A patient's examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Retired Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolenščina every year from Tambov region.
His grandson says Grandpa had gone to pick mushrooms before, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, said, "The forest is not far from the road, in principle not local."
He literally came to visit for a few years, to visit his relatives.
Well, go get the mushrooms.
Apparently, he's gone a long way and gone awry.
At the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
Five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind us that we need to walk in the woods in bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to keep track of ourselves so that we can return.
Emergency An-2 sat on average in a brotherly taiga.
Right on average, the village in Siberia is an emergency An-2.
An emergency landing was carried out by Enisey, a plane of the Red Air Force, 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage on the ground.
Anne-2 was on a business flight.
There were three crew members on board - commander, second pilot and onboard mechanics, reports Interfax.
An emergency aircraft flew on the route of Železgorsk-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been taken to Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the crash landing of An-2, has initiated a verification of compliance with flight safety legislation.
An investigation team of the Eastern Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, Tu-154 boarded its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction on an abandoned tadé airport in Komi.
Engines and electronics were turned down on the liner, but the crew made it impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured during the emergency landing.
News Economics : Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the developing economies is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to remedy this, there is a need to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to chief scientist of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Solutions of the NIWW, Nobel Prize winner for the 2007 economy, Eric Maskin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization advocated great benefits for developing economies.
“And these projections have come true in many ways,” Maskin stresses.
China and India, for example, have experienced serious per capita GDP growth.
However, not everything is so joyful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “rich” and the “poor” in poor countries, which was reflected in large income inequalities and, more precisely, in wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequalities in developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by WEW.
Together with the economist, Harvard University Professor Michael Kremer Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, reminds USER.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To show them, Maskin provides four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, professionals from poor countries lacked skills to cooperate with professionals A and B from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have a wage increase due to cooperation with B-persons from the rich, D-level workers do not feel their salaries or fall at all.
The result is that internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskinim offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardon theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskarov, the chancellor of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, the head of the Department of Mathematics of NEUWS.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
Addressing the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is improving the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, but companies do not have the advantage of paying for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role in this situation, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produced its fruits in the form of the growth of countries ' GDP.
Derbent: a living connection of time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, marks its 2000s in September.
In the festival programme, the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the past-time fair, the exhibition of the derbent carpets and the Open Temple Day, the historic and musical show "2000 in two hours" and the tours of the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow alleys and the palace gardens - all of this came off the pages of "Thousands and One Night".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazar Khanate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plateaus, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma mosque, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian programme “Derives — Monuments of Living Nature”.
The shade of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The visitor will be served with aromatic tea and will be served with Dagestan treats, such as honey engineer, hurma, muslim, miracle glues, Iran and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large shoals have been used to drink tea to many guests.
The sign on the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 years of hijra.
I mean, 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is struck by the size and solemnity of the arches of domes and vaults, which are based on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and divorce of pigeons is the traditional involvement of the people of Derbent.
Homeowners put bluebirds in backyards, under trees, on fronts.
It's a fascinating sight to fly into the sky a room of white pigeons, like the flashes of a holiday fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gates with a double stone wall.
After going 500 meters at sea, the facility closed down Derbent’s harbor.
In 2003, Derbent's fortresses were included in UNESCO's World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of ancient Persidian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were still weaving in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained virtually unchanged.
On a nearby street market, carpets are sold on any flavor, including fur, cotton, or embroidery of all colors and shades, with or without a vorsa, with a complex ornament and a lovely chammome.
The construction of the city began with a mazalova - blocks with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the maggots have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air - conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval city but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of a water pipeline built by the Persians were preserved about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources have come, where locals still gather water.
Many derbents prefer plain tap water from proven historical fountains.
Derbent was one of the centers of the potter’s trade.
Flood and billet vases, dishes, kitchens, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The potter's hands are still producing amazing ceramics, both practical and souvenir.
During the holidays and festivals, crowds of viewers gather under a tight rope at which the students of the Republican School of Circumstances speak.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship spans several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly visible among canoeers.
There's a museum called "Culture and the Home of the Ancient Derbent" in the former Virgin's Bani room today.
Previously, single girls and brides were washed here accompanied by friends, and now any one who wanted to see a pool room, hot and cold swimming pools that had gone to the past.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and steamers are as popular as they used to be.
The benefits of heating the body are described in the old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, and the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The Commonwealth festival, which takes place in Narin Kala Fortress, is attended by the ethno courtyards of many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform the songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and host visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who have put their heads behind Islam.
This is one of the most respected complexes for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowish sarcophagus have been cut out of the entire stone blocks and are, as the Arabs say, on the west-east axis.
The Gavril brothers and Albert Yakoubovy are stripping and loading customers in a small salon near the Upper Market.
Parikmacher has been there for many years.
Circumstances are passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Jakoub brothers can make not only the traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, there was a house where a decabrist writer named Alexander Bestuzev-Marlinsky lived in the Caucasus.
After learning the Turkish language and collecting the ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third century with his ancient monuments, the life, and the home of the citizens.
Chaihana is the traditional East Club, where only tea and home cooking are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, to communicate with friends, and to solve some work problems.
As in past times, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of chaihan.
The Derbent Caspiy dance ensemble was established three years ago, but has already been able to participate in the Republican and Russian-level events.
The band’s soloists rehearse each day, studying the perfect folk disaster, the Dharginian, the Tatian, the Armenian dances.
On the eve of the evening when the noise and the street lights are on fire, local residents are stationed on benches near houses with standing terraces.
Derbents usually discuss domestic issues.
But in front of the Jubilee, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the entire Black Sea Caspian region.
Domodedov had a business game at the airport.
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students tried to serve as airport staff.
To this end, three aircraft were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers but also served aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not given way to reality.
The delayed flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, were lost somewhere along the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one who was justified in Domodedova's hangar, the standard set of tasks to be addressed to the newcomers.
Three large airports from around the world were placed in one hangar.
They now employ four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
It's an unprecedented chance to know everything about the inner world of aviagawans.
Passenger registration, maintenance of aircraft, baggage traffic, even buses were entrusted to them in the airfield, stairs and passenger inspection.
And the passengers are in trouble.
One problem with the documents, the other delayed the flight, and the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to deal with all of this, like in life, within a minimum time frame.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the maintenance of the flight.
“A fine is being paid for their failure to perform the tasks,” explains financial analyst Dmitry Hilco in the interview of News Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of learning.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact become new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment”, says the Director of Public Policy in the area of training for workers and additional vocational education of the Russian Ministry of Science, Natal Zolotarev.
That's why students aren't up to global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
However, the estimates for this examination were quite substantial.
The newest smart-eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to our Instagram airport claim in a timely manner" - a happy participant in the game, Pierre-manager of the Frankfurt Airport, Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, it is called, were taken to prison to invite themselves to work at the time of graduation.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre's foreign literature at the Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government's unilateral decision to close the US Embassy Centre at the All-Russian State Library of M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The recent unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation have called into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments of the long history of our relations,” says Ambassador John Teft of the United States of America, at Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and strong links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as a meeting place with numerous American eminent persons, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year did the American Centre hold more than 400 cultural and educational events and receive more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, the diplomat stressed.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the Future Leaders Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal was quick to be executed.
Typical situation: Four officials are standing at the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claims for work.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order for you to rejoice over it, says Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we'll order all the buildings down.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by the rapid economic growth of the past decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 claims relating to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to cease the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: India has become one of the world ' s most overpopulated and polluted countries since India ' s declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development is slowing down for rapid urbanization: cities are full of heavy power, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes from enterprises and households, and few of the remaining dwellings are cut down by new residential areas.
Despite formal support from the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main cause of the abolition of major investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the court 's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes it is not possible for a court decision to be implemented within the time limit set by the court, according to environmental counsel Raj Panjwana.
However, the unfulfilled dedlinees have a positive side: at least they make the responsible persons move.
“His main goal is to shake this system,” adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished major constructions on several occasions: in its account, the closure of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller buildings.
People are also tried to remember, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
Such explanations, however, are far from readily understood by ordinary people whose lives can change because of a single splinter of the judges ’ feathers.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital before causing public outrage.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered from the Government of Delhi statistics on incoming and outgoing transport and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned from factories whether they were in a position to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, began to catch the attention of the court, people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gange River Cleanup Program, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Maudie last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and starts screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of the Gang on the statue of God, and the feces were in it, and the judge was hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Gang is Gang, he'll take away all our sins.
It's a river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The cleansing of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The current number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times.
Every year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million bathing Hindus die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund from the sale of his costume, where he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: the suit was purchased for $700,000, while the river’s treatment required at least eight billion.
The parties to the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
“In a developing country, environmental discussions are often seen as an inadmissible luxury,” says Malik Bhanot, activist of Call Ganga.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between environment and development."
The man poured blood on several paintings of Dali at an exhibition in Riga.
Visitor of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke windows in the museum and ruined the sculpture of El Salvador Dali "The Appearing of an Angel".

He immediately led the way inadequately: he ruined the sculpture, he broke the windows.
He then began to move around the premises and to seal up several pieces of permanent exposure with blood.
Among them is a portrait of the message of Myervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobechin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also corrupted.

Si Jin calls for the economy to be more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, President Si Xingin said on Tuesday, in addressing the group facing the task of managing reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing an open policy”, he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulations on investor access to the market, the revision of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SEE), which attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually improved through trial programmes.
This is an important step since it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken its control over the powers conferred on companies, thus ensuring that companies themselves would operate their own business.
