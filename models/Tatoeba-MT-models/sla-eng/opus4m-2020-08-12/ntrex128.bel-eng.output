Valiant extra MPs are worried about what looks like puppets.
Some MPs don't understand why their MP status should change into a member of the Wales Parliament.
The MEPs resented the plans to rename the local meeting as Parliament of Wales.
Members of all political opinion think that it's some kind of an ex-boyfriend.
One Labour MP said his colleagues are concerned that this rhymes with the words "stupid" and "stupid."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means "stupid", and pwp means "stupid".
The MP said that her group was completely dissatisfied and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservators said their group was ready to discuss a change in the name of the Assembly, but noted that it was a short-lived transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to a "marianette."
In this context, the Welsh word for it is worded the same as the Turkish English word u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting a law on making changes to the name, has made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly deputies call will, of course, be a question of the members themselves."
The Wales Authority Act 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals which showed broad support for calling it the Wales Parliament meeting.
As for the extra MP's title, the commission gave preference to the Wells Parliament member or to the PMP, but the CPP option got the most support in public consultations.
Additional deputies obviously offer alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus may be a major pain for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill of change over a few weeks.
The reform proposals will include other changes to the Assembly's work, such as rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committees' system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on what should be called when they carry out their mandated work.
Macedonians vote in referendum after country name change
On Sunday, voters are voting in favour of changing their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" or against that.
The national vote was organised in order to resolve the long-standing question of neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, it has been insisted for a long time that the name of their northern neighbour represents a claim against their territory, which has prevented Macedonia's activation and friendship with the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonia's President George Ivanov, a name changer at the referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that changing the name is a simple price to pay for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's Temple is shut up, the Harlem Churches are fighting for the existence of
"In the past, as the old people who I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"It's neither here nor there today."
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
"People have different intercourse and relation now," he said.
"Barry is no longer a cosy local inn where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he's concerned that the money from the sale didn't stop for as long a period as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living houses with candminias filled with people who will not help temples that will stay in the area.
"The vast majority of the inhabitants who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why it's quicker when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that the majority of the people who move into these condominiums will become the adherents of these churches."
Both churches were built by a group of whites before Harlem became a black district -- the Church of the Permanent Society in 1870; the Church of Saint Martin -- ten years later.
The original white Methodist society left in the 1930s.
The black community, which was praying nearby, had a right to property on the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a blacklisted public under the leadership of a like John Howard Johnson, who had appointed a boycott of traders at the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the returnees under the direction of Father Johnson had planned a reconstruction: they had brought in the operation of the corals.
Like David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the roe in the stick called it "Cultural Treasure" and "An irreplaceable Historic Tool."
An expert at Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also pointed out that this was the world's first Coryllion, played by a blacksmith musician, Diane A. Linde, who had moved 18 years ago to a larger kingdom in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Maryvester said that in the Church of St. Martin he had not been replaced.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complex story between architects and subcontractors, some of whom have been attracted by the false leaders of the church, some have been the diocese.
The heathen's east, which is the governing body of the chaplain's assistants, was written into the diocese with a warning that the diocese would "try to move expenses" to the east of the heathens, although the east did not take part in the recruitment of architects and subcontractors sent by the diocese.
Some came in complaining of an absence of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was wounded during a dive in California for the lobbying.
On Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy, who had been hunting lobbyists in California on the opening day of the lobbying season.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach Beach Beach, in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he had been hanging out with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming, asking for help, and then swam with the others to help him get out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just an excitement from the lobbying, but then he realized something bad had happened: 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his key was severed," said Hamel, adding that he noticed this when he came to the boy.
I called out to everyone, "In the water next to the shark!" added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to Reidy's children's hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of sharks which have attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' lifeguard stated at a briefing that the shark had been spotted in this place a few weeks earlier, but was determined that it was a secure variety.
Giles added that the victims were injured in the upper torso.
The officials closed down access to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and to ensure security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move on to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in universities where trained specialists will work.
As a result of significant advances to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothes and household goods decrease, larger ladies of beauty will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year that will demonstrate success.
Investments in beauty come from supermarkets looking for ways to fill spaces on shelves that have been previously occupied by TV sets, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it doubles the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw, which will appear for the first time.
An existing establishment by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments than those found in such shops as Boots.
Large shops also restart their Boutique cosmetics ruler, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly needed among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumery shop will be testing the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first to be opened last week in Croyden, South London, and the second to be opened in Sainsbury, Birmingham, late this year.
Shopping on the Internet and going to buy small amounts of products every day in local shops around the house leads to a supermarket having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Kupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said that trade points would become more and more like universities, because a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl discount companies with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's placed Argos' trading points in hundreds of shops, and had also placed several Habitats points since the two years ago acquired both networks, which, he said, had contributed to the increase in the sale of food products and had made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to split the revenue from the drugstores ended after a number of supermarket reviews.
A new strategy emerged after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business together with 281 Celesio drugstore owners Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds had played a role in this, extending the range of luxurious brands to look after the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty parlors to improve the conditions for our customers.
We've also invested in teaching our employees how to suggest their recommendations.
Our brand organization is designed to accommodate all kinds of needs, and the attractive environment and comfortable location make us the best house of beauty that opposes the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones came to his senses after Holly Willoughby gave up a deal of 11 million pounds sterling.
Star Dragons Den Peter Jones stuttered after television's Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million-pound deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilwaby doesn't have time for Truly's brand goods and accessories.
The business of the pair became like the brand Gwynet Peltraw Goop.
This morning's a 37-year-old leading announcer at Instagram that she's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with her lucrative business of creating brandy clothes to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was upset when a "gold" television girl admitted during a busy meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals amounting to 1.5 million pounds of sterling meant that she would no longer have time to deal with the domestic goods and accessories of Truly's brand.
The business was similar to that of Gwynet Peltraw Goop and it was doubled to double Willowby's well-being by 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones had flown from Great Britain and was on her way to one of his resting homes.
Source is: Truly was Holly's top priority.
This was her long-term future, which she saw in a couple of decades.
Her decision did not leave all the participants absolutely puzzled.
No one wanted to believe what happened on Tuesday; very soon it had to start a dinner.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe's apartment full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is one of the most important stars in the UK, can cost millions of dollars in money to companies because of huge investments in different goods, from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods and because of the possible further delay in their implementation.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Tray Willoughby and the husband of Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capep, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016 and 52 years old Jones joined the presidency in March.
The couple are resting together, and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television firm.
Willowby will be an M&S brand representative and replace Aunt McPartlin with the lead ITV "I'm A celebrity."
A source near Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his case."
A sincere conversation, "after which we fell in love"
He took it upon himself to criticise the media for comments he had made that he considered to be "non-Presidental" because it spoke positively of the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump much of what he refuses?
Trump said "dating" to his radiant voice.
"I refuse to do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore had been announced to Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denucleization.
But the talk of denuculation got stuck.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a North Korean diplomat, Lee En Ho, declared to be the world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday- -that the United States did not expect North to take the "appropriate sunsets" in response to North Korea's previous steps in the field of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the US continued to apply sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful at building relations with North Korea," he said.
'Everything could have ended the war with the North Koreans.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We've got good stories now."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completing rocket tests, helping freeing hostages, and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he was defending his extraordinary approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy for the president to stand by, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we're already going to have about 200 people," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Hundreds of people have died in the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia.
For example, after the firefight in Lambok, foreign NGOs said they weren't needed.
In spite of the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lamboca population had been relocated, it was not announced that a national disaster was necessary to provide international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to go to Poland and see if they can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutope, the representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indian officials were evaluating the situation in Poland to see if they would be allowed by the international agencies to provide assistance.
In spite of the earthquakes that Indonesia is always experiencing, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Ocheha, there are almost no shelters in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of siren to warn of tsunamis in the field has led to more casualties, though a warning was given.
Even in better times, movement between many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
And the actual disaster made it very difficult to make the logistics of movement.
A hospital ship, which had been placed on the wharf for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake, was approaching Paul, but the way to a new place of disaster would take at least three days.
President Joko Ododa has set up a campaign to improve Indonesia's broken infrastructure and has spent money on automobiles and railroads.
But the financing gap is being followed by the Jock administration as next year's elections are due.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of continuing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim representatives take on more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and shots and other cold weapons.
See, Daniel Staridge of Liverpool is pushing the ball away against Chelsea.
Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in premium league by comparing Saturday's 89th to the London-based Stemford Bridge.
Staridge got a transmission from Jared Shakira when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea Gate, which was at 1-0.
He made a cock-ball left of himself before making a shot at a distant stick.
The attempt ended by killing high under the top bar when a ball flew to the top right of the net.
The ball came flying over the head of Capa Arisbalaga, who jumped directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position to throw the ball, and players like Shack always tried to keep going as far as possible, so I just tried to win us as much time as possible," said Staredge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running conte, made an easy pass, not thinking too much about it, and just struck the ball."
Chelsea had 1-0 in the beginning of the second period after Belgian star Edden Azar had been killed by the 25th minute.
Attacking the blues in this match was done by Mateo Kovacic before returning to the helmsman zone and running into the Liverpool half-field.
The blacksmith quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
Then he made a effective blow by handing the ball of Azar to the gate.
Azar Circulated the defender and broke into the lower left corner of the farthest stick past Liverpool's Watchdog, by Elise Becker.
Liverpool competes with the Napoli Group Stage of the League of Champions at 3 o'clock on Wednesday at São Paulo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videaton in the UEFA League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Agency reported on a Sunday morning that the consequences of the natural disasters have been eliminated.
At a press conference, the representative of Sutopa Purvo Nugroha stated that according to the messages, many people had fallen into traps in the ruins of buildings that had fallen from a 7.5-point earthquake that had taken place on Friday causing a 7-foot high wave.
The Pal city, where there were over 380,000 people, was filled with debris from broken buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed.
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenheid, Merciside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with violent injuries in the Grayson-Muse area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police called to their people from that area, who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to address anyone who's near John Street in Birkenhed or see if they've heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on all the, in particular, taxi drivers who have maybe made some video to connect with us because they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation."
The police assistant confirmed that the woman who was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own house.
This afternoon a friend of mine came to the scene to ask me where it was found this morning.
Investigations continue, and the police said they were in the process of informing their closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse has just tried to get back into his apartment, but the police have told him no one is allowed in or out of the house.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The lodger now says it'll be a few more hours before they're allowed to come back.
The policeman explained to one person that the entire area now is a crime scene.
The woman wept at the scene of the event.
She said, "It's so horrible."
At 14:00 two police vans were in a fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
A few of the police officers were standing within the perimeter investigating a multi-room building.
All people with information must contact the @MerPolCC Police Department, dial number 101, or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800,555,111, calling 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last century-long blow to the story of "writing history."
His removal would be poetically fair for him to look like the Taliban extermination of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "stupidity" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace will be the object of these actions.
The English civil war iconocracy was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps poor Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas of the previous century.
The vivid representation of Mr. William Ham Tornikroft about Cromwell is a testimony to the thought of the 19th century and to a portion of the histography of something that many consider to be something that needs to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith stated The Sunday Telegraph: "Twilight many know from the end of the 19th century better than today, as a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is it quite a precise submission, the subject of lengthy historical debates.
It's no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who represents one side of that collision.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be marked and respected."
A murdering pig killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China.
"The man who is known only by name -- Yuan -- was found dead with torn arteries and flooded blood, next to the bread on the Lupanshu market in the province of Guizhou," the South China Post reported on Sunday.
A pig handler was preparing to introduce a vaccine to a pig in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Sinina in the Chinese province of Tsinha.
It is reported that he and his cousin came in Wednesday with the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighbouring pigpen was open.
He said that there was a great deal of blood in the pigsty.
According to the report, the forensic examiner confirmed that a 550-pound heron had crippled a farmer.
"My cousin's legs have been covered and damaged," said Wu, a cousin of mine.
A recording of the surveillance camera showed that Juan had gone to the market at 04:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
Market manager reported to Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on someone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the messages, the Yuan family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people, they're rare, but they've been before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years ago a pig weighing 650 pounds pressed a Welsh farmer against its tractor and held it as long as his wife hadn't scared the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act like a rolling hook.
"They're just playful.
They're biteable and very questioning... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to give them a proper amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rose's remnants will bring strong torrential rains to the Southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rose is forecast to be weaker because it's moving over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
But in the coming days, the Rose will bring floods to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
The rate of Roses, Hurricane 1 of the category, was 85 miles an hour at 5 a.m. on the east side of time Sunday, and it was fixed at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"The rose," as expected, moved north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure moving eastwards to the western coast of the United States begins to form over the Pacific. On Monday, when the Rose approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it begins to push the deep tropical moisture to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring in some parts of Mexico to 10 inches of rainfall.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the coming low-pressure area, is causing a strong downpour in the southwest in the coming days.
For places between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall, there are dangerous sudden floods, rural tides, and possible delays in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity is going to cause the amount of precipitation in the space to reach 2-3 inches an hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the northwest, especially in most of the Arizona area, rainfall is expected from two to four inches high.
Because of the tropical rains organized areas it's possible to experience a sudden flood within the framework of rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It would be very undesirable to walk into the desert on foot because of the possibility of danger of accidental precipitation.
A heavy rain can lead the canyons to become tumultuous rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by steaming winds and dust.
The coming low-pressure area will bring strong rain in areas off the coast of South California.
Chances of precipitation more than a half an inch can lead to a slight waste stream and make it slippery on the roadways.
It will be the first downpour in the rain season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to get near Arizona at the end of Sunday and early on Monday before the rain would rain everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in the neighborhood four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there are severe temperatures in the United States because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are getting rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to extreme temperature changes in the near future.
There's a good example of severe temperatures in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amaja, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer heat will try to increase and extend again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern U.S. states a warm October temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit due to the South Plains to the Northeast will begin.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is going to be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit high.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that there's a high probability of a higher temperature in the eastern part of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cován's listens.
Over 20 million people on six television networks have seen interesting testimony from witnesses Thursday in the Supreme Court in a case between Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continued, and the priests terminated their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news Friday: a settlement developed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it consisted of conducting a weekly indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that drunk Cavanaugh had grabbed her and was trying to pull her clothes off at a senior school dinner party.
Cavanaugh in his stick testimony said that at 100% sure it wasn't.
More than 20.4 million people who Nielsen reported on Friday looked at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with rating people who watch TV in offices.
To compare: size of the audience is similar to when playing the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported the Cavanaugh's appointment, managed all the networks in an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nielsen.
ABC took a second place with 3.26 million spectators.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate republican had issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters were shouting at his address and when he was trying to get up on the elevator to listen to the Trial Chamber.
He stood with his eyes open for a few minutes while he was swearing, and it was broadcast live on CNN channels.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
'Do you think he is telling the truth?'
He was told, "You have power, but a lot of women are deprived of it."
Flake said that his office had published a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee's hearings.
All cable and cable networks for a few hours were on a direct broadcast when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the question of selecting a Kwan candidate for the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do it, only knowing that the FBI would look at the charges against a candidate next week, and that Democrats from among the minorities would call it.
Flake was persuaded by some of the conversations he had with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kunss.
After talking to Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Select Flake had the strength because it was evident that the republican population would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the charges against Kwan at the FBI.
British Prime Minister May charges with criticism in the "policy game" because of the Brexito.
During the Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Tereza May accused the critics that she was planning on leaving the European Union as they were "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Tereza May arrived at a British Birmingham Conservatory Party conference on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, she had former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who was opposed to her so-called "cheque" de Brixita plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EC to have one fare was "very ridiculous."
Wade Sims' murder: The police arrested a man who was suspected of being killed by a LSU player named Python Simpson.
The police arrested a man who was suspected of being shot dead at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player with the Louisiana University team.
"A 20-year-old Deitéon Simpson has been arrested and put in prison for murder in a second degree," reported Baton Rouge, police leadership.
The officials showed up a video of a shooting between Simms and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
"Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had Simpson's DNA," says WAFB, CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson the police said that he confessed in a fatal shot to Wade.
“The cost of the facility is $350,000,” reports Advocate.
The following Friday's East Baton-Rose report said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department of Operations of the Louisiana State Police Department, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police Department, is asking residents in the area for help in an investigation to facilitate an arrest.
Louisiana University sports director Joe Aleva thanked the district's law enforcement authorities for their "contribution and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was only 20 years old.
Attacking six feet up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
In the middle of last season, he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball team coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team had been "dissolved" and "shocked" since Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," said Wade.
Volcano Dumps Ash at Mexico City
The ashes that erupted from the Papacatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Spooky Disasters on Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash were registered for 24 hours.
In the centre there was audible rumble and felt a jolt.
Findings in social networks have shown that around Mexico, such as Socimilla, there's a thin layer of papal coverage in a car windshield.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity that is located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the capital following a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Conflicting police with Catholic separatists the eve of an anniversary vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters encountered the police in a civil order, while thousands of others joined the demonstration in marking the first anniversary of the polarizing vote in the Catalonia department.
A group of separatists in masks, who were being held back by the public welfare police, dumped them with eggs and coloured them with powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the same day the fighting broke out when the police used their clubs to deter demonstrators.
For hours, groups of independence fighters, who had been chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive," faced the presence of trade unionists who were shouting "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the course of protests.
The tension in the region towards independence remains high one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid recognised as illegal but which marked the separatist Catholics.
Voters tended to be far more independent than most, although the voice of voters was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of voting.
According to data from the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations around the region as a result of angry demonstrators.
The groups in favour of independence spent the night of Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration went on, but the protestors had to go the other way.
A 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who is present in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer hopes for independence from Catalonia.
"We've had one of the best moments of the summer.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections of December last year, the Catalonian parties in favour of independence have tried their best to keep the momentum alive this year with many of their most famous leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile, or in prison, awaiting trial for the organisation of the referendum and the next announcement of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Pouch, who writes down a protest in support of the police on the phone, says that the conflict has been provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in the SIS since the end of last year, announced that he would be taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Creating as a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and reprisals we have ever seen from the government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after they ransacked their home in the car
Three men of age 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car had repeatedly fallen into a Londoner home.
The incident took place in the Belinogard-Crest area on Thursday about 7:30 P.M.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said that the gate and the building themselves were damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was fired in the car.
As a result of Menga's blow, Livingston beats Rangers with 1-0.
The first goal of Mangi's Valley for the benefit of Livingstone ensured their victory
Livingstone's success had been shaken by the Rangers, and it was enough to assign Stephen Gerard to 18 games to the Ibrox Club manager.
The hit of the Mangi Valley was great, because Harry Holt went up to one level with the Hypernian in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win the front-runners this season and meet the Harts team at eight on the following Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers of the League of Europe. They're hosting the Rapids of Vienna on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continued his playless series in the division to six games, and chief coach Holt still feels the decay after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone skips a chance because of rough visitors
The Holt team was due to warn you long before they killed, but this was the direction that called for various problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke out, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Litgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The landlords were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could bother the guests at some point.
And that's how it got to the top.
The Rangers allowed a penalty strike, and Livingstone made a debut, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to overcome Mengu, who made a pass and killed from the center of the field.
Up until now, Rangers had dominated but it turns out that the team's defense was inopportune and goalie Liam Kelly was practically not involved.
And it went on the second half, although Alfredo Marelos did save Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was shot off by Alan McGreggarr's Rangers goalie, and Litgo has moved far from Livingstone's second set.
The balls kept coming at the door of Livingstone and being bounced off, while two pennies after the Hulk had been summoned to replace Glen Middleton and the demand for hand-game punishment were denied.
Phenomenon from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Journalist Scotland Alesdere Lamant in Arena Tony Macaroni
The great productivity and results of Livingstone.
For men, they were wonderful, keeping ahead of waiting on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the higher echelon, but should be given due Holt for the way he has encouraged the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grand, building a well-organized defense, while Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Warall all over the field.
The Rangers didn't catch the inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they didn't meet those standards.
In the last match they did not own, only once killing at the gate that was something of a disturbing call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the list.
Mixed Treatment of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, we saw smiles and felt groundless flying when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day by which President Erdegano's disputing visit to Germany is aimed at restoring the relationship between the allies of NATO.
They quarreled over human rights issues, freedom of press, and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdogan was headed to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police fought for safety so as not to give a crowd of 25,000 people to meet in front of the ball, but a lot of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politics of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protestors against and reflect differences over the guest, whom one German Turk announced to be a hero and another was convicted as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: The router died when he encountered a car
A bicyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
There was an accident near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, brisk road in Deptford, in the southeastern city, about 10:15 A.M.
The driver of the car stopped, the paramedics arrived, but a man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another bicyclist died as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of a Saturday's crash.
The police said that their employees are working to track down the person and report back to his next of kin.
Near that point there were road gardens and bus stops, and it was recommended that the motorists avoid that area.
Long Lattin: Six employees injured during the riots
"Six foreign officials have been injured as a result of a riot in a prison of strict treatment for men," reports the Penitentiary Correction.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Wooster around 9:30 a.m. on Sundays and continue until now.
A special group, Tornado, was involved in the fight against riots that took place in one wing of eight prisoners.
At the scene of the incident, employees were treated for minor injuries.
The Penitentiary official said, "A specially trained tour staff has been directed to fight those who have committed riots in Long Lantin prison."
Six employees were treated after receiving injuries.
We can't take violence in our prisons, and we understand that they will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated in a hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October of last year, security officers were summoned to prison to deal with serious disturbances during which employees were subjected to attacks with water polo balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which could be useful for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely happen in Arizona, but that's what might happen at the beginning of next week, because there are traces of Hurricane Rose left in the south-western part of the desert that pose a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service was already publishing on Monday and Tuesday sudden floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, in south-eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that on Tuesday evening the Rose will take a direct route through Phoenix, approaching with the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a fall of pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The latest model of the National Center of Hurricanes is that of dropping 2 to 4 inches, with a level that can reach 6 inches in the Arizona area.
In other parts of the Southwest desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's likely to fall from one to two inches, with individual effective values up to four inches.
For those who are outside the risk of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could be long awaited because their region is suffering from drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be useful, as droughts are currently being observed in the southwest.
According to the data from the American Drought Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing an extraordinary drought in the second category," reports weather.com.
One is that the path of Hurricane Rose leads to the slowness on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles an hour at 385 miles south of Punt Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm collides with more cold water in the Pacific Ocean and hence is still silent.
So it's expected that in Mexico, at the advent of the tropical storm, there will be a river exit from the banks on a day or a night Monday.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which will pose a significant risk of drowning.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to north-west Sunny, where precipitation is likely to fall to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then the Rose will move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, before it reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning, in the form of a tropical fall of pressure, which will then continue through Arizona and the southern part of Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The main danger is expected from the Roses or the rest of it; it is a very heavy rain in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the Southwestern desert of the United States," reported the National Center of Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and creeps in the mountainous region.
An attack on Midsomer Norton: Four attempts to arrest murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple gunshot wounds in Summersett.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Terrase Excelsior district of Midsamer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stabilised" condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and both, 18 and 20, was arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summersett," said the police.
The police turned to anyone who might have had any evidence on the cell phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"The coffee is confined to the power and anger of the Democratic Party," Trump said.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of the abolition of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a rally in Willing, Eastern Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh is "suffering with subjugation and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his selection on a post.
The coffee gave rise to the Congress on Thursday intensely and emotionally refusing to blame Christine Blacy Ford for sexually rapeing her for decades when they were still teenagers.
The Ford also gave evidence during hearings about her accusation.
On Saturday the President stated that "in that day the Americans saw a brilliant, virtuous and courageous character" Kavanaugh.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of one of the most qualified experts in the field of our time, a lawyer with a great history of the public service," he said to a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president immediately took part in a selection of Cavanaugh, talking about the importance of being seen by the Republic during the interim elections.
"Five weeks left till one of the most major elections of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I am everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump: The Democrats have an intention of resisting and hindering.
"It is expected that the first key processional vote at the senate level on the selection of Kavanovo will take place no later than Friday," reported CNN, Senior Parliamentary Assistant.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia, the number of people affected is increasing
"At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the flood of gigantic waves on the beaches when a violent earthquake and tsunami broke out on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia," the government declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Paul City on Friday when waves six feet high fought about the shore in the twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5 earthquake, there was a tsunami.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't immediately escape and they became victims," said Jakarta Press Secretary of the Indonesian Agency for the Eradication of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho's Disasters.
"The shadows were pulling cars, logs, houses, hitting everything about the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (to 497 km/h) before it hit the coastline.
In his words, some people survived only because they had climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24th Field.
Aerial images, published by the Stable Disasters Agency, showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, bridges had been spinning and falling apart, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following jolts continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes happened in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a massive earthquake on Friday -- roughly 200 times the power of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow cove, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugrohi called the damage a "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost without news.
"The victims and damage may be greater along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) to the north of Paul, an area called Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," said Nugroha.
Dongal's connection "was completely damaged," explained Nugroh.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross statement, adding that its employees and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"It's already been a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely publicized for not reporting the Pol tsunami, but officials said the waves were coming at the time the warning was given.
In amateur images published on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building with despair screaming at people outside a warning of the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes the water wall fell off the shore, hauling buildings and cars along.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the withdrawn material.
The earthquake and the tsunami had caused a serious power cut, which had disrupted communication around the Pole, so it was hard for the authorities to recall the rescue efforts.
According to authorities, troops have started directing cargo aircraft through Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport was opened just to help and will be shut down by October.
On Sunday, President Joco Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Paul.
As a result, the Indian tsunami lost more than 800 people
It's really bad.
"While employees of the World Vision from Dengala were successfully arriving at the city of Paul, where workers were hiding in the bristles set in their office courtyards, on the road they saw scenes of annihilation," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief groups began to act gloomyly to start disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep news were prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, supply and staff from outside the border can only begin to occur if the site of the disaster is declared a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arryani, Indian Red Cross press secretary.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but we don't have that status yet.
On the second night in Paul, after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing were hoping that their near marvels would be among those who would leave the joyless cords of the ghostly disasters.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewers.
On Sunday the lifeguards liberated the woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her there was her baby's body.
Hendon Subandona, the coach of the Indonesian national team on paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing parades for the Asian games that had been completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including the others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"Being older in the field of paraplanerism I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told us a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel had been spread among the paratroopers community, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by one gray branch, and not by two blue branches.
"This means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the bank upheaval in Newport, Levi
"By Friday morning the thief had stolen $26,750 from a Brink employee who had put in ATM bills in Newport, Libya," the Newport police department reported in a press release.
"The driver of the car left an ATM in an amusing complex and was getting ready to deliver more money," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a release.
While he was busy, another man "ran out from behind a worker of Brynk" and stole a fur with money destined for delivery.
Several suspects were observed leaving the scene, as reported by the police, but the number of attendees was unchanged.
Anyone who has information about them needs to contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes its name to Ye.
Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
Announcing a change of name on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kayne West."
West, 41 years old, in Ye's name, was using this nickname as the name for its eighth album, which came out in June.
Changes take place the day before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to start his new Yandhi album.
He's replacing Ariane Grande's singer with a show that went down for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
Just as his current professional name, West, had been reduced, he had earlier said that it was a religious word.
I believe that ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible that is "you," said West earlier this year, referring to the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So it's you, it's me, it's us, it's us.
It came from Kaney, which means one, just Ye, reflecting our good, our bad, our frustration, everything.
An album is more about who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
There was a West employee, J.Z., who also did without connection and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against peaceful residents
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Abrador would never use military force against the civilian population because the country is approaching the age of 50 from the day of the bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza López Abrador obituaries "never use the Vays to pass the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers staged a peaceful demonstration in the area, which resulted in the death of about 300 people while left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Abrador obituaries support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to learners, thereby opening up more free places at state universities.
"The joblessness and lack of educational opportunities attracts young people to delinquent groups," he said.
USA needs to double funding to machine intelligence
"As China becomes more and more active in the area of machine intelligence, the US needs to double the amount that they spend on research in this field," says an investor and specialist in Kai Fu Li's machine intelligence, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even though U.S.A. did not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it was trying to be the first one in the MAI innovation field.
"The doubling of the budget for research in the area of I would be a good start, given that all the other countries are lagging behind from the US, and we are waiting for the next breakthrough in the area of Ml," said Lee.
"Double funding can redouble the likelihood that the next great achievement of MI will take place in the US," said Lee at CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superintendents of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hawton Mifflin Harkart, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the world's most famous companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mellan University, he was working on a machine intelligence system that won the highest American player at Atella, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department of Google in China.
Lee accepted previous US government technology competitions such as the U.S. Agency's advanced research project and asked if it would be next to help identify the following proxies.
"The US researcher often has to work hard to get state grants," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders; it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies in recent years have acquired luminaries from universities to work with MIs.
Did Lee say that changing immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the area of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards have to be offered automatically by candidates in the Ml branch," he said.
The Council of State of China published a plan in July 2017 for the development of the next generation's machine intelligence.
"The National Fund for Science in China provides funding to people in academic institutions similar to that of the National Science Fund and other state-owned organizations providing money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the United Center for Machine Intelligence, which should be attended by industrial and scientific partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Prelim Project Agency announced an investment of $2 billion called AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the study of MI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Command which had been trying to create the Commission's national security of machine intelligence has not watched for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which will allow us to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece that blocked applications to participate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is in Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim in its territory and has vetoed the accession of NATO and the EC.
In June both governments made a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalists say the changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slovenian population.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voter turnout would comply with the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum.
The question in the referendum is, "You're in favour of joining NATO and the EC by agreeing with Greece."
Proponents of change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a price that should be paid for admission to organs such as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievski, 79 years old, Skopje.
While this was not necessarily a legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name requires more than two thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no complaints of violations had been received by 1 hour.
However, the figure was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when it voted 66 per cent of the registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Skopje voter Jose Tanewski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Duska voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which opens the way for her to join the NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before the House of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged the chairs in front of the chambers set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We're in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to get together with our heads up, not through the service door," said the Cowdarks.
"We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to other people, like China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
The prime minister said NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
"I think the biggest number will be pro, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," said Zavoj after the vote.
He said yes to be the result of saying yes to our future.
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that a referendum will involve 30 percent to 43 percent of voters, who are below what is needed.
Another survey taken by the Macedonian telecoms showed 57 percent of those surveyed are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
In order for the successful Jacuzzi referendum, there must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow on the Transitional Government's policy since its arrival in May last year.
See, Sergio Aguera of Manchester City walks through the gate through British defenses.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguerre and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending Britain by winning Manchester City at 2:0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At 65 minutes ago, Aguera did it easily.
Argentine attack got a pass in the middle of the field.
He was racing between the three British defenders, before he hit the open field.
Then Aguera turned out to be one of the four green shirts.
He circled over one defender and overcame several more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the pass onto the left flank, finding Sterling.
English by attacking the first touch in the penalty strike of the game Aguerre, who was using his right strike to bypass the British goalie, Matthew Ryan, was struck right on the right side of the network.
"Aguera has some problems with her feet," said the reporter, the head of the city of Pep Guardiolo.
"We talked about how it played for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at the same moment."
But it was Sirling who gave Skye Blues the primary advantage in the struggle in premium league.
This goal was for the 29th minute.
The game has won this ball deep inside British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to LEROUS SÁNE.
Seine had made a few touches before Sterling could reach the bottom of the stick.
By attacking Skye Blues, he was pointing the ball at the edge of the net.

Heart wants to play picker points against Rocky
After the Nationals were shut down from the play-of competition, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But constantly competitive Schercer hopes to take a swing against the Colorado of Rocky on Sunday, but only if there are still the performances of Play-of for Rocky that remain in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The years had taken, at least, a definite place to win, with a number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first title on the division.
"Even though we're playing just that, at least we can handle the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and other team will be combined that the game is likely to be on the highest level of anyone I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a launch on Sunday, but they are reportedly willing to give Sugar a ball in such a situation.
Shercer, who was going to do his 34th start, was having a CPI session on Thursday and he's going to be on a regular vacation.

Trump plays in West Virginia
The President made an explicit reference to the situation around his election as Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm always fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means are needed, you see, brilliance, laziness.
They don't care who they hurt, whom they have to break in order to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
In his words, Democrats have the intention to "consist and prevent."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, negative and lying."
He was rescued by the Senate Court Committee on the previous recognition of the senator of the democratic group Diana Feinstein, who received a loud evaluation from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Do you want to store this password?
Uh-huh.
No, I don't expect it--it was a very bad nonverbal language- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the foundation church.
It is an intolerance to those who express their opinion
When activists Momentum in my local party voted in favour of hurting me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in a row of members of parliament from a labor party they say we're not welcome to have anything to say we are.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, got a similar return because she was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship has made me reveal myself that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, similar issues that Jeremy had disagreed with earlier leaders.
In a statement dated Friday at the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party- -they say, "we want these meetings to be local and proactive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from a labor party it was such a meeting they had on Friday
Unfortunately, today's meeting is not so much a promise of a "gooder, softer" politician's long forgotten, if ever really was.
It's becoming more and more evident that in a Labour party different views are not accepted, and every opinion is judged from that point of view, whether it's acceptable to a party's leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because of my former colleagues who I thought I shared the same political views, we started to expect me to take a step back, and we took a position that I wouldn't mention at all in matters of national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a week of insults happening in social networks calling for the re-election, condemning the central policy, saying I'm not in the Labour Party anymore.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been fortunateer than some of my colleagues, because the comments I received are generally political.
I'm fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who come across a stream of sexual or racist cases every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labarists Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not an organization that holds different views, and it's getting slower with each and every movement of uncertainty or party selection rules.
For the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that has urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Lebarists 32 years ago as a school student due to the neglect of the Tetcher government, which has made my apprenticeship a schoolgirl, I've tried to maintain the best public service for those who need it most -- let it be a local resident or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including those in the past few elections.
No one in East Nottingham could possibly get mixed up in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when a country is headed for Brexit, which is hurting the household, businesses and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy in my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not the Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, whether it's the Labours or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of renouncing elections, and the political purpose will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

IR-Melrose 38 - 17: Invincible IR at the top
Two later attempts might have said a few final results, but, doubtless, Air deserved triumph in this strangely interesting first-class game of Tenent's.
Now they're heading for the tournament table, the only side of a dozen.
After all, it was their highest defence, just as their best chance, which made their masters, coach Peter Murchi had every right to be content.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The robin Christ of Melrose said, "Give it up to Eyre, he's braver than we are.
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, turned by Fraser Klime, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, who was given to the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed on to an unfulfilled attempt.
The climate stretched out Air's leadership with a toolbar, before, straight at a time, he killed, and then made a salty attempt, making 17-5 Air stop.
But Melroses well began the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn the wealth reduced his resistance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruard Nott, who had been stretched out, and after relaunching Air moved on through the attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by the climates.
Air, in execution of Captain Blair McPherson's duties, received a yellow card, and again Melrose made another man pay with the unfulfilled attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of February pressure.
But the masters came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for kicking the Climate without a ball off the ticket line, McPherson landed behind Air.
The climate carried out its attempt to do what it did again almost after the re-launch, after Kyle Rowe had been hit by David Armstrong in the fine and sent Gregor Henry's flanker on to the fifth attempt by the landlords.
Star Steel Game looks like it's ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to join the hotel business industry after it turns out that it was appointed the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes, and he's taking a picture with a longtime comedy partner named Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next nine shows will be the last in the show series, and it looks like Kernan is planning to move on after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, although the source of the Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan was hoping to take part in the "April trade in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes that the court will open the way again to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol the military-marine headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea of the Right" is drawn.
Recovering is our responsibility.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict due to 19th-century resources is still alive -- as does the urge to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached the peak in the past decade, as Bolivia has been waiting for an international court ruling to take place on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Balvia has a pulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it awaits a positive result," said the Bolivian diplomat, Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe an MS decision on large screens across the country, hoping that after decades of intense negotiations the Court of Hague will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic President of Bolivia, who faces the challenge of winning next year's election.
"We are very near returning to the Pacific," he declared at the end of August.
But some analysts think that the court will hardly decide for Bolivia's benefit, and that's a bit of a change even if it does.
The AAN, based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments have been considered to show that the case was “not complicated”, declared the Chilean expert in the field of international law of the Zaz Zarote.
And far from without progressing the affairs of Bolivia, the last four years may have thrown her back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
In her words, the military rhetoric of Marales lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but having this conversation will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Edward Radríguez Velte, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was extremely quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "put an end to 139 years of strife with mutual convenience," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Marález, one of the most popular Latin American presidents, was using the marine problem as a political resistance.
"Balyvia never gives up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The proposition is that we can see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come before they can't trust the U.S.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ry Young Ho says his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
The Rhys spoke at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments appear to be on the verge of restoring nuclear stalemate with North Korean Kim Chen Yin more than three months after Singapore.
Rome says it's a "forgettable dream" to prolonged sanctions and an objection by the United States against the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington's afraid to accept the declaration if Phenyan doesn't start significant disarmament steps first.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, need to hold a second summit.
But there's a great deal of skepticism in the face of the fact that Phoenician is taking the arsenal for granted, which is probably the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pampeis plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
On the Paris fashion show we saw the new line in the massive headwear on the way to the shops in your towns
If you want to increase your hat collection or close the sun completely, you can no longer search.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a variety of extraordinary headwear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram came under the influence of unpractical hats, designers who sent their creatures to the podium.
The notable figure of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, ornamented with broad fields, similar to feathers which filled the heads of models.
The other accessories of an unusually large size included ornamented gem-stoned covens, a wizard's hat and even an pineapple, but they were not intended to keep his head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a collection of humorous masks -- right up to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with their lips sewn up, and more like the eye of Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of them looked like a seamstress with pipes and protective glasses, and the other one was like a molten cone of ice.
And, if you keep on applying these huge fashion attributes, you're lucky.
Those who follow style predict that giant hats can break into our daily lives.
Huge hats go up to the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with two feet wide, which can be seen at all, from Ryan to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was loosed in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium -- a straw beach bag almost as big as the model with this bag dressed as the buyer.
A black-and-orange rag bag, decorated with an armpit and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the collection of Jacques La Riviera SS19 at Fashion Week in Paris.
A famous styleist, Luke Armitage, said to Faceae: "I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a great impact, and it would be difficult to ignore the temptation for unstable accessories."
Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have been maintaining academic success since 2018, with another great result from examinations that are supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other beginnings of society.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to train their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and their places as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and install an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Since the final exams of this year, we've seen languages take their first place in the league table, with the highest score points in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher class A in Chinese, while 72 percent reached level A in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now chosen as subjects in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission shows that, among the reasons employers have had trouble filling vacancies, 17 percent have been associated with language skills shortages.
So more and more speech skills are needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
In view of the more promising jobs that language requires, these skills become indispensable in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you take, learning a different language, in the future, it's going to be a real advantage if you have that kind of skill in your life.
Contact directly with people from other countries automatically puts many people in the lead among competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, which involved more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak well enough in a foreign language to have a conversation, and French was the only language that spoke ambiguous percent -- 15 percent.
That's why investment in language learning is now important to children today.
There are several languages available, especially in the developing countries, that will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland every school will be distinguished by the languages taught in it.
A series of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice from several languages with a teaching staff that is a specialist in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to provide a learning environment that will train and equip children with the skills they need to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It is now impossible to deny that in a global business environment languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "the habits of international communication."
Independent schools will continue to suggest this option, this variety and preference for young people in Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron Debates Sunday at San Diego
Starts waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James is playing the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it takes, yet to determine.
"That'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers official site.
Cor. Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James is likely to be playing in restricted minutes.
In harmony with the practice that took place this week, James was asked about its plans for the "six pre-seasonal game schedules".
"I don't need pre-seasonal games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump performance time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is about to launch a series of shares for the company.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled talks for the next week, including pauses in friendly places, Tennessee and the Mississippi.
When the vote is confirmed on arrival to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to strengthen the support of intermediate elections as Republicans risk losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia, and how do you want to view it online?
The Trump performance in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see a Trump statement on the Internet from the WVL below on YouTube.
Trump will most likely consider hearings this week on a nomination to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh, who has issues with sexual harassment charges pending confirmation at the Senate during the week of the FBI's investigation.
But the main purpose of those statements is to help the Republicans who are standing before the November election.
Thus, President Trump's company announced that these five speakers next week are "to activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Controlling Congress is so important to its order of day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states since we are entering a tense season of the campaign," said Reuters' representative of Trump.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today's action can attract fans from Agio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of Pittsburgh media," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a senate candidate from West Virginia to Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president has to come and try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Raider's Cup 2018: US Team progresses to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three lop-sided sessions on a Saturday afternoon, perhaps it was what Ryder's Cup needed for it.
And the pendulum of the swinging impulse is a fully-generated, competitive concept in which players can honestly believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they tell the ping now?
"They had the advantage with six points, and now they have four, so I think we're going through it with a little momentum," said Jordan Sleep, walking about the day.
The advantage of Europe is, of course, four points forward, and we have twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spitch says, feel that they have had a slight wind blowing, and they have something to look forward to, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and anyone can boast of three points of four.
The spirit was mortal from T-shirts to green and is an example.
These guttural festivities were getting louder as his round lengthened, and he tripped a decisive blow to play the match on the four fields when they and Thomas stepped two by two.
His punch, which allowed them to win the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, like something that tells you that he thinks the American team is not off.
"You have to just take a deep breath and worry about your own game," said Spiti.
Already each of these players is gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spite and Thomas are French robins and Tommy Fleetwood, the harmless story of Ryder's Cup.
The strange but magical couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Malywood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday afternoons, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday mornings, Fridays and afternoons on Fridays.
It happens, and as their energy seems to flow to this tempestuous crowd and from it, it confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than the Fleet or the robins.
And you want to do it both ways in different holes.
The talk of European fame remains untimely.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergey Garcia, the hero of the morning coach when he was in touch with Alex Norenn.
Boggie and the two doppelgangers in the front nine broke out a Spanishman and a Swede to him with which they had never been able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the match of four swords and fours, it is so interesting to observe for so long the interaction between the folding of pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not implement, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has thus become the best team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth meeting it is also indicated that the US team is committed to a struggle in which some have doubts, particularly in the United States.
Europe goes out to the 10-6 Cup of Ryder finals
Europe will have a good edge on the last day of Ryder's Cup after it comes out of the four ball games Saturday and four with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and France's Malinari marked the struggle with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results of Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in an effort to preserve the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, reigned in the American office of discontent in the morning, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the four-ball match by winning two matches, but they failed to do more.
In order to save a trophy, Jim Furik's side would have to score eight points out of the 12 single games a Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Malinari, who got the name Molliwood after a sensational weekend, is only the second pair that won four points in their first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
Having beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in four games, they were wonderfully entangled to win the downfall of Woods and the American champion of Brian Decombe 5 and 4.
Woods, who held himself after two games on Saturday, showed a random flash of glitter, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four games and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rousseau, resting on x-balls of four, went back to his partner, Henry Stanson, in four-ball matches to two-and-a-one, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cope, taking one second place in the world.
Europe had no way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day south of west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time chief winners, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, established a checkpoint for Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four games and came back later to win Puller and Rory Mclroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cup Ryder did the team come back from a deficit of four points which goes solo, though it's only necessary to paint to keep the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were the best, a counterattack on Sunday looks like they're going to get away with it.
North Korea says that "no way" is going to disarm in one direction or another without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations was continuing sanctions that would strengthen mistrust towards the United States and that in such circumstances the country could not give up nuclear weapons in a lopsided manner.
Rio Yoon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year, North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill," such as stopping nuclear and missile trials, decommissioning the nuclear testing zone and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the appropriate answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no first and foremost disarming yourself."
Despite the fact that Ri republished his customary North Korean complaints against Washington's "stepping" approach to dinosaurisation, in which North Korea was rewarded because it had taken steps forward, his statement turned out to be considerable in that he did not deny a one-sided declaration of denuclearisation that had been done by the Phenians in the past.
Ri came across a joint statement by Kim Chen Yen and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the US Presidential Summit and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim pledged to work on the road to the "Denucleation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years old, but the United States stated that Phoenician must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been urged to rescind severe international sanctions in respect of North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on 'denuclearization' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner and even oppose 'the end of war'," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unforgettable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
The Ri didn't mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States had marked earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months, and added, "If South Korea and not the United States were to participate in this issue, the dunection of the Korean peninsula would not become such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from that of last year when he spoke to the AOA General Assembly that the U.S. continent targeting North Korea was inevitable after Mr. President Evil Trump called Kim a suicide rocket.
Last year, at AOon Trump, who threatened to kill North Korea with a kiss, praised Kim for his boldness in taking measures of disarmament, but said there would be a lot more to be done, and the sanctions must remain valid until the pair is denuclearized.
Trump reported on Wednesday that he didn't have a time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
The Security Council said it's worth the effort to reward the Phoenician for the measures they've taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "The execution of the Security Council's sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we are sure of the full, final and verified Dynuklearization."
The Security Council stepped up sanctions against North Korea in 2006 to try to stop funding the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.
Pompeis met with Ri in the Security Council calories, and the General Assembly announced that next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeia has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been successful.
In July he left Phanyan, stating that progress had been made with the North Koreans for several hours during the talks, ended with a visa application that he was requiring "like the gangsters."
Meeting with Mun this month, North Korea called for the elimination of a missile installation and a nuclear facility when the United States took "appropriate measures".
Trump said that, according to Kim, the "appropriate measures" he was waiting for were a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, D.C., which Trump promised in Singapore.
The Harvard students are taking a proper rest.
The new Harvard University course this year is designed to train students to sleep better, and it's designed to fight culture by night with coffee in their hands.
A scientist has concluded that students in one of the world's best universities often don't know how to look after themselves properly and how to maintain their health.
Charles Chaseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at a hospital called Brigham and a female hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first in his life in the United States.
Inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on education, he began his course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did they tell me this just now, in my last lesson?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep--it surprised me," said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year's class, set up by a student, explain why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement and improve the general mood.
Paul Barreiro, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health at the university, said that the university had decided to take a course after finding that students were often deprived of their sleep for a week.
The course that lasted an hour includes several interactive tasks.
In one section there's a picture of a room in the internet where students are pressing on coffee cups, curtains and books that talk about the impact of coffee and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports indicators and the importance of sleep habits.
At the next stage, participants are told how a long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know that it doesn't immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we think that they should know this as well as everybody knows about the consequences of smoking for health," added Professor Chaseler.
In his words, the nighttime culture still exists, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which is an increasing problem.
"A secured adequate good-quality dream must be a 'secret weapon' of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid excess weight, as sleep deprivation keeps the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemical and physical biology, was helping Professor Chassler develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all your guides to complete the same education program before they graduate from university.
Professor Chaseler recommended that the student be able to set the clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, noting the harmful effects of the "blue light" that are emanating from the screens of the monitors and the LEDs that can change the daily routine, which leads to sleep problems.
"Livingstan" 1:0 Rangers: Menga kills Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered one more stroke when Dolly Mangi's goal was that Stephen Gerard didn't get 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Aibrax wants to write his first victory on the way to a 4-1 triumph in February in St. John's, but Gary Holton's team is already carrying Gerard's second run as a manager with 18 games to leave eight points on its side, away from the leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before stopping, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not look as if they were suffering from a parasite.
As the Rangers go down to sixth place, Livingstone comes to third place, and then there's the Hibernians with the differences in the balls.
There may be additional problems for the Rangers after Fort Colum Spence has to be cured of head trauma after he's had his subject thrown out of the rostrum.
Gerard made eight player changes, so Ira didn't play semi-finals with Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under the 11th room, which allowed me to pick up a item from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they went by their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers had more control over the ball, but Livingstone made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill already two minutes when Maggie first directed the ball through Scott Pittman's gate to Alan McGreggar, and then the half-defendant took that chance.
A successful penalty strike by Jacobs Cagan was carried out by Craig Halkett, but his partner in protecting Alan Litgow was able to strike a strong blow from behind.
Rangers have seized control, but in the last third of the game, more expected to be killed than expected to demonstrate a good game.
Alfredo Marelas must have been punished with a fine of a quarter an hour before the end when he and Stephen Loveles met in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept the complaints of Colombia.
Rangers only managed to hit the gate in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox Liam Kelly, who was the goalkeeper, almost gave Lassane Coolibali and the effective Avi Ehariya attack.
Although it might have been against the first goal at 34 minutes of Liv's active game, no one is denying that they have to demonstrate a good game to the outsider.
The Rangers couldn't break through Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who was blocking Menga for the opportunity to be killed at the gate.
Gerard replaced the Coolibali with Ryan Kent, and it gave an effective kick when the attack broke through to Marelas, but an impressive Kelly ran and blocked the blow.
But Livingstone continued to meet the visitors by playing that game, which they liked to do, and Litgo and Halket continued to split the ball after a long struggle.
Holt's side was only able to prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor was playing well to resist Jacobs before Litgos set out for the bench.
A replacement for Rangers Glen Middleton happened the next time he was punished with a fine when he ran into Jacobs, but Tomson managed to duck.
So this is the inventor of Geiger's counter.
The page from our Almanac is Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLICI... the day of the future physicist Ian Wilhelm Hager, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that resulted in a device known as Geiger's counter.
Geiger's counter has become a part of science, and he's shown up in pop culture, just like in the 1950 movie "Koranad," in which the famous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans seem to be involved.
Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you're putting on headphones you're actually able to hear the sounds of atoms that are expressed as radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say, is it really shaking right now?"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to "see" cancer cells.
The new anticancer vaccine can help the immune system to "see" the bad cells and destroy them.
It's as if it teaches the immune system to recognize the bad cells that are going to be part of the cure.
The way to view it is to get immune cells from a patient and change them in the lab.
Then cells can see the proteins distributed in many cancer cells, and then they can re-enter the cells.
The sample vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different cancer types.
One woman who had received a vaccine that helped her immune system to recognise cancer cells found that carcinoma of the carcinoma was disappearing for 18 months.
The way it involves getting immune cells into a patient, changing them into a lab so they can see HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then re-entering it.
That's what Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesas, Maryland, said, and our findings show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anthrax cells that fight cancer from the breast, ovaries, lungs, and fat cats," said Professor Berazofski.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "teaching" them to achieving cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukosis.
Kanye West began a discussion in Trump's support with the MAGA title after it appeared in the CNL.
That didn't turn out well.
At the studio on Saturday night Kanye West was shot down after a performance where he was bragging about the United States. President Donald Trump said he was going to run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "City-Prive," when he was in the hat "Make America Great again," he spoke out against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to the white people, and they said, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL was playing with the main role of Matt Daiman, where the Hollywood star was expected to testify against Brett Cavanaugh in front of the Senate court committee on a case of sexual violence against Christine Blacy Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of the West fell into the frame and were loaded into the social media by Chris Rock.
I didn't know if Rock would try to get away with the West.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They interfered with me behind the scenes.
And they said, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They blackmailed me.
"And then they say I'm in a bad place," he said, reporting the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see a spot where there's no water?" And he said, "Well, what does it mean that he can't tell me what to do?
Try to love.
Because of his statement, at least twice, the SNS closed the hearing, and representatives of the SNA got confused with a message from the Verity.
West was adopted as a replacement for Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
The West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water of Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA party, Kendes Turner, who tweeted, "Thank you for your support."
But what Karen Hunter, who led the show, said was that the West was just who it is, and it was always wonderful.
"But I've decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art," which I believe embraces and distorts the ideology that is hurting my community.
He's free.
"It is the same as us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name by saying that he was now called "the Kane West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and went after Didi's footsteps, also known as Puff Didi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called the noose of Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music that changed its name to a symbol and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted homicide at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after being attacked on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Balihocamore as reported by the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday in the Belfast court.
The prosecution will be tried by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harrington's "Gulne Thrones" star captured idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his waving sword and John Snow's role in the HBO Middle Ages series
But a 31-year-old actor got a macho stereotype which means young boys often feel more strongly about respect.
Speaking in the Sunday Times Culture department, Keith said he thought "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
A whale, who recently married its neighbor on the Gule Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, has admitted that it has the power to solve this problem.
"I feel like a particularly strong guy, when we've been wrong about courage," he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up from the point of view that we see now?"
The whale believes that television should be responsible for being violent because of very male figures.
He went on to say, "What's in the beginning, and why should I teach it?
Why do you teach on television and in the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be so sure to be the right person?
I think that's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how are we going to change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In the interview he also admitted that next summer the series was going to end, and he's going to get out of the field of the series and won't do the buckets or the syquaws to the Game of Thrones.
From the November of Keith will begin to revive the real Western Sam Shepard, who is the historic director of his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said he thought meeting Rose's wife would be a better opportunity to finish the Thrones game.
"I've met my wife in this show, so I've got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The Rose was played by Ygritte, a character whose hero, Keith John Snow, is in love with this fantasy show, awarded to Amy.
The couple opened in June 2018 at Leslie's mansion in Scotland.
HlV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HlV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to safety information, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were passed on through sex, as they were in the past.
Traditionally, HlV infection is spread in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people infected with HlV infection by blood transfusions has fallen to almost zero," said Chinese officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
But every year, the number of people living with HlV and AIDS in China is up by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem for the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT-humans is still there.
Because of conservative values in the country, about 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread out from lack of knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been universally accessing HIV drugs in an effort to solve this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fusion of data, the danger and the theory of speech by her employees in parliament
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped the charges on Saturday that her employee had posted personal information about the three U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
L.A. Democrat said there's a claim against top wing players and their websites.
'A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies,' said Waters in Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. sense: lindsey gram from south queen and mike lee and oryn hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during a Senate commission hearing on sexual harassment charges against a member of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh appeared on the Internet Thursday.
A little while after the three senators interviewed Cavanaugh, the leak took place.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP addresses of the sources were linked to Waters' office and that they were sharing information from a Waters team worker," Hill reports.
"That's an unreasonable statement, totally false and absolutely false," continued Waters.
"My team member, whose data, personal information and security were compromised by these fraud and false accusations, and he was in no way responsible for the flight of this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is totally false and absolutely false."
Waters quickly criticised the Internet including the former White House secretary, Arya Flesher.
"This is a denial of anger," wrote Fleischer.
This testifies to the fact that she has no courage to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone is accused of not doing that, they must not be angry.
They must not behave offensively.
They must not question the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and good-natured.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too upset during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarra, a candidate from the Republican Party, who chats and participates in mid-term elections, also made statements in Twitter.
"It's a pain in the ass if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and legal authorities about these false allegations.
"We guarantee that the culprits will be found," she continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of the employees of my team."
Overview of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes a blow against the fictional spy Rowan Atkinsan.
Now it's a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXSIT in any new film with a British angle, and it seems to be in Johnny English's comedy and action franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and lasted in 2011 under the title "Johnny England's Ascension."
Can the saturrek well be expressed in terms of how obviously stupid we look when we talk about new possibilities of export?
Anyway, the second time that he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnnie English got an opportunity to laugh at things -- his name was louder than any comic creature he'd ever made for non-English spectators in cinema.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, in spite of his bizarre claim to glamor, got a little bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a little bit of a guy who brought a single note to Hor the fire at the ceremony of the 2012 Olympics opening in London.
Initially his character was based on the traveller and the international mysteries of Atkinson, who had once played into the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few nice moments here that we haven't had before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval prosperity, and pounding his rotter's spade a little on his helmet.
Dar Atkinsan for theatrical comedy is a very strong demonstration, but humor feels weak, and so strangely especially when serious movies like Agent 007: Mission Incomplete surely offer comedy as the main part.
Humour feels as if it's not just for adults but for children as well, and even the silly accidents of Johnny English are not as inventive as the silent films of Atkinsan in the face of Bin.
Great Britain's biggest industrial problem at this point in a long time.
A cyber hacker hacked into a super-secret community of British spies in the UK by uncovering the names of all British agents on the ground, until the disappointment of a undercover agent is unfortunately Kevin Elden's small role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is proud and mixed with things that are already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can with this Quasi-Tresai May, but there is nothing in the script to do with that.
Her intelligence advisors report that, since each real spy will be revealed, she will have to engage one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, everything gets complicated: he now works as a sixth teacher in a bunch of high school institutions, and he teaches a lesson in being an undercover operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Music the lessons of espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and joined with his former longtime friend Bo, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Presently Bo has a marriage bound to a crew of submarines, whose role Vicky Pepperdine played a bit in vain.
So Batman and the robin are getting terribly wrong in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is getting a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire who says he can solve problems with British hackers -- the notorious Jason Walt -- played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as an waiter, burn a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board a luxury Volta yacht; English does pure anarchy because it tries to use the characteristics of virtual reality to explore the interior of Volt's house.
All the moments extended for the last event, but as pleasant and noisy as ever, there are quite a lot of kids in the television set.
Pretty good stuff.
And how come I couldn't think about other Johnny English movies, because the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrated his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British for the four-day working week with pay in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's work party should consider a radical plan where the British only work four days a week but pay them five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to pass on the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It looked as if the employees were going to enjoy the three-day weekends, but they were still going to get the same salary.
The source points to an icon matching the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to the workers' support.
The union congress approved the transition to a four-week week period as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
An older source in the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "The planned survey will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but a four-day job week is an idea that matches the vision of the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse this idea, the Green Promises to spend a four-week week working on a joint campaign in 2017.
However, efforts by the Labour Party at large are not supported.
A representative of the Labour Party said, "A week's work is not a party policy and it's not a party's concern.
Chancellor John McDonnell has been using his conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he'd decided to reinstate the power from the "unlawful directors" and "managers" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also suggest that the current water shareholder may not get back the whole stock because the Labarists government can make a "calculation" on the basis of the alleged abuses.
He also confirmed that he was planning on putting the work into the boards of companies and creating joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of his own funds to private companies that would have annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Candy, told us for "60 Minutes," that following the FBI that works with Cavanaugh, we need to change our minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh was postponed to final vote on his election to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it is a matter of whether or not the Republican senators' bureau will be able to support it.
In an interview with a 60-minute "60-minute" reporter, Scott Pally asked the Republicans Johnnie Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about "Sensence" and "Can the FBI reveal anything that might lead to change."
Candy turned out to be more open than his South Queen colleague.
'I mean, of course,' said the Kennedy.
"I said, going to court: I have spoken with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after that and asked him the reason for the accusation, and said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive and unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Cavanaugh has decided that this is going to be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's a definite denial," added Graham, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"And everyone she calls has not been able to believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
There's an International Festival in New York this Saturday: an annual music event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Society's Festival will be held on a large stretch of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendez's concert, and they will learn about the real purpose of the event, the end of poverty and the end of it by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil Society Festival is the continuation of the Global Project against the International Propaganda Group, which hopes to stop poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to a company (if you do not want to pay a VIP ticket) visitors have to perform a number of tasks, be a volunteer, email the leader of the country, call any other people, and raise awareness of the purpose of poverty reduction.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert with a real way of convincing people that they need to be active, or is it just another case of what's called "clictivism" -- people feel like they're doing the right thing by signing online petitions or by sending tweets?
Since 2011, the organizers have declared that they have set aside more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters who are committed to achieving different goals.
They say that these actions have helped to drive influential leaders to commit more than $37 billion, which can affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had brought in 390 comments on commitments and applications for an amount of at least $10 billion that had already been disbursed or raised.
According to the group's assessment, the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the UK, "helping children grow up in full volume", a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help prevent food shortages in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from citizens.
"In support of the governments of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can bring about a social injustice of history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares had been held that called for better nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government had announced funding for a project called for food aid, which reached 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the frequent questions on the website, "what makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival replied, "This will be a long and arduous path; sometimes, we'll have to endure the decay and fail."
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to succeed, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are one of the few personants who will host the New York event this year, which will be led by Deborah Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
The US may use the Navy as a roadblock to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Washington may, if necessary, contact the Navy to prevent Russian energy from leaving the EZ and Middle East markets," said US Secretary Ryan Zinc, Washington Examiner.
The conclusion that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it works under the invitation of a legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as much as they want in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the clerk, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, through the Navy, to ensure the openness of the sea routes, and when necessary to organise a blockade so that their energy may not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed members of a company organised by the Energy Consumers Alliance to a non-profit group that positions itself as a "vote of energy users" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia "the one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when Trump's administration wants to significantly increase the export of its acidified natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
For this Trump administration, including the President himself of the United States, Donald Trump, is trying to convince Germany to get out of the "wrong" pipeline project of the North Stream 2 which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into the "burning" of Moscow.
The image has repeatedly underlined that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which costs $11 billion to power an existing gas pipeline up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's tough opposition to this project is taking on economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have a single view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans got a blow in return from Germany, which reconfirmed their project preference.
The main German organisation, representing industry, the Federation of German Manufacturers (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrialists' Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion about her participation in the 2020 presidential election, states the senator from Massachusetts.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his election as president after the interim elections.
During a speech in Halioki County, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a role.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and manage our ineffective government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, "as per The Hill."
"After 6 November, I shall consider very seriously the possibility of running for office."
During Warren's speech, she gave up on President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote in her tweet, "Surely before the vote, the FBI needs to investigate."
However, a survey Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think she should be running for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Safalk University/Bostan Globe political research centre, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator shouldn't be running.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed more support from former Governor David Patrick, where 38 percent was in exchange and 48 percent were in favour.
Other famous names among the Democrats that were discussed in connection with the 2020 potential polling include former Vice President Joe Byden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Biden, he's going to make a decision by January.
At a convention in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned Trek Palin's post-traumatic syndrome
26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq following a September call for service.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after his return I can compare with the results of his post-return oesophageal syndrome and injuries that our soldiers return to in the other families," she said as she pulled herself together in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pauline called this arrest "a sick question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, "returned a little bit to others, hardened, returned with the question of whether there was that respect for which the soldiers, the pilots, the other warlords, gave themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing attempts to report domestic violence, intoxicating weapons, according to information provided by Dan Bennett, secretary of police department at Vasila.
18 states and district of Colombia support an objection to a new policy providing a haven
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support objections to a new US policy, which denies docking victims of gang pressure or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts of Colombia dropped an analysis report Friday in Washington to support an objection to a port policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v.Sechnes case, which was opened in August by the American Union for Civil Rights against Federal Politics, was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his friends with the hard gang" had raped her, but the U.S. authorities on July 20 refused to dock.
She was detained in Texas.
The U.S. Attorneys who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the largest number of requests for shelter in the United States, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. port policy changed the 2014 immigration appeal commission's decision, allowing immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to come to the port.
District Attorney-General Carl Reissin stated on Friday that the new policy "ignors the tens of years of academic experience in states, countries and the world."
"Federal enquiries require port applications to be based on the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates that principle," the analytical footnote said.
Lawyers also said in a note that policies that deny immigrants make the economy of the United States worse, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and create jobs that are needed.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sachs ordered in June that immigration judges no longer give shelter to the victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Prosperity is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views," said the June 11th Council, announcing this policy.
The haven never meant to solve any of the problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
A desperate lifesaver in Paul. When they tried to find the survivors, the number of lives went up
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very stressful," said 35-year-old Rice Kusum's mother, comforting her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Paul.
Every minute the machine brings in the bodies.
Clean water is very little."
The lodgers began returning to their destroyed houses, unpacking wet things, trying to save anything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damaged by a 7.5-ball earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke the spine and shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Paul, where patients are treated in the street because of the strong pushing which is repeated.
In his eyes tears appeared when he remembered the feeling of strong underground jolts in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was clogged under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, adding that his family had come into town for marriage.
'I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador charges China with threats using a propaganda advertisement
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump mentioned China Daily's payroll in Des Moines Register, the state's most selling newspaper, after accusing China of being able to vote in the US Congress on November 6. This is an indictment by China.
The accusation of Trump that China was trying to get involved in the American elections meant that American officials in a conversation with Reuters were called a new phase in Washington's campaign under pressure from China.
Although the placement of an advertisement by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, Beijing and Washington have now unleashed a trade war that has resulted in a reciprocal imposition of tariffs on imports.
The repressive tariffs, declared US and Chinese experts, were introduced to injure such an exporter as entrepreneurs from the state of Aya who support the republican Trump party.
Teri Brunsted, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, China's leading farmer of agricultural goods, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in an article in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is now doubling its efforts by printing a propaganda advertisement in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Brunsted.
"And when you look at Beijing's newsstands, there you will find not so many voices against and you won't see a real reflection of other assumptions that Chinese may have about a dangerous trajectory in economics, given the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has given up the offer" to print his article, although he did not call it that newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women out of their pre-elections with Kavano Fiasco, warning analysts
While many prominent Republicans defend the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Cavanaugh's post in front of several charges of sexual violence, analysts have warned them that they will get a blow in the back, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Ryhar, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Richard stated that it was not certain that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizon)'s statements of an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm down the angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and November," Carin Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national press secretary of the Movement on the Washington paper, Columbia.
On Friday morning, protestors screened "November Quickly!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall when Republicans in control of the legal committee decided to put up Kavano's candidacy in spite of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's statement, according to Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be tremendous," said Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and it's true.
But they can be even taller, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 who don't want to like the president, but don't often vote."
Even before the Ford statement, in which she detailed her indictments for a candidate for the Supreme Court in sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, they may have a strong blow in return.
"It's a mix-up for the Republican party," said Michael Style, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether it's about whether Cavanaugh's going to take office, it's about how the Republicans did it, and how they did it," remarked Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities of the United States, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, it looks like the Americans were splitting up in the matter of right-wing Ford or Cavanaugh, but a little bit more favoured the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents are probably or are not very confident about Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they probably don't trust Cavanaugh very much.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh might have lied in his statement and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the push by the Flake FBI is investigating the charges by Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week Ford made a statement under oath to the Senate's Legal Committee that when he was drunk he was reaching out to her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that a candidate at the Supreme Court demonstrated his genitals to her on the evening of their studies at Eile in 1980.
The inventor of the world's web plans to start a new Internet connection, so that you can build a new web site to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world network, is launching a startup that will be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of a legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that's built on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose the location of the data stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company Berners-Li, he said that by creating Inrupt, he meant "control of the world."
"You have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"That's historic."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "their own data storage on the Internet" or a sub.
This can contain contact lists, e-mail lists, calendar, fanotecan and many other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal repository used on the Internet is that only a user can determine who has access to which type of information.
The company calls it "the personal enhancement of the data potential."
According to the CEO of John Bruce's company, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company an opportunity to pool resources, process and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The campaign now consists of Berners Li, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought that brings together a number of developers working on a project on contract and valant encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using the Inrupt website.
Brners-Lee said that he and his team did not speak to Facebook and Google about whether or not to bring about a complete change if all their business models were immediately reviewed.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday, a publication on the subject of Medium Berners-Lee wrote that mission Inrupt "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect integrity and as a new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the internet into a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in favour of net neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners Lee will become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new age of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Honoring the clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in the first world war
The only clergyman of the Church of England, rewarded with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a member of the fighting, was marked in his city after 100 years.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vane was rewarded on September 29, 1918 for his part in the Belengliz and Leakur attack.
However, four days later he was killed by a bullet-sniper and never found out that he had received the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Narthamptanshire two of his grandchildren in the parade opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic," that the stone was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
"According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van conducted his battalion through the channel de San Quentin "through a dense mist and under a strong pink and bulletproof fire from the accomplice."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great boldness" led the soldier forward, self-absorbed by grabbing the gun and beating out three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little over a month later the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, too, had wreathed after the parade, which marked the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great pride he was taking part in the parade," and he added that "the manhood of a real hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
MMA fans waited all night to look at Bellator 206, they got Pepo's lead instead
Imagine you've been sitting there all night watching Bellator 206, and then you're denied access to the main event.
There were 13 battles in the Sanhase program, including six on the main map, and they were on the air all night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the fight, looking in the UK, they just freaked out when the program changed for Pepo.
Some were disappointed after spending their sleepless nights waiting specifically for this fight.
One of the balloons on Twitter called switching to a child's cartoon a "someone's stupid joke."
In answer to a question about Dave Schwartz's broadcast, senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication affairs, he said, "It's by state decree that 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and we had to switch to the children's program."
"Yes, Pig Pep."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program in the future to include British viewers.
"I think we are considering a possibility of repetition, I think we can resolve that issue," said the Coker.
"But now is the sixth morning of Sunday, and we cannot resolve it until Sunday afternoon, and this is Monday after their time.
But we're doing the best we can.
Trust me, if you remember, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We've tried to solve the issue by thinking it's a technical error.
But this turned out to be a state decision.
I can promise you the next time that it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the mass of six to five, as we normally do, this time we wanted to advise the fans, but we're out of time.
It's a beautiful situation."
"Districts of the Free Island": Tom Daley felt "significant" because of sexuality
The Olympics leaped into the water, Tom Daley said it grew with a sense of inferiority to others because of its sexuality -- but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4 in the lead, Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give other people hope.
He also stated that, when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional, traditional Kirsty Young program, back then, took a few months off from being sick.
As a human being on a deserted island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child, he felt smaller than anyone else, because "a society didn't take on those who liked boys and girls."
And he said, "I still think it's a feeling that you're not everything, and it's been something that's given me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint those who had learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal of the alms had become a significant LGBT activist and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year urged countries not to criminalise homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion, because he was fortunate to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time champion of the world said that if you fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, director and producer of Dustin Lance Blacke -- who I met in 2013 -- "it was unexpected to me."
Daley married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said the age difference doesn't matter.
"When you go through that in such a young age," he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said that it was hard to find a peer who would have survived those ups and downs.
In June they became fathers, their son's name is Robert Ray Blackdale, and Daley said his perspectives changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than a gold alpine medal.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son's name is Robert, and his father died in 2011 when he was 40 years old from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics -- he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit down in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what my whole life had been about -- jumping into the water in front of my teammates at the Olympics, that's the best feeling," he said.
This also affected the selection of a song, the Proud of Heather Small, who found a echo in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are running.
"Districts of the Free Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 A.M.
Michelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench reserve in Ryder's cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson on Sunday set the record by playing his 47th match in the Ryder cup, but he has to take the form back so that this event doesn't get miserable.
Michelangelo, who will play in this two-year-old competition, is the record 12th time Jim Führerek, the captain of the team, has planted on the bench the reserve for Saturday Formula Ones.
Instead of being in the middle of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time winner of the cup shared his days between a cheerleader and a coach, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for a hard-core Le Golf National field, where you have to cope with inexorable blows.
And when the field isn't gloomy enough, Michelangelo and Tommy Fleetwood won the four matches this week.
When Americans who stand on four points at the start of 12 single games- -to start with their successes- -Michaelson's match might be extremely important.
The Furik had expressed confidence in that player, but couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped me on the back, knocked me up, and said that tomorrow would be ready," said Furik.
"He's very sure of himself.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a great deal of teams last and this week.
Perhaps I didn't plan it for two games.
I was planning on doing more, but I mean, it was just the way we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be in the field as well as all the others."
Michaelson will beat Nick Fald's record by the number of matches to the Ryder cup played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in Ryder's cup, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
Michelson has 18 winners, 20 losers and seven halves, although Führer said his presence was of use to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humour, and he likes to joke about people, and he's just a very good guy who's good at being on the team," he explained.
'I believe that more young players gladly pare at his jokes, too, this week and that was a good thing to see.'
He gives the command a lot more than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big break may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break before the individual games of the last day at Ryder's teacup can easily disappear.
A Danish player debuted in a 1997 game in Walderem, where a European team led by Sevo Ballesters preferred five points over Americans, but finished with minimal advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that at Walderham we had a great advantage and won, but we had a huge advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," Børn said after watching Class of 2018 win 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and led with a number 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"History tells me and everyone else on the team that it's not the end.
We'll have to play everything tomorrow.
You go out in the field and you do everything right.
Before the points show up in the table, nothing's finished.
And our goal is to try to win this trophy, which is exactly what we're focused on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the best players in the world are on the other side."
pleased with the way his players played the heavy golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
There will be a completely different game tomorrow.
There will be individual games tomorrow, and this is quite different.
It's just great when you're out in the field with a partner and everything's going well, but when you're playing alone, here's checked your true golfer talents.
This is what you have to get to the players and they have to show what's best tomorrow.
Now we've got to leave the partner, the pits have to go and showcase the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his fighter Jim Furik hopes for a better individual game of his own sportsmen than the ones they demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of those matches the last day, playing a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Miracle in Med."
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999 adjusted his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we always want to have a quick start, which you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the speed grows, it turns out that the biggest pressure is on the players who play the match in the middle.
We've got the proper timetable and we've placed the players in a way that we like, you know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic."
Thomas got the job of playing Rory McElroy in the lead game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleet and Jan Paulter will play the top golfers.
"I've put my players in such a row, for I believe I'll close everything," said Bjorn about his choices for individual matches.
Dropping a new German warship again.
The new German Navy frigate had to enter force in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war warships, but it would not appear until next year due to irregular systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The descent of Rheinland-Pfalz, the master ship of the absolutely new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoting the military representative.
The ship was due to enter into force in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after the building prevented this ambitious project.
Four warships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned back in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They'll be armed with strong cannons, different anti-ship and anti-aircraft rockets, as well as with some steals technology, like reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among the other important characteristics, longer periods between maintenance, new frigates can no longer be in their ports for up to two years.
However, continuous delays mean that modern battleships, which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country, are getting old by the time they finally enter force, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate got into headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There are few reasons for return, but the German media has written about many "defects in software and equipment" that make a ship useless in a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of the old Bremen class.
It also turns out that the ship has a very big weight which reduces its productivity and limits its ability to make any further updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons more than the weight of a class of ships that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the missing installation, the whole project, including crew training, is also a problem.
The figure reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), although at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that arise with the new frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, said that the IMF "has fewer and fewer ships capable of war missions."
He stated that the problem would increase in time, because the old ships were listed and the ships were not replaced.
He complained that none of the baden-wuertemberg frigates were capable of joining the IMF.
The national hospice society overheard the secret life of bats
A new study going on in the Scottish Mountains- -is about how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique mammals and to help sustain these animals in the future.
A study by scientists from the National Society of the Monuments of Scotland is done by small bats and also by storms of long-eared bats from Dabanton in the Gardens of Inverja in Western Ross.
Special writing tools will be placed in the main areas of this area, so as to keep track of the bats' actions during the season.
The employees of society and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-to-hand detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all records sets the frequency of calls made by bats as well as those that are saying what they are doing.
The residence card and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, advisor to the National Society for the Conservation of Nature, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help you identify the benefits of creating habitats like meadows and how to support forests for bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and Great Britain has fallen considerably in the last century.
They're threatened by building and developing jobs that affect their place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be risky, just like sticky fly feeds and some chemicals for building materials, and they're threatened with domestic cats.
She's not at all blind.
Yet because of their nightlife the ears are more receptive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They're using complex echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The national society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts working on it, regularly conducting research, testing residences, and sometimes life-saving activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish storyteller bats to be held in Troves in Damfris and Holloway, where there are eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's equity manager says this is the perfect land for bats.
"Here, in Troy, we have just a perfect place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a very good place to stay.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to do for a better life."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before repairing properties, since it was possible to unintentionally destroy one seat by killing up to 400 males and young bats, which would lead to the total destruction of the local population.
Everyone's under guard and it's forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Farrell, a retired bat worker in Scotland, urges the public to help in this area.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many of their populations live."
Ranalda charges with rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German log
Christian Randall called it the charges of raping him with "fake news," saying that people wanted to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German Journal of Der Spiegel, which has published these charges.
The forward of Comptrolling Portugal and Juventus was a charge in the rape of American Catherine Majorgo in a hotel room in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he paid her $375,000 for the silence and he wrote to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In Instagram Live, a 33-year-old Randall addressed 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the indictments were published, calling it "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"Today's news is bad news," said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
"They want to do a commercial in my name.
It's okay.
They want to become known by mentioning my name, but this is part of my work.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Lawyers for Randall are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel on charges that have been called "unmissible reports of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Shertz has stated that a player will seek redress for "moral harm in the amount that matches the difficulty of rights abuses, and in recent years this may be the most serious violation of his rights."
There was an incident taking place in June 2009 in the luxury room of the Palms Howtel and Casinos in Las Vegas.
Meeting at the night club of Randall and Majorgo, it was as if they went back to the football player's room, where he raped her anally, as written in the papers of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Major said that after that he took a stand and said he was "99 percent" -- a good guy -- who suffers from "one percent."
The documents say that Randall admitted that they had sex, but on the side.
The major also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the hospital's injuries, but then agreed to a judicial regulation because she was "very afraid of revenge" and was worried that she would be "publically brought."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to get blamed now, because she's experiencing moral trauma from the experience.
At a time when Randall was about to move on to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and he moved on to Eleventus in Italy this summer, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brixit: Britain's "always will harm" the loss of carbuilders
Britain's "always will be sorry" when it loses its status as world leader of automobile construction after Braxito, stated business minister Greg Clarke.
He added that he was "settled" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain left the EU unagreed, then the company would temporarily cut production in a plant in Bernstone, near Derby's half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said that an impact of a delay on the border as a result of Brexit's unagreed outcome could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernstone, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made, released nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
"In my opinion, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota, Bernstone.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how the cross-border trade would be done when Britain left the EU unagreed. Among them was Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, says it's going to close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Braxito.
The main problem is that carbuilders talk about chain risks as a result of Brexit without negotiation.
Toyota works on the basis of an "exactly in time" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars that are made for orders.
When Britain leaves the EU without agreement on March 29th, there may be disruptions on the border that will lead to delays and gaps in parts.
For Toyota it will be impossible to keep an account in Derby more than a daily reserve of parts, stated the company, so production will stop.
Mr. Clarke stated that the May Plan on Future Relations with the EU was “done in such a way as to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal, we want to get the best agreement that will not only allow us to succeed today, but also allow us to take this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information we're getting not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue working on successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long it would take to fail to produce, but at a future warning that the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsovaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of a trade union, said that members of the union are very concerned: "My question is, once jobs are cut, they will not be restored.
The government press secretary said, "We have proposed a precise plan for our future relations with the EU, which is trustworthy."
The White House declares that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein's assistant could be "scheduled for another week", while the struggle around the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh declared Sunday to the White House representative.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller's special adviser, who is learning how to make elections by Russia, how to relate Trump's assistants to Russia, and how to potentially interfere with justice by the President.
Whether or not to let Trump go of the attorney general's assistant and thus put Mueller's independence at risk, months of pouring oil into the fire of Washington gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering taking a hidden microphone to record a conversation with Trump and that the possibility of removing the president from his post was 25 crucifixes.
Rosenstein turned it over.
But last Monday he went to the White House among the rumors of going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would take place Thursday with Trump, who was at the AAN headquarters in New York City at the time.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at a hearing with the Senate's legal committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh that further delayed the vote in the Senate.
"The Secretaries of the Trumpet Sarah Sanders" appeared on the Fox News Sunday program.
When she was asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "It's a date maybe next week, maybe next week, and I think, rather than a week later, they're taking into account all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I am always giving the very new information."
Some journalists are ready to challenge her statement: Sanders didn't make the briefings for the White House press since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, who runs the programs, asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings was not something to be despised by reporters who work for the public, although he added, "I'll accept the fact that they work for the public."
Then she said that the immediate contact of Trump and the press would increase.
"The President meets more with answers to questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without concrete facts, "we have studied those figures."
The briefings take place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, you've seen us do it for the last few weeks, and these are meetings where you can ask the president a question, and he'll replace the briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings in the street or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York the president demonstrated why, when freely and occasionally extravagantly appeared before reporters.
The minister of health wrote to workers from EU countries about Scotland's health in front of Brexit
The minister of health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health protection system to express their gratitude for the country and to request that they remain after Braxito.
John Freeman sent a letter less than half a hour before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of living for EU citizens who work for the national services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote, "In the summer, discussions continued between the United Kingdom and the EU about the exit of our country, leading up to the expected solutions this fall.
But the British government also contributed to the preparation for the unagreed script.
I know that for all of you this is a very disturbing time.
So I want to remind you how much I value every worker's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
It has colleagues from all over the EU and not only have valuable experiences and skills that enhance and improve health services, but also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie performed a temporary operation after his head injury
A linebacker by the Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie carried out a temporary operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match that his team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Chief coach Tennessee State Road Reed told reporters that the trauma player got injured shortly before he left.
'He's gone to the sideline and he's suddenly fallen,' said Reid.
The coaches and medics gave Abercombi oxygen still in the field before putting it on to the violence and moving it to the diagnosis plant.
Representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there's no more detail about the trauma than that, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when a player gets hurt.
Abercombi, a sportsman's friend, spends the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
But just as he left the game on Saturday, he made five full stops, which gave him only 18 captures per season.
Foreign buyers of the British estate will pay a great deal of tribute
According to a new conservatory plan, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher price, and additional money will go to the homeless
This action will not interfere with Corbin's success in attracting young voters.
Increases in government duties will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Tereza May announce that foreign buyers of British property will pay a higher rate of government tax and that extra money will go to the homeless.
This action is being considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of the Jeremy Corbin initiative by attracting young voters, as well as by providing an affordable shelter. It focuses on people with high income.
The increase in government duties is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to a government-run housing program that is homeless.
The increase in present state demand, including higher levels, taken two years ago, for the purchase of second homes and housing for hire, could be up to three percent.
The finance ministry hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
With 13 percent of the new builders in London buying non-presidents in the UK, that leads to higher prices and it's hard for new buyers to buy their first home.
Many of the country's rich regions -- especially the capital -- have become ghost cities, because most of the consumers from abroad live outside the UK for the most part.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson's call to reduce the state's shipping for young buyers to make it easier to buy a first dwelling.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high prices on the property by taking over the land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to cancel the quotas for affordable housing to fix the "disgusting situation with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including the control of the rent and the cessation of the "nasty" eviction.
He also wants to hand over more authority to the local council in the area of housing construction.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I stated that my dedication to the prime minister's crew is to make the British dream come true. Life for every new generation is to be done better.
That means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives.
However, it's unfair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too many people the dream of having their own house becoming increasingly inaccessible, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish conscription."
"Sanderland coach Jack Ross" said his main ambition was to ever coach a Scottish national.
A 42-year-old Scotsman is doing the task of restoring a club from the northeast, which is now ranked third in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved on to this job last summer after returning Saint-Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
'I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
"But can't," said Ross in a BBC broadcast to Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up, often sick of Scotland at Hampton Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But this will turn out to be an opportunity when I'm a successful club coach."
Ross is one of the predecessors of Sanderland's coaches, Dick Lawyer, David Moys, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poie, and Paula de Kanya.
Former coach, Aloa Atletik, said he had no fear of such famous names in such a large club, rejecting the suggestions from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Now shall I have success in answering the question 'Shall I return this club to the Premier League?'"
With the structure and material base of the club his place must be in the Premier League," he said.
"Not just put it back there, but I'll count my work successful only if I can get it back."
He's only been a coach for three years, he's been a coach's assistant at Dumbarton for 15 months, and he's worked at Harts Training Headquarters for 15 months.
Then he helped Aloa get back from the third league and turned Saint-Mirren into a loser who almost got into the Championships in the next season's winner.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than he does during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkerke, Saint-Miren and Hamilton Academic.
Minding the work at Aloo, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching was what I needed even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I've worked hard, I've earned well, I've achieved certain heights.
But the game may be hard.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still going through this when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and it's the nicest time of all my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview in Sportssound on Saturday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m. in British summertime
It's a good time to have a pint of beer on Saturday.
The hot summer has raised the income of British pubs struggling for survival, but has brought pressure to network restaurants.
According to the statistics of the pubs and bars, sales increased by 2.7 percent in sticky, but in restaurant sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Advisory Business Group, who was collecting this statistic, said, "It takes longer than expected to have sunlight and longer than expected, to participate in the English finals of the World Cup, which means that what happened in July was what happened in June when the pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and that's what the restaurant suffered even more.
The decline in sales in restaurants was 1.8 percent in June- -only worsened in sticky.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they showcase the best results in contrast to restaurants.
The more selling the food the more, the more they got in the sun, though not as strong as the restaurant.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and liquor bars, sales rose by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and placement, said, "These are trends that we have seen since the end of April.
The air and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volume of sales in the public food market.
No wonder restaurants keep on struggling, because sales have fallen by 4.8 percent a year, and that's very unpleasant when prices keep rising.
A long and hot summer has come at a very bad time for operators who focus on food, and it's time to show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief."
The overall sales growth in babies and restaurants, including recently opened ones, fell 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in the spread of brands.
A tool to track sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of nine billion pounds, and is an important orientation in this field.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social media that he hides from his parents
The study showed that one in five children, some of whom had only 11 full, had secret accounts in social media that they were hiding from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed the increase in Faikka Insta pages
It's the news that raised fears that sexual content was being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a main account showing their parents
One out of every five children, some have only 11 full, they create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed the rapid growth of Faicial Instagram ledgers.
This news raises fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had clean accounts to show to their parents and they also had private accounts.
One mother, who happened to find her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found out that she was the one who called out to the others "rape me."
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 percent of teenagers between 11 and 18 had two profiles and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they can't be found by their parents or teachers."
Eilid Doyle is going to be the "sportsman voice" on the Scottish Council of Easy Athletics
Aylid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Athletics as an observer member of the council at a yearly general meeting of that body.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled athlete and Ian Beatty, has described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from it at a wide variety of levels, including the international one over the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect in Scotland, Great Britain and the world's partnership community, and we're confident that an easy athlete in Scotland will get a lot more benefit from her work in the council," said Beat.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of sportsmen, and I hope to help run sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantas Olympics and two other gold medals in the other alimony and who is now an expert at the BBC can't walk after a millionaire's experience.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I suffered a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time to show whether I'm going to go to some degree.
It was a hard job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing the exercise on my life!
Thank you for the message with support!'
The advertisement for a lactating pump where mother compares with cows shared opinion on the Internet
The small pump company shares the opinion that they released an ad that compares feeding women to cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the launch of what they call "the world's first stuffed baby pump," the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian musical ad based on video to show the freedom that this device gives to the nursing mother.
Four real mothers are dancing in a carnage with cows in song, where they're like, "Yes, I'm giving myself, but I don't have a tail," and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And he said, "Dai, dai, I feed children, dai, dai, I give up my women."
However, an advertisement posted on a Facebook page sparked a heated discussion on the Internet.
There were 77,000 views and hundreds of comments -- and the reaction to the video was mixed -- many said it was a horror of small production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must weigh down and give birth to give milk; here are only their children picked up in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's baby pump is not visible in the elvie/Mother
Another comment was, "I understand traumaticly both for the mother and for the child.
But why don't you use them for the advertisement of a baby pump for a mother who doesn't have kids?"
And someone said, "Well, that's an unthinkable advertisement."
They were defending the advertisement, and one woman wrote that they thought it was a funny song.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I had a breast-feeding.
The sucking of milk makes me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a genius product," she wrote.
Another comment was, "A very funny advertisement directed at mothers who suck their milk pump (often at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves as cows."
This ad doesn't applaud or condemn small industry."
At the end of the video a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible baby pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel cowlike.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely silent, has no wires, no pipes, and undetectable hides in an air conditioner for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even leaves the house during the operation of the device.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and law enforcement run.
Because of the parallel between feeding women and young cows, we wanted to pay attention to the suckling of milk and its gravity, while at the same time demonstrating the funny and good-natured way the new small pump would bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
This isn't the first time the Elvie baby pump has been caught in the limelight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in the clothes of Martha Jacobowski, using this product.
Hundreds of child migrants without too much noise will be taken to an on-site camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings a month has almost changed, the number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, partly due to the severe rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration, which have hampered the deployment of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants, who are afraid to put their own lives in danger, taking responsibility for the baby.
The risks were high in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other senior members of households would have to take fingerprints and be given data to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, addressed the Congress with a report on the arrests of dozens of people who had requested to sponsor minors without escort.
It was reported at a later date that 70% of those arrested before were not tried.
"Approximately 80 per cent of those who are sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
"That's why we keep chasing people like that," said Mr. Albans.
For faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules which require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, according to employees' comments, before the standard period of 60 days.
A great deal of people will have to take video connections instead of being in court in person to make their own legal claim.
Those people who don't have a reason to help are rapidly deported.
According to employers of shelters and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in recent months than children remain in prison, the higher the likelihood that depression or anxiety may occur, which may result in violence or flight attempts.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are much stronger because of the signs that the child is in an emergency, they're more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They're adding that a child's transition to a purposeful town without having time for emotional preparation or a greeting from friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already experienced.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of US, France and Turkey's occupation forces
Addressing the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also urged the Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that has been going on in the country of eight years.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the struggle against terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and without making any arrangements," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, the "war on terror is almost over."
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria who basically act as instructors and advisors to the forces of Kurds and Syrian Arabs who stand in opposition to President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent on Earth in this devastated warland is composed of more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muelam stated that conditions for return were favourable and that he accused the "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fears across the country containing refugees from abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their return," he said.
"They politicize the humanitarian issue only."
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be assisted in restoring until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between the Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major resistance of Idliba created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale invasion of Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province inhabited by three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines", and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related fighters from the Nusra front, who would be "destroyed".
Ambassador AN Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first sittings of a new committee, which will include government representatives and opposition members to develop a post-registration constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee by saying that the commission's work should be limited by "review of articles of the current constitution" and a warning against intervention.
Why Trump will go for a second term
This makes sense, Mr. Trump wins the 2020 election -- when, as many liberals hope, the impeachment and scandal of the dayerminously failing to complete his presidency.
And that will doubtless be "The Dramatic Final of the Presidency in all the history!"
At the moment there are no signs of crowd fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings have grown by more than twice, to 1.05 million by CNN and nearly three times, to 1.6 million by MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, while The Rachel Maddow Show screened 3.5 million viewers and overcame cable TV ratings on the evening of news coverage.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand it," said Neil Burr, director of the ABC drama, "The transferee" about a cabinet member who becomes president after the attack that killed the Capitol.
There's another theory in Nell Scwell, the mastic screenwriter for comedy and author of the book A couple of funny details and a few hard truths about breaking into a Hollywood boy's club.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
--Why?' she asked.
He said, "Because he has fun for me," said Miss.
Chaos is precious even by that which may amuse.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the Wi-Fi that comes out of Washington can become as concrete in the future as the Row vs. Wade thing, depending on whether or not the immigrant family can unite and benefit from the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour, a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "not for printing" in the book "Fear", Paul Manofort's $15,000 jacket with an ostrich skin (a garment marked with vanity, as written in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the dramatic descriptions by Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond the simple framework of wanting to be on the case.
I'll, for example, never look at Super Mario the same as before.
"The part of what he's doing makes you feel like you're looking at the reality of the show that he's showing every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, which is about the changing act of Trump and the constant turn of the story.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you can't.
As I spoke to Mr. Fleise this week, behind the windows of his house on the north bank of Kauai there stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not tear himself apart, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood up before the Senate Judicial Chamber, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on a stake.
"I remember the girls when we produced these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Flace.
'I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.'

External cash flows are falling into a fierce pre-election race in the House of Representatives
No wonder the 17th District of Pennsylvania was covered by a monetary downturn due to a change in the boundaries of the Districts of Congress, which is why two candidates take part in the one-stop elections.
The recently decorated Pittsburgh suburbs surrounded by a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conor Lemba, who won his seat in another district on the eve of the previous spring.
Lambo opposes another acting deputy, the republican Keith Rothfuss, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely the same as the new 17th.
The cards were drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January determined that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the republicans.
The re-election race in the new 17th district sparked a drop in company funding by financial groups of major parties, the Committee for the Democratic Company (CRC) Congress and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCRC).
The Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory on a wide-seated ballot in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the 20-point district.
Political experts say there's a small advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. assessed the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support and then stepped down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported the position of Beijing in spite of a slight opposition from Washington, D.C.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Mr. Juan Carlos Warell's president in June 2017 and settled down at a hotel in Panama until the partners moved out the Trump leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call off US diplomatic missions heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan," state Department Secretary Heather Nawert stated earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
Upon completion of the internal meetings, representatives of the North and Central America postponed the holding of a conference at a high level devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would be the continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration into the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the board had come to realize that they wanted the conference to stop actually considering the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pensy is now speaking at a conference in mid-October as a sign that the administration is in favour of holding a event.
And three American envoys without too much noise returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any further severe dispatch or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues under the rule of anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed to others close to the administration of analysts who also want to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, an example of which is currently in the hands of very difficult evidence in public documents.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly paying attention to the possibility of an election between Trump and Russia.
When Congress changes lord, Mr. Trump will face responsibility to that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
There is a lot of "when," and I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like it did in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, must make a choice which determine how long the struggle takes.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for the coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had given him support and resistance to Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed and missed the chance to avoid being killed for the next few years.
History revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Right now the Americans have faced a few of these breakthroughs.
What happens if Mr. Trump is dismissed by the Deputy Attorney General of Rhode Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the paper said that last year he offered to secretly write down the president's words and think about his usefulness.
Mr. Rosenstein says the "The Times" is not correct.
"How shall we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Bret Kavan's case is not allegive or fair, or if it be upheld in the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual violence and unconscionable testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in favour of Congress, which will call Mr. Trump to account?
If we don't pass these trials, long winters will come for democracy.
But I do believe that we're not going to leak it because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who deported to Aspencim the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my house in the past.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light a Shrimp candle on that table with a swastika.
With such an inheritance as I may not be an optimist in respect to our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior academic associate of the Brookings Institute, head of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics organization, with a headquarters in Washington, D.C., and author of the book "Last Palace: The Stormy Age of Europe in Five Lives and a Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the day before the Raped Vienna game.
The Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they will win over the Austrians after a devastating blow in Spain over the William at the beginning of this month, to allow them to safely step out of the G League of Europe group.
The trauma to his knee prevented Graham Dorans from speaking out for the first time in the season before the "Williareal" 2-2, but he thinks Rangers will be able to use that as a tramp.
"It was a big game for us, because Villareal is a strong opponent," thinks 31-year-old football player.
'We started a game, thought we could get something, and made a point.'
Perhaps in the end we could have killed the ball, but on the whole none had also become a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but the second time we pulled ourselves together, and we had the best half of the field.
There will be another significant European football night on Thursday.
I hope we can earn three points, but this will be a tricky game, because they've shown good results in the last game, but given the crowd of teachers on the stands, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was defined as being tough both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying the game; the training is good.
We hope to be able to move forward, to get past the season, and to succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of pensionable accumulations
Despite the fact that poll participants had an accurate idea of what they wanted to look after, few of them talked about it with their families.
About half the people who were involved in the nationwide research said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them but not take steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Association.
That's what we should begin with.
Consider this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you are not in advance to announce your wishes.
Work with a consultant and family and consider where and how to get medical help because this can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Drag a financial consultant into it. He can also help you find a way to pay the bill.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that can help cover these costs or you can self-insect your life -- provided you have the money.
Case solved with legal instruments:
Get medical attention to assign a trusted person to control your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are implemented by specialists if you cannot talk.
In addition, explore the possibility of confidence-building in financial management.
Enter the person who should be trusted to make the financial decisions and to secure your accounts if you are in need.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about the banned medicines and the availability of allergies?
Lock these details in writing to be ready.
"They're not just about financial matters, they're about professionalism," Martin adds.

In Ifracoombe a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man got a few hits from a pneumatic rifle when he went home at night.
The victim, 40 years old, was in the county of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 2:30 local time, as "an accident".
The victim was not seen by the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening; the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
An Earthquake and a Tsunami in Indonesia
According to the official figures, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that fell on the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, and it is expected that the number of deaths will grow.
Owing to the disconnection of communication, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal regency, a region north of Paul, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In the field, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
The Pole is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow cove on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake came, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding.
Dongola is a region that spans more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The government is the administrative unit under the rule of law. There were 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and the rural landscape are fundamental to the economics of the Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Natural Disasters, Paul and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, hundreds of houses were destroyed by the tsunami in Dongola.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic, active Pacific fiery ring and it's regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following list of main earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indian province of Aceh in the north Sutra on December 26th caused the tsunamis that swept 14 countries and resulted in the deaths of 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast in more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes broke down on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March-beginning April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake occurred in the south of Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami on the southern coast of India, which resulted in the death of about 700 people.
2009: There was a 7.6-ball earthquake in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: The 7.5-point earthquake took place on one of the Isles of Mantua outside the Sutra, triggering a ten-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Weak Earthquake fell on the Beneficial of Podzi Jay in the province of Aceh, causing havoc and panic, as he reminded people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and the tsunami.
This time the tsunami didn't come, but more than 100 people were killed under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes have taken place on the tourist island of Lambok Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north.
The earthquake had destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Payne's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence in the family
Track Payne, the eldest son of former Alaskan Governor and Vice President Sarah Payne's candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Palin from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting the information on domestic violence and countering an arrest issued Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to a police report- -when a friend tried to call the police to report an alleged crime- -he picked up a phone for her.
According to a KTOU channel, Payne is in the process of tracking the Matanusk-Sustyn isolation facility at $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "quite innocent," when he was asked whether he would plead guilty, reports the network.
Payne is accused of three Class A felonies and he's threatened with up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He's also being accused of committing Class B crime, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time against Payne have been blamed.
In December 2017, he was accused of being attacked by his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaskan veterans' court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence; forging a report on domestic violence; and for storing an alcoholic weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
An earthquake in Indonesia, tsunamis: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 points triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and it is expected that in the coming days the number of victims will grow.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the capital city of Jakarta, Indonesia.
So social networking videos show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Pal city when the tsunami lay on the shore.
The federal prosecutor's office requires a rare death sentence for a terrorist in New York.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Siful Saipaw, a terrorist in New York City, who has resulted in eight deaths -- a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipas, 30 years old, allegedly took advantage of a truck from Home Depot in October for a bicycle ride along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was hit by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To substantiate the death penalty, according to the announcement of intent to achieve the death penalty imposed on the South District of New York, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipes "witted" eight people and "intentionally" have suffered serious bodily harm.
According to the court's evidence, for both violations there is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal prosecutor is investigating the jury in shock by accusing Saypawa of 22 counts that included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this paragraph is usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases as well as the prosecution of rape and destruction of means of transport.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "old and intentional planning," and in describing the crimes committed by Saipa, they used phrases such as "disgusting, cruel and outraged."
"Sifula Habibulaevich Saipi caused the trauma, caused the damage and caused the loss of family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernán Feruch, Hernan Diego Mendas and Alejandro Damian Paguk," says the note of intent.
The five people who died were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last prosecution of a crime with a death penalty in the South District of New York it has been ten years.
Responsible Khaled Barnes was convicted of the murders of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York on a federal case was imposed in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been punished after they had been sentenced two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union for the benefit of the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple were punished in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipes, an outlaw from Uzbekistan, in accordance with court documents, demonstrated the lack of scruples of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he stated by following that he felt contentment with his action.
According to the indictment, Saipei was told by the government that on the attack he was inspired to watch the video by the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked permission to bring the flag of the Islamic State to the hospital, reported to the police.
He doesn't plead guilty to a 22-point conviction.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipawa, said they were "uncertainly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision on the application of the death penalty, rather than on life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation, will only prolong the pain of these events for all the participants," said Patan.
The Saipa's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to try to get a death sentence.
A member of Parliament from the Torah said that Nigel Faradge should appoint talks for Brexit.
During a protest at the Torah party today, Nigel Farage vowed "to mobilise the people's army."
Former leader Ukip said politicians should "feel uncomfortable" with the Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Parliament, Tereza May, proposed his candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of parliament from Peter Bone's conservatory party said during the Birmingham march that Britain would have "come out" if Mr. Faraz were to be the secretary-general for the Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced in trying to make up for her divided followers was even worse when the Torahs, who are in favour of maintaining EU membership, took a stand against Braxito in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying his best to keep a compromise Cheker agreement under constant pressure from supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels in spite of the negative reaction and they want to force Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between her package and "the mess."
Mr. Bone said at the rally in Salihal that he wanted to "drop the Chucker off the board."
He suggested that Lord Farage make it equal and lay down obligations for the negotiation with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out already," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingboro said, "I'm for Brixit, but we have to get out of the Chucker Plan."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We have not fought the world war to be dependent.
We want to do our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely out of the ordinary."
Brixito's proponent and Thora's member, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chechen plan is unpopular among the general public; the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in our party and activists who are actually coming out and beating us.
Please give up the plan and start listening."
In a quick turn to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime ministers remain on board when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be made to "feel comfortable" when they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us peoples and politicians," he said.
And she said, "They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, "You don't get away with it."
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make our politicians, who are willing to betray Brexita, feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilise the people's army of this country, which has given us a victory in Brussels, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the outsiders made it through Birmingham before having a two-hour rally in the middle of town.
Several activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after starting the group this weekend.
The Labour Pier Lord Adonis was worried about conservators for security reasons they had encountered because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
Such a thing as good Brexit. There is no such thing," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of batting down the president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she "will pay close attention to the process of voting as president."
"The Boston Globe" reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told of her future at a general meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to run for the election, and she's opposed to a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dil, who was the parent of Trump's company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the middle of discussions as a potential Trump rival in 2020.
Since Trump's entry into office it has been the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general assembly, which took place on a Saturday afternoon in Khaliök.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it's time for "a woman to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that it's up to a woman."
Arise took place after the death of a basketball player, Sims, from a team at the University of Louisiana.
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported that a basketball player named WSL Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dean Simpson at a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. in the morning of the beginning of time.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shooting asking if you could help us figure out the person who was sitting on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at on Friday morning at a South University campus.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head as a result of his death," channel journalist Murphy J. Paul said Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot with a Simpson.
In the course of questioning Simpson confessed in that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist an arrest and was taken into custody in the police department of East Baton-Rose County.
6 feet tall, 6 inches tall in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season, 10 of which were on the course from the start, with an average of 17.4 minutes on the course, scored 5.6 points, and scored 2.9 games.
Grand Prix to Russia: Lewis Hamilton drew close to the title of the world champion after he had won the victory over Sebastian Fethel under the inside command.
Since Waltery Botas was on Saturday heading to Louis Hamilton's qualifying set, it's become clear that the instructions within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Boots pulled out a good place on the colt and almost left Hemiltan on the loose of his fate until he defended his place on the first two prowls and invited Fetel to attack his friend on the command.
The feller first went to a pit-stop and left Hemilton to rumble at the end of the total mass of hounds; that is the manoeuvre which was to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit stop later and came out behind the Fetel, but Hemilton stepped forward after several wheel-to-wheel manoeuvres that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space free, risking to hold back after a double manoeuvre to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstapen started off on his 21st birthday from the back of a series of networks and by the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race until he held the rails, because he wanted to quickly finish, overtake Kimi Ryanen and take the fourth place.
As a result, he went down to the pit-stop on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase speed on the rest of the eight circles, so Ryanen took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Waltery had all the weekends spoken fantastically and had expressed himself to be a true gentleman, if I shall be allowed to say so.
"The command did an extraordinary job to take the first and second places," commented Hamilton.
It was a really bad language body
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dean Feinstein at a rally Saturday because she insisted that she did not appear to be the source of the escape of the letter of Christine Blacy Ford, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bret Cavan of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the evidence, the Ford data before the Senate Trial Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate had shown how people could be "disgusting, disgusting and false."
"The only thing that can happen is that it's beautiful what's happening in the Senate in the last few days, it's when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and running away and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It is not me."
Remember?
Diana Fanstein, is that your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document-- "Oh, what?
No, no.
I've had nothing."
Wait a minute.
We took a leak -- no, we didn't let it," he added, in order to help the senator.
Fanstein was sent a letter in July detail explaining the charges Ford had against Kavanaugh and he ran off early in September -- but Fynstein denied what had happened to her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations; I didn't let her story get away," said the science committee, reporting "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep the story private and I granted her a request."
But her denial probably didn't like the President who commented that way during a Saturday rally: "Here's what I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Prolonged for the protection of a candidate in the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see the ugliness, the ugliness, and they don't care who they hurt, who they're going to have to go through to get power and control," -- the words of the President of the Mediaite.
Elite League: Danji Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two juvies for the Giants in a game against Dandi
The Dandy Stars took on the Friday defeat they were hit by the Belfast Giants in the elite league, winning the 5-3 home game on Saturday.
Thanks to the blow that struck Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville Giants... they led on two pucks at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney leveled the number before the Deweyer re-established the Giants leadership.
François Bushar of Dundee got the count straight, and then Lucas Lundwald Nielsen made two noises and a winning team.
It became the third parasite in the elite league during the season for the Adam Keefe team to beat Dundee at 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met four times a season; they had won the Giants in the previous three games.
The first goal of the fourth minute of the match, 03:35, was to kill Deweyer from the Kendal McFol fall, and four minutes later, Baville doubled the number after David Rutherford's fall.
During the first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the number on the part of the landowners, and then Coon aligned the number after Matt Markward's transfer (15:16).
The Deweyer provided the Giants with leadership on their first break, killing their second wave for meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking sides has regrouped, and Bushar has re-balanced the score by killing a shell during the team's numerical superiority (27:37).
Coon and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen bring Dundee out in the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, and he secured a win with the fifth number of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five matches, are playing the last home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller is dying, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
A plane operator in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring a successful flight with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without a word after the big earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday that caused the tsunami.
The strong underground jolts continue, and many people are buried under ruins in the city of Poles.
Though his colleagues were saving themselves from escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the foot of a foothills, which had sailed wildly at the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al-Yufri.
He remained seated until the flight of 6321 Batik Air, which was on the airstrip at that moment, disintegrated from the ground.
Then he jumped out of a dispatching island when he decided that it would break down.
Later he died in a hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia, the investigator's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balipoppan to Kalimantan, which was to carry him to a more violent hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter flew up to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of victims can reach a few thousand, and the agency to reduce the risk of contagion states that access to Dongal, Siggy and Button is limited.
Sutopa Purvo Nugroha, a representative of the agency, said, "Perhaps the number of victims will increase further, as many bodies have still not been able to dig from under the debris."
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Paul, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will auction off humanitarian aid.
Kusumo rice, a 35-year-old mother, reported Sky News: "A fast car brings bodies every minute."
The clean water is low.
Stores are made everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported CNN: "The Indian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who have survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's a tragedy, but anything can get much worse."
Indonesia's President, Jok Vida, arrived in Paul on Sunday and said to the military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?' – reports CNN.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in the Lamboca earthquake in Indonesia.
A plane crash in Micronesia: reported by Air Niugini one person disappeared without news after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight which had made the emergency landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia had previously said that all 47 passengers and a team had safely evacuated from a plane that was sinking and now declares extinction without the news of a single passenger.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that it cannot report on the whereabouts of a single male passenger on Saturday.
The airline reported that she works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; e.g. his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the team after landing the plane on the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, seven people were reported to have been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying in a hospital on Saturday; they were all in good condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unexplained.
According to statements from both the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon, without going to a flight lane.
According to messages from some witnesses, the plane missed a flight runway.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
'That's very good,' said Janes.
In his words he and others were able to climb the belt in the water to the fatal exit of a plane that was already sinking.
He said that the gardeners panicked and began shouting, as well as that he had got a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who rammed near the wharf also helped save by using a puffed-up boat to transport people to shore until the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them have been Air Niugini.
An analyst repeats the event in the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday the indictment concluded with the submission of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of being burned by a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Roulet, has been presenting for several hours as an engaged expert in information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
According to Roulet, "The Clarion Ledger" reported that he had received information about the place from several cell phones which showed that Telis was from Chambers on the evening of her death that contradicted his previous statement.
When the data that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone at the time when, according to him, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were on their way to find Sanford.
Sanford gave evidence Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
If the prosecution asked whether Tellis was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said that he was " lying since my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Tellis' statement that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks after she died.
cell phone records show they've known each other every week.
According to Roulet, some time after Chambers Tellis' death he removed her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He's wiped her out of his life," said Haley.
The side of the defense is to begin disputes of sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio intends to deny this genre a negative look, filling its music with positive installations.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip-hop has moved away from its sources: political statements and passionate questions.
They want to go back to his roots and make his hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Akala and Lowkey have returned to such a group as The Fugees and Common, as are popularity in the United Kingdom.
Another blacklisted?
A nurse from New York falls into court for a married couple for a "racial" post-exclusion message
A woman from New York is tried by a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she was "another black woman."
They say they're racist, and they compare poses to extortion.
In 2016, Lindsay Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two, was disappointed to find that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was blacklisted when she arrived on her first day of work.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Miss Morris a message twice.
Plaska-Flaxman, according to the New York Post error, dismissed Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also African-American, was doing a bad job and that she was waiting for a Filipino.
Miss Morris paid the day of work and sent home for Uber.
Now Morris is going to court for a couple, and he wants compensation for his dismissal on the terms on which she was originally hired, although without a contract: $350 a day for six months.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," she said Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
A pair of defiant accusations of racism, arguing that the dismissal of Morris was a reasonable decision, bearing in mind that they could not trust her after having offended her.
'My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Post husband, Joel Plaska.
"Would you trust your children with whom you have dealt rudely, let alone chance?
His trouble?
Should it be?"
The flat area is equal to the challenge and it says that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation."
'And will you persecute a man in such a state?'
"It's quite tough," added an investment-banking specialist.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned marriage in social networks, subjecting them to strong criticism of their behaviour and logic.
Publishers of Podington were afraid that readers would not control bears that speak, speak, speak in new leaf.
Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote of a letter that said, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the one who reads it the first time before it's published.
It's so interesting to read it, already knowing of the great success of Paddington."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a book for the kids about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted and added that the 60-year edition of the book was "hot-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a very boastful man," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parental pride for a child who had accomplished something: you are proud of them, though it is not really your fault.
I think he was considering the success of the podingutan in this sort of key.
Though it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave it to himself as a subdington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After her daughter's landing she was taken to Nice's Hospital by Louis Pasteur 2 where doctors in vain struggled for her life.
"It was a regular call to tell us that everything was really bad that she couldn't make it," said Mrs. Eden Laperuse.
"Then called me on to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to part with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Dad, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who gave to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and this was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that things had unfolded.
I could neither groan nor cry nor weep, for there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Eden Laperuz, who had lost her daughter, got on a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she was going through.
"No one knows," she said.
'I tilted my head and down my face all the time with tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that caught me feeling sorry for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who mourn cardpoints to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost their dear self-sustainment make sure other people don't take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the hotlines and phone numbers that people can get help with on the Wales Bridge.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he started depressive, and at 18 he ended up in suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I do," she said.
45 year old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Leeds, said that her son was a gifted chef with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job, for he was in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
And Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Mrs. Davis made cards, "that people knew there were people in the world that you could go to and talk to even if it was a friend.
Don't stay quiet; you have to talk."
Mrs. Hasfris, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was sad or that he was depressed or anything like that," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On a holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened presents he did not even look at them."
She said his death was for their great trauma, but had to live with it: 'The family has got a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep living and fight."

Being Breta Cavanaugh is not sure because the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- limited in time and time in the scope of the investigation -- we could get a little union," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was breaking down because it was actually in traffic.
Why doesn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is sometimes explained.
Interoperable elections in just five weeks, six November -- if Republicans are expected to suffer from a stroke -- will be weakened in their attempts to elect a candidate for the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senator to elaborate on the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then working as a private secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
I haven't realized yet whether or not Mr. Kavanaugh will get 50 votes in a vote in the Senate to allow Vice-President Mike Penz to resolve the issue of voice equality and to uphold it with the Supreme Court.
The number of runners from North Korea has fallen in Kim's direction
The number of fugitives from North Korea to South has fallen since Kim Chen Ying seven years ago, according to a South Korean official.
Park Bo Sun, bringing the data of the South Korean Ministry of Mergement, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, and there were 2706 last year.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons were the enhanced border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers had set.
--Phanyan didn't comment on that.
Most of the runners from the north with a reason why they get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them run through China, with which in North Korea the longest limit, and it's more easily crossed than the Demilitarized Zone (DPZ) between the two Koreans, which is very highly guarded.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often makes them repatriate.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan for negotiations concerning denuculation.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Chen-yun in June in Singapore when they agreed on common working hours with the goal of fully freeing the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ry Ian Ho, accused the American sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we are not going to disarm first," said Mr. Ree in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Breta Cavanaugh a "striker," she said he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
A minority leader in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelozy called a candidate in the Supreme Court of Breta Cavanaugh a "steric," and said that, at its pace, he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman were acting like that, they'd call her an "sterician," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
The coffee emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech Cavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he even shouted and couldn't talk when his family and the senior classes of the school were discussed.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats on the committee of accusing him of being "a citizen and organised murderer," organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he thought Cavanaugh's statement showed he couldn't work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against the Democrats.
"I believe he has disqualified himself with his statements and with the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to impeach Cavanaugh if he was chosen and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way -- if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or the FBI, he doesn't only have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelozy.
At the moment, Cavanaugh is the judge of the Columbia District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavono's potential decisions against the law on affordable medicine or the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Cavanaugh was considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings on the Kavanaugh crew, he did not answer questions as to whether he would call off certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, objective persons to work in a court of law and to expect us to say 'How wonderful'," said Pelozy.
And a woman must have this ability.
This justified accusation speech, months and years of anger just overflows, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years ago.
I don't think that's so rare."
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who worked for the director somewhere, and she said, when she got caught up, she cried, but she developed behavior techniques, and when she got angry and started crying, she said, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And she just kept talking.
I believe it was wonderful."
Tears are allowed partly as a result of summation, for they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first job I once cried out of unspeakable anger, and an elderly woman -- a restrained principal -- grabbed me for the collar, who always scared me a little bit -- dragged me to the east.
"Never let them see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that thee is sad and will be glad that brought thee."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman Democrat from Colorado, worked with Harry Hart in a presidential campaign at the time.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got caught up in a marriage treachery on a yacht called Monkey Business and stepped out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder thought that she herself could take part in a presidential campaign.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision," laughing she told me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates, and they didn't need me at all.
Someone called this a "Blesser and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been going on for quite some time now, she didn't have enough money, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a misstep.
It turns out that some of her supporters, who sacrificed $1,000 to men, only gave her 250 dollars.
"They think I'm going with the discount?" she thought.
When she made the statement that she would not participate in the campaign, she was so deeply engrossed in emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, the anger at the system that made it so difficult for her to get money and go after voters, not candidates, and the anger at sexism -- that she caught her breath.
"You might think that I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder in response to the press report on her condition.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of Kleenex paper serviettes.
I used to think that they would write on my tombstones?
"She cried"?
Why the trade war between China and the United States may be good for Beijing
The first traffic jams between China and the United States were deafening, and since the war was far from over, in the farthest possible misunderstandings between the countries might be in favour of Beijing, experts say.
The President of the United States of America shot first warning at the beginning of this year with data from China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs hit 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) in total, with half of the United States' taxes on goods coming from China.
Beijing responded in this way every time, raising prices recently from five to ten percent for American goods at 60 billion dollars.
China is a symmetrical answer to the United States, and the second largest economy is hardly going to lead.
To get Washington to stand down, you have to dig deeper into the demand, but the public bias towards the US is practically unacceptable to the Chinese leader Si China.
But experts say that if Beijing is using the situation correctly, the US trade war on the far side can support China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions behind the rapid economic downturn process is much more dangerous than the observers thought it would be before," said Abigail Grace, assistant researcher in Asia, in a research-analytical centre of new American security.
Serbia's "ready" to return refugees, said the foreign minister
Syria states that it is ready to return the refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country torn down by war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muelem stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in the country is more stable and secure today, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas torn down by terrorists to get back to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning the refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of the terrorism and economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
AN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six more million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help in rebuilding a destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept help in exchange for certain conditions or for assistance from countries that had sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Cup of Ryder by beating the American team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the Paris suburbs of France.
The United States has lost the order six times in a row in a European land, and they haven't won a Rydar cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team gained 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who most likely competed in the tournament, drove his ball into the water for the 3rd pair of 16 holes, yielding this match to the Frenchman's robin.
Malinary, an Italian golfer, played beautifully on all rounds, having become one of the four players who passed this field with a number of 5-0-0 since the beginning of the 1979 tournament.
American Jordan Schps was shot down with the number 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating on the European team, Thornbourne Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 and 1 Ian Paulter to England, who may have played in his last box of Ryder.
A veteran of eight Cups of Ryder's Spanish, Sergio Garcia, has become a player who has more than anything won a tournament with a career number of 25.5 points.
"Of course I'm not crying, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to return the cup.
The whole team is, and I'm glad I could help," said raised Garcia after winning the European team.
He handed the estephet to his cousin John Ram, who had re-enacted the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods in a two-and-a-half match on Sunday.
"I am very proud to have won Tiger Woods, a man whose career he had since childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now he has the record number 13-21-3 in the Ryder cup.
This amazing statistic by one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and stands out only on this watch from Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with each other except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who had been playing throughout the whole tournament with a fine golf course.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of those guys, they're fighters.
We have shown Europe what we can do this morning.
We were in a fight.
Take off your hat in honor of Thomas.
He is the great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been played."
