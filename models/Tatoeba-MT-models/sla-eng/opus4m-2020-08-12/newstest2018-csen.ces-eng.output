The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Colorful People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP Travel Recommendation for Missouri, effective 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention to the travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the state,’ the association said.
NAACP stated that it had taken this step on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which made it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before the courts, as well as the conduct of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings which are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, are attacked or killed," said the president of NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel to Kansas City Star.
"We are still getting the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organisation to the US State.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated accusations directed against black-skin students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black-skinned man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dispute at the beginning of this year after he had run out of gas while travelling across the country and the police put him in custody without being charged with committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also points to a recent statement by the state's highest representative, Missouri, stating that black-skin drivers have a 75 % higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should take money with them for a possible payment of bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI's hate crimes programme, in 2015 there were hundreds of hateful cases in Missouri, which is the 16th place among all countries.
At the same time, the Road Alert is a response to the new Missouri Act, which makes it easier to sue the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law allowing State agents to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which, according to the ACLU, aims to improve racial prevention.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but in recent times the legal groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family isn't at peace after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model was murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant where she worked, and he planted stab wounds on her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
Then the killer sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough criminal work search of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The only thing he admitted in court was a juvenile assault, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"Even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he lied.
The girl was supposed to defend herself according to his statement, whatever she could do, but it's not worth it.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his zeal and his taste for a girl.
When he had sex with her, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, and he said it to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and handed her his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," reported the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither supremacy nor conservative," says Martin Raj, who operates the Prague boutique Intimita.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Maresh.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Raj and his friends went on a cycle after Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of seemingly unimaginable vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a companion left so that he could pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in the Prague Benedict Street, the Intimita boutique sells erotic aids in the way that luxury purses or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't he?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, that's what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by the renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the boutique Intimita.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No hidden exhibitions, everything made in a beautiful, deciduous style, products exhibited more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelka, began to consider how to understand Prague’s trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimita's name appealed to both of us.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it is also, you can say, gentle," she says.
Following was the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for an appropriate space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, the option won, which spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and bedroom, which led the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpán from FormaFatal.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect to us because he wasn't on the main street, but again, he was sitting by the name of Intimita.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is snooping around," Martin Raž praises himself.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they've even entered such a store.
When I entered the Intimita boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like going to the erotic aid store.
Right by the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only a woman's service in the store, just so that women don't hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's foot won't come here.
Most men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men don't usually know how to estimate the right size and choose a bigger one," Martin smiles at a common mistake.
Those are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some big help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses perhaps a unnecessaryly large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer mostly black underwear, where women tend to tend to pink.
The absolute best seller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need for me to be quick to admire the seriousness with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it's not embarrassing.
And it doesn't actually grow cold.
It's at a good price and it has perfect user references.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's some recent revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a We-Vibe steam vibrator.
He's completely demolished a taboo that some men can endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"There are different variants," he continues.
One engine, two engines, remote control.
It's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of adhesion vibrators.
At least it's at our place.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, although perhaps they only use them externally.
In Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is the masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses heavily on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It's what's causing me to wonder.
I thought Japanese women would suffer a lot on erotic aids, I object.
"That's the reality of the Internet," I'm told.
It's completely different the other day.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women using them.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the boutique of Intimity, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not in any way supremacy.
On the contrary, we are a kind nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical customer of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "has some experience but also with sexual life, as well as with some aids.
He will come for something nice, more quality, to complement his partner's life, or for himself." Martin Raž and his business partner Zdeněk Shebelka make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specialty types of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it doesn't fit in here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who always had a hot date at the sex shop because they were afraid they'd get caught up in something like this.
A lot of products on shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even received design prices, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first prized was the mentioned sea horse 'and it triggered a change in the whole sector.
It began to slip away from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with healthy ones, different designs, different colors began to be produced...
It is nice to see that the design of some is behind the Czech Republic, and the popular designer Anna Mareshová.
I have to say, I'm quite surprised how many people buy the design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Maresh, although they're relatively expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus balls from Anna Maresh.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made for us.
I wanted to have the production process under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, it's a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may be going a little against the current, but it seems important to keep the developments with us in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything anymore," Anna tells me later, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
It does not encounter a negative or a negative attitude.
They say that people are desperate.
"But then you too will start to smile." Currently Anna Maresh has a vibrator in her offer, on which you can get a personal message, and this year she also plans her own lubricating gel.
In the following year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The limits of healthy sex
I wonder where the limit of what's fine lies.
Is there anything Martin Raj wouldn't be selling anymore?
It's very difficult to define.
What happens to one is normal, the other may seem completely abnormal, so we prefer to define ourselves as a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are allowed into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a final question: What was the most insane demand they had?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking for a masturbation aid for a friend of hers with a naturality of 20 centimeters long.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is, did anyone make fun of us?" Martin's looking at me with a suspicious glance.
And it happens from time to time...
Morning for Carl Gott.
After two cancers, Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Stedry is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gotta's best friend is fighting a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it is true," the singer himself confirmed the sad news to Lightning.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I'm handling it quite well.
"I'm taking medications that have accompanying symptoms of illness to slow down," he added, adding that he thanks the close support.
The whole extended family has grown to make Carl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as possible, with her father in the White Mountain house, and the daughters of Zuzan and Teresa's first marriage, Carel's son, Charles, is taking care of.
Generous man twice fought cancer and shared his experience with Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's got 60 chemos behind him.
He was able to get back to work on tennis court and ski slopes after them.
"From the astrologer I'm supposed to be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The same disease is now being fought in the institution by actress Flowera Fialová.
Do you have a patient in your family with Alzheimer's?
Look how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will judge the US.
In Chile so far, there is an absolute ban on the artificial cessation of pregnancy and therefore it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I hate that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and in late August it should get a new president, who according to the AFP is close to the opposition.
The Act, which violates the absolute prohibition of interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The rightful opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
Members of the vote on the draft law postponed it last month until it was examined by the Mixed Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the MEPs approved the proposal and reopened the Senate.
Under the new legislation, there should be no criminal abortion in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, even before women were granted election rights in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet only a few months before he left the office of president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interference.
The following are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador there are now about 20 women who spend up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now Statue of Liberty
The unfailing sign of regime change is the criticism of the statue.
The Americans could talk about it as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue on the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what he was leaning towards when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of Presidential proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It's worth adding that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
He'd be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
However, he attacked its significance, particularly the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the platform, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller reproved Acosta by saying: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the base in addition, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he put it, it's not history.
This is especially the shocking words of Emma Lazarus, who are resonating today - he invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let him come to me, who is falling, who is poor, who is free to breathe, who can hardly breathe, who is poor in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these “poor worms ” on our screens than ever before.
Miller wasn't trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to explain that these people aren't welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of sculpture is part of a major political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death tried to plant a plaque with a poem on the base of a statue, knew quite well that she was playing a high-level political game.
The statue was to express the connection between the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, a woman is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of the Outcasts.
The combination of poetry with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing adherents have long sought to reverse this meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptistel in Trump’s entry into power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's amazingly coming across an important thing.
The importance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the perspective of a exhausted and cursed traveler who often comes across the ocean after a long and frightening voyage with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a world view with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this standpoint, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't recognize.
Their torches are not supposed to illuminate the path, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise to Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the athletic federation of the United Kingdom Neil Black said that a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Cup team would be “a huge contribution to the team. ”
For MS in London 2017, starting Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes were selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “something special is happening ” and British athletics could learn from the Scots with ice cream.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People in the streets think that too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected the team captain.
‘Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The anguish and unconcealed feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepealable."
A silver medalist from the Commonwealth, who will compete across obstacles at 400 m on her fifth World Cup, said that it is “incredible” that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the last year alone, runner Muir has set five British and two European records.
The MS will take part in a 1500 m and 5000 m run.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track. This season he won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain led her to be “very proud ” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had joined the team, but in many cases they would also attack the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure," she added.
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
It proves where we've moved to.
They're athletes who'll think about the front seats on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I only pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on the home floor.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not apply for public office unless you are critical of voters
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the press to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not keep him cold.
But he didn't try to shut up critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “Freedom of speech may be taken away from us — and foolish and mute we will be led as sheep for slaughter. ”
That brings me to Maryland as Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for these acts.
The governor's employees rejected the suit as unfounded and many opinions on the Internet “who cares” appeared.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
It still matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not eager.
As can be seen, his country is governed with confidence by its own and strictly adheres to principles.
It also turns out that it is reverse in using Facebook as the main means of communicating with its voters - except for the publication of the first photo with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's daily spokesman, Amelia Chase, defended the governor by blocking the comments from a position of moderation of contributions.
However, using images of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post has confessed to a number of real people who have been erased from their contributions.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As everyone put it, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, M.D., questioned hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed with his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," the Washington Post daily comment section said.
"I don't like the idea that once a number of people comment on the same topic, some people are referred to as promoting a so-called collective effort instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called "defendance".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage the posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of workers to the streets where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticised for embarrassing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
According to District Judge James C. Cacheris, President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first supplement in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also welcomed visits from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington, D.C., the price of mail was practically the same as that of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press doubled fourfold and its position as leader questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as “Juriola”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Portius”, wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by people within the framework of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain were collected in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie at the very heart of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data than at home abroad.
In the Czech Republic, they consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most of the time they are moving in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season is led by Croatia.
On vacation, however, they have more time to skew on the website, and under the sun, they are mostly unable to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
It comes from O2's fresh statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available in the framework of a flat-rate than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of ours rides during the winter, data consumption increased even 50 times this summer’s season.
In the second place, Italy was placed in the ladder of data consumed.
Most minutes Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go on work during the summer.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Offices, visits 800,000 Czechs annually, is our most popular holiday destination.
People here, however, exchanged a book for sharing experiences by using a mobile phone.
The record was this year's July 7th.
"There would be dozens of millions of photographs in the transferred data," said the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia keeps data in volume, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
We go to Austria on foot tourism and active vacations, on which we do not have that much time for online skating.
"Moreover, Austria is heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the operator recorded high annual growth in data after roaming charges were released, the increase in phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes called for in roaming increased compared to last year's double.
Germany dominates with a huge head start in front of other countries.
"The calls in roaming are used rather by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar said.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in a domestic atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golf team Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days in a comfortable atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, has submitted to Paul Eales. This year he will serve as the ambassador of the tournament in representing the club's founder and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to fall in love with the quality of the course.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It makes me feel good," said a Southport golfer.
“I had no opportunity to defend my victory at Extremedura Open, because the year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the end of this year, returns to his home land.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on the home floor," Orr said about Hellensburg.
“You want to be successful and feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really glad I played it again, and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The three players will also be joined by former Masters Ian Woosnam winners and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former captain of Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmoire and Ross Drummond.
The entrance to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a cooker.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In its wooden cottage, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali, in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually throws sweet potatoes - in the language of local “notes” - directly into the fire.
After half an hour of potatoes he takes out and enjoys it with his hands unwashed.
Bardine sits on a muddy country - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also does his daily work, such as washing laundry in mud water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is supplanting the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned a field to work on.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late-night hours poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, there are soldiers in the village.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock no one will be allowed to wander around the village," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public show of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current protesting movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city, where you can reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach burning with a ride.
The public transport in this place doesn't work.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty paint.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," Bardin says, pointing to his colorful, hand-stretched turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to carry only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and the local child mortality rate is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of American Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport won gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports timber production at an estimated value of $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army for the Papuans.
The investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Massacres in the district of Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission stated.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the report of the 2016 Brisbane Arcidice, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report is particularly popular rape and execution of electric current - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has been burdened by the fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans,” explains four-twenty-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - Mom-mama (women) - have lost their jobs."
President Yoko Widodo of Indonesia, who is called Joko, promised in 2014 a solution to inequality and rights violations as part of his presidential campaign.
The former carpenter also secured his journey to the Presidential Palace in the capacity of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua New Guinea, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would hear our call for justice," you said.
The fact is, just two months after Jacob’s October inauguration, Paniai suffered a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at Enarotali campfire, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the shera of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was identified by this exclamation point and tone, and later he returned with four other soldiers, by the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a hurry chased a group of children and beat them with guns, reported victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things were still coming out.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ritual hunting bows and performed a dance of waita - where they run in circles and the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago is imitated.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered to radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot”, according to the TIME weekly in an official document, whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the threatening danger and urged the residents to move into their homes.
But no one cared about his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” said Time weekly on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the present soldiers.
"There were a lot of people all around and a lot of shootings were fired," he added.
According to one of the locals, Alfius Youw, his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was hit three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” said Time, a weekly with a gloomy voice, Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan Police Inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “sustaining” the station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said the press spokesman of the Papuan Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protestors were killed and many suffered injuries.
The report on the murders asked the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Joko gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims ’ families and promised to deal with violence in Papua New Guinea.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to occur.
“The majority of violent acts have occurred long ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
However, in a June 5th interview for the weekly TIM, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to take any action in Papua New Guinea.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought to justice. ”
Wiranto, charged by the United Nations with “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 human rights violations have been resolved so far in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his allegations with mistrust.
"In the last three years, I have been asked four times, but so far I have not expected anything," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting still doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
There was a conflict in which one person and another 17 were injured, between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to assist in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravinus Dow (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the stones, and the answers were a warning shot.
Local residents, however, claim that the mobile brigade (the Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central heights.
Many joined the movement for the liberation of Papua New Guinea (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all of this under the condition of “assuring national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never see again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
The oil pours poverty into the fire.
That little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
The locals are growing their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields, each working four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is designed for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire opened more routes and new immigrants have started to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequalities between the native Papuans and immigrants.
As few jobs as possible usually occupy more educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capital and education needed to engage in business.
"Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of work opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists — Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp — were expelled from the country because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities, ” all despite the fact that they received such a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Joko in his election campaign to lift strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"External journalists working in the insurmountable eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa non-recognition and blacklisted," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands — were storming the United Nations Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread violent acts ” in Papua New Guinea, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, shook the charges when he told reporters in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia the democratic system is still valid and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for foreign governments.
When official delegations from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people called according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom”.
Further elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not vote Joko.
“Joki is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Joko to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - except that they live in constant fear of the looting army - are rolling in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, view their voice as “a debt ” that must be repaid to Joki.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of victims of the Panamanian shootings continue in the latest symbolic act of resistance: burying the victims' bodies on the ground across from the police and military stations.
With the knowledge that justice will never be done for enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held a $1.46 tons of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
The attack involved the arrest of a four-man ship crew, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
A yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was taken by police after being arrested to a port in Nouméa, the French overseas metropolis of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where they were headed and where they were headed, and to expose the "Lithuania Union".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs heading to Australia," said her executive director, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive target for its smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing a problem of growing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current takeover is not the first one lately.
Last month, three men were accused of carrying large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle through the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of their drinking.
The problem may be in senior homes, a solution according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlové could be infusion of a physiological solution that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're only applied in medical facilities so far.
The older a person is, the more water he loses in his body.
"In addition, he loses his thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate themselves very quickly," Mádlova said.
They should drink two liters for sure.
"But getting into an old man of so many fluids is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, it is often said that no doctor watches.
In hospitals, dehydration usually resolves by infusion.
"I think that there should be a gradual introduction so that they can receive subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to her, up to two gallons of saline can be delivered to old people in one day.
Lack of fluids may cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he speaks confusedly," she added.
In case of neglect, it may ejaculate until a brain event.
The blood thickens and seals the body in the brain, and the kidney failure is also threatened.
Lying patients should not be covered with feathers, maximum cotton sheet.
One-time prey may also be a problem.
"It is more difficult to care for, but it would be ideal for the patient to be found sometimes and let his skin wind up," the doctor said.
In Dubai, the second skyscraper of The Torch was on fire
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was on fire on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all the inhabitants 337 meters tall and 79 floors tall.
In the last two years, it has already been the second fire of this tall building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the residents of the building were evacuated and no injuries occurred.
“We slept and were awakened by an alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
Dubai's civil defence reported that firefighters managed to get fire under control around 4 a.m. (00:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they provide alternative accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to cover high-rise buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation that started the operation of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, the most damaged was the coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
The British police said that the isolation and siege system of the London Greenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States is carrying prohibited objects on board the aircraft
A passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unwittingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. Government Agency's control post Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found that they were late travelling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1,000 respondents responded - it was found that there was a greater likelihood of infringement of the rules in younger passengers.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had tried knowingly to travel with the object banned by TSA, 19.7 percent of the passengers with several thousand hours of flight were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common objects that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through the guard, while 2.2 percent of the women questioned and 3.7 percent of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately carried the illicit drugs on board.
The company stated that it had conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them had accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport control and how much it had done so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized objects - whether knowingly or unconsciously - travel very often by plane.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of fluid they can carry to the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that the TSA has seized the most of the fluids that have been banned.
For a time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
Overriding of liquids is allowed in domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned directives to reduce emissions of Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's former administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt presented changes in his plan, reacting more freshly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This refers to the last date set on 1 October when States should start implementing the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who served as president of the EPA President Donald Trump for a long time as Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, served as a reliable resistor of more stringent environmental regulations before being appointed head of the EPA.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden centre turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal court of appeal in Washington decided that the EPA contractor had exceeded its authority in order to postpone the integration of Obama's administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperate with States through comprehensive processes and the implementation of new standards within the given time frame.
"For the governments of the previous EPA administration, it often did not meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, in agreement with the settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen complaints against the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of a court dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our statute and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt can use at a certain point “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authority” to ensure that the regulation “will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader copy of the ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month shall seek to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"The reversal in the opinion of the EPA - following our court over - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and D.C. joined New York.
Ground-level ozone occurs when conventional harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are hailing Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is disturbing how much pressure needs to be exerted to change the thinking of the responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological pull of Trump's administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests."
He poured acid on a man, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the other you're suddenly going to change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was encountered by Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was glued to the acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted of guilt.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros' house.
Andreas got up to open it.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he'd never seen in his life, immediately after opening without warning, he poured acid on him, saying, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I felt just incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but there his relatives learned a terrible report - according to doctors he had no chance of survival.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Of the 90 percent, the face the doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body was hit.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever had.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his distress.
Today, Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
Injury that affects the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have scarred tissues for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people will not recover and fight for life against deformation and corruption," said Professor Peter Dzewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
Because the perpetrator believed that he was revenged by a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the entire case properly and subsequently investigated the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
Later, however, Christopheros ’ family’s judgment changed dramatically.
"The three judges eventually concluded that the punishment should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of attacks by the corrosive agents has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed itself on the issue by planning to provide new guidelines to state representatives on the classification of cranes.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer sentences of deprivation of liberty on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tight checks on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different shops, as these are various cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned in the night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the population of the 80-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the speaker, the Dubai police fired a fire on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
According to another tenant quoted by Reuters, fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot wreckage.
We were asleep.
We were alarmed, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said ten-minute tenner George.
Another witness for CNN estimates that the flames captured about 40 flats.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to a civil defense report, the fire was able to get under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, for the inhabitants were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352m tallest residential building in the world.
The following year, another Dubai skyscraper lost him to a record.
The culturist had in his body incredible 14 doping substances.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a wide range of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to medicines for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia - were present in a sample of Ippolita, a three-twenty-year-old.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with his title, he ended up fourth.
Now, a four-year distance and prosecution threatens the bodybuilder.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian football player David Vasta was tested positively for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record number for caught athletes.
A three-year-old player began to take steroids a year ago when he lost his bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-lover!
Only Lucka Vondráčková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, in one round.
And he'll get attention wherever he comes in.
Last time her ex-lover Michal Long, who lived with her for three years, fell into her arms.
At the time, the actor was 12 years older and had longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19, and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they left each other, but friends stayed until today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Coincidentally, they were both in blue.
At first, they didn't look at each other, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes when she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged each other, and the photographers were willing to pose.
However, their encounters were not a coincidence, for they will play together a romantic couple in the new Primey Captain Exner series.
The Islamists were given life in the United Kingdom for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic cell to prison for life, who called herself the Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecution planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, a knife with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelievers" and a model of a gun.
This happened at the time the MI5 Secret Service agent put a listening device in the vehicle.
"Recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they hadn't been stopped," said Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convictions of 28, 25 and 33 years of age may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, men said they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then he rejected the defendant's claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38,3 °C in Hodonínsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the peak for only two days.
At 38,3 degrees Fahrenheit [38,3 ° C], recorded in the Watch Tower of Hodonínsk, he was overcome by Thursday, which thus far became the warmest day of the year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Against Tuesday, however, not many temperature records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, record records for 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years were exceeded or levelled.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in The Watchtower, Thursday’s temperature was the same as that of the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsk, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum of four tenths of a degree, and in Pogorlice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Watch Tower, were from 2013.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watchtower, the largest heat in Dyjakovice was in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj in Břeclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not prevail.
On the contrary, for example, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, according to the ČHMÚ web site, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The heat started to grow there until now later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will be heard gradually according to ČHMÚ and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to apply its influence without using force.
Every year he spends $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, push his entertainment industry into foreign markets and try to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing can't do that.
The local state media is talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of visitors increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of tourists in China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is due, inter alia, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome a foreigner with an open arms, evaluates the situation in the world's most populous country of economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a visa-free relationship with China, citizens of the rest have to settle their visa with advance.
Thus, at the Chinese authorities in the United States, the crowds are comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in the front, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits dropped by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the Federal Central Bank of America, China was able to leave China as a result of China’s foreign travels up to $190 billion, while China received about $35 billion annually in currency sales to visitors.
According to the official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, are inflicting a very painful wound on a country that is anxiously preventing the flow of capital.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived in China.
Some cities have more in the United States.
Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific works show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find them.
Addressing these problems will be politically challenging, but the step being taken is to simplify the visa machine.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently been making great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plzeň Zoo they multiplied deadlyly poisonous reptiles.
The Plzeň Kingdom of Poison can look forward to three rare, deadly reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors see only nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"The lengths of the meter are also growing," said zoo speaker Martin Vobruba.
The cubs of the other two species, the mortals and the cobras of the red, will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
There were eight snake deaths in Australia, eight of which are descendants of a breeding couple from a population in the vicinity of Sydney.
"The only person visitors can see in the exhibition is the mortals from around Perth," said Vobruba, with the fact that in human care it is necessary for mortals to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a snag of African swimming cobras of red.
A couple in the Plzeň Zoo hatched four young eggs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobrub.
This species in the nature of its victim is injecting poison, up to four meters away.
He's aiming for the eyes. He can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species live in the zoo with the mouse nudity.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect hatchlings from the mamba black sleigh, eggs stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone call, Trump is pushing Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The U.S. daily Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27th telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peña, he was urged by Trump to stop publicly reporting that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The president of the United States resented the public’s condemnation of the construction of the wall, saying: “You can’t talk like this in the press. ”
Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also avoided a transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the agreement to oversee the US over refugees heading for Australia was "funny" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which had entered into President Obama's reign - it would look like "druged" after he had proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day. ”
Tusk was testifying again in the D.A. for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said the dead president's brother, Prime Minister of the Government's Law and Justice, PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and read to the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On his departure from the D.A.'s headquarters, he waited for Tusk on TVN 24 mobs, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not frighten me."
According to the prosecutors, there is nothing to blame, but there is no doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against rivals, opposition or people who do not like it, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
It was the second time he was interviewed.
The expo was interrogated in the prosecution for the second time, this time it was meant to address doubts about the victims' deaths in the tar disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were replaced.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there must have been some reason.
And the reason they were afraid of the scandal was because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should have helped Donald Tusk become someone very important in the EU," said Kaczyński on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that any conflict with Russia would rob Tusk of the chance to gain the most important chair in the Union, but Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could be affected differently, but she did not take note.
Tusk submitted an eight-hour hearing with the D.A. on April 19th.
He didn't even testify as a suspect at the time, just as a witness.
However, many of his appeals for questioning were seen as part of the apparent efforts of the Polish government and the chief of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office in Poland is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who acts as Attorney-General.
The call for questioning followed the election of Tusk by the head of the European Council, to whom Kaczynski tried hard but in vain to prevent, inter alia, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová finally protested alone.
In this case, also Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on the barbers.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Barma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It's coming from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots to a foreigner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update, which is currently under review.
Four years ago, ten thousand Czech citizens were elected abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the 2013 decree there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices have been created, some authorities have been closed down, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the material said.
The statement shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall indicate the representative offices to which the ballot papers are to be supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
It's their list that's changing.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both ambassadors are closed.
The Czech Republic also withdrew its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
He won't even vote at the general consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
New are on the list of the Embassy in Kenya's Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and Zambia's Lusace.
In Asia, Czech Republic has since the last parliamentary elections extended its representation to the General Consulate in Iraq's Irbil and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-Čchuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech Embassy in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad have been able to elect members in the electoral rooms at the representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine the region for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when it was decided between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013 the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
About 3,800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
Early parliamentary elections four years ago were reached by the 10,571 electorates.
A massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: activists recalled racist lynching
Ford Mercury, 1948, drove around the watching people of Monroe, Georgia, and coded towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a car with four black - skind passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns had covered the road.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - dragged long from a cigarette and looked at the front window of the car.
Inside, travelers trembled with fear.
"We want this n-and Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence will break the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws his neck over Roger's butt, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford Bridge has been regularly returned by a group of activists who are reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
“It is surprising that in all these years the only person has not been arrested — even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to reorganise the event, has heard.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the execution. Every year, the Monroe community recalls that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers on July 27, 1946 one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI files received by NBC News, lynching was to be attended by up to 50 Monroe men and surrounding districts.
But no one's ever been prosecuted before.
Although suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights adherents claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's inhabitants.
In April 1946, on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court, the black-skin residents of the State of Georgia received for the first time the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, the black-skin farmer Roger Malcom had during the fight to stab the owners of the white-skin property of Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was living with Malcolm’s wife, Dorothy, and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the then significant owner of the land of the white-skinned Loy Harrison bail for Malcolm's $600 bail.
Dorothy and Cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey escorted him to the prison.
On the way back from the prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects were on their way.
"As it turned out, he planned the murders and organised Harrison," the FBI said.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law-keepers who not only took part in the lynching, but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks made a brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black skin: 'this is how you will get if you register and go to vote."
Each year's reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Her performance is graphic, seductive and prestigious, showing deep-rooted racism, which many would like to view as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy and it's even harder to turn a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we must face the unpleasant feelings that lie in each of us," Greene said.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you hear what I have to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest of the blacks - came into the room where Greene introduced her to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
He played the leader of Kukluxklan for many years, but according to him, he's a draining role.
"It makes me feel bad because it resists who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to return to that time."
The actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, namely Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcolm is arguing with Hester and blaming him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property, n---e!"
Rascona can't be.
There's been a fight.
At that point, everyone (at least every black-skin actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs at everyone most.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
“No,” Greene says.
"I just don't think the white people used to say 'n-n-n-n' like that."
"Precisely," one of the actors in the black skin will shout.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make sure there's four victims of a massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
Rascona puts emphasis on the correct wording of the word on N this time.
No one's laughing anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings a sad song by Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word he's in the room feeling sad.
On the background of all this, perhaps a dozen watching people wipe their sweats and tears from their eyes.
In the municipality there is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many watching from a nearby area.
Each of them has endured the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves in a crowd.
Until this moment, the murders could have been looked at with a distance, but now, standing at the same place where lynching occurred, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene's crowd will call for the inspection of the bodies.
Children kneel to the victims' heads, watch false blood and immobile bodies and whisper something into their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy shakes.
She'll run a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two acting friends and weeps in their arms; in the end, his emotions lie upon him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your role is in conflict with you.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
There's a young white couple talking about a play with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the ugly things... that people who look like you do because they look like you do," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topic," she added, "just called police fighting".
On the other side of the room is Tyrone Brooks sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment of reflection," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use are read only by the scoundrel.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where instructions for the use of anything were rather a raristic order.
So maybe my first phonograph contained only one piece of paper on which the hieroglyphics depicting the involvement of some components were all classified.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to cut off the backboard.
With a grin, he advised me what the paper with the maze was suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual help with the chronic toilet paper drop.
He found a braided wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl cookies again.
New times have brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit remover, where he simply adhered to a severed grapefruit, required about ten images.
Especially behaved was a draft with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The arrangement was twofold and the other procedure was simply not possible.
To give it to him required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for instructions ended at my self-propelled Seat Leon brand.
The 2003 production year still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, including the replacement of a bulb of blinkr.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions cautioned that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only three steps.
1st, take out the cover.
2. Screw out the cracked light bulb and screw up a new light bulb.
Lower the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limbs into the trunk of the car I would consider a spring, a screw that would be easily removed from the top and then I would follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's the bench's fault.
The cover had no space, no space, no space for the thin hand of Cinderella, not even the obese Spleen.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was further strengthened by the entry of my wife into the garage, which was called by a roar and words that she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked me insolently.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I missed the vulgar terms, there were only two public words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked the sentence that in a long-term union could be her last.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the author's torture procedure, where blessing with burning iron on her hands, which she wrote, after her escape so that she could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to a wide range of instructions from Kladiva to the witches, including his commission burns on the top of the Losin Castle.
"How about unmount the box?" said the battery-mounting woman.
In clear despair, it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought I couldn't be surprised.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who just got off the phone from a collapsed state after checking out two State Department officials for drug control.
I know him as a colleague of balance who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories with an unsettled voice.
"Suppose I got a fine for not having a manual on hand washing," he said to me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got rid of the whole problem, which was that the washbasin in the patient's bathroom doesn't have a picture guide to wash my hands.
His argument to the commission office that adults wash their hands usually can and that no icons are needed to handle the ordinary activity of decent people had no healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of soapy hands with running water was a primitive act at the level of the Cromanean, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
It is therefore necessary to tell them that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has eleven points, but in the end, it is a joy to discover that a person has washed his hands exactly as the landlord of SÚKL ordered.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity of the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem of urinating, given the differentities between the two sexes, the instructions will need to be hung.
The problem remains these pictograms, as creating a perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all the anatomy details, which could have caused some disturbance in the toilet’s prudence visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been wiping his entire life with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce the dividend in an effort to revive the business
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group announced that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
A further wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and early in 2019, follows a previous decision by the company to release 4,000 employees in the framework of previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce the cost of another £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce the cost of trying to resurrect the declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company that agreed last month to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 % increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital city of Kabul. In the attack, a NATO soldier died and several others were injured, officials said.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, according to NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in Qarabagh city district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed Tuesday in an explosion in the Herath mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol with members of the Afghan army was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are at the American military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is an important source of concern for NATO's Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb in a car killed at least 30 people in the Kabul Shia district.
The Taliban has signed up for the attack.
On May 31st, it killed more than 150 people in the city centre, the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US troops overthrowed the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already questionable situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of American soldiers who should assist military forces and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have shaken the public's confidence in the government, its regulation and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghanín's reputation in recent weeks.
EPA re-examined its decision to remove smoking rules in response to the lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered States to reduce emissions only the day after 15 states have sued the Agency.
The EPA has notified its decision to proceed with the ‘Ozone Standards 2015’ in the middle of the night, saying that it is presenting the Agency’s commitment to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June an effort by the EPA to postpone ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine, on the basis of measurements, the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint Tuesday on the ground that the EPA's proceedings were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is working to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have launched counter-measures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA, on its website, states that air breathing with ozone content “may lower lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár suffered a wound and blood flowed!
This, in our relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monster event in Czech relations, hosted by such leading personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by no one other than Leoš Maresh.
The purpose was simple, to show yourself to the public and to introduce his music video to the song of Sarah, whose baptism was hosted by the newly appointed personalities.
However, few know that the recording of the video that took place in Russia was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shooting with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it didn't go without a lot of awkwardness.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in the video, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a slap in the face.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, it immediately came out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said that it was an accident and Ladislav could not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the filming.
We are now bringing you the video of a young artist, and you can also record the scene with the impact.
An unsettled version of blood, however, has not been used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a duel.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most intense boxing match in light weight, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in the offices of the ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia - an unbeatable champion in a light weight World Boxing Council - went down to the hall where he welcomed the Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in a Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test".
“I’m a former cockweight champion,” Garcia adds.
“Because of the Broner match (67 kg), I had to get it together, but I’m not that big.
I'm a little small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the lightweight category.
The locust has to get back together in order to get light weight... then we can meet.
They're after the fan.
Why don't you do it to them?"
The locust agrees.
"The box would benefit from this fight."
Climate has made a request to pay attention - which is part of its strategy. The puzzle should complete its debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year meet with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on 23 September for the title in the lightweight vase in the Forum Arena.
"The match should be conducted in the style of the payout, that is what fans ask," said Garcia, who later said that it is an open opportunity to broadcast the match via the television station that comes with the best offer.
"We are the main attractions.
No one else will draw that kind of attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a “beautiful boxer” and could participate in his Saturday match.
But the loser didn't give Garcia the credit when he said the champion of the three Riverside divisions looked "very slow... sorry to Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other's duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other game gets so much attention.
And I am very happy to put it into the fire," Garcia said.
Ločenko said: “I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey. ”
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search has spread over them, but without success.
And the police ended up with no evidence of the investigation.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, there was a sad end to the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksara in Cuvashk.
Only because of the documents that were left in the car did the police manage to identify a few.
The documents survived a decade under water, without them it would take the police a lot longer to find out the identity of those found.
A few were last seen when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by the frozen journey leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after its termination.
Latest results of the age-limit tests for applications for asylum in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Röttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to better assess the applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measures were taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
By today's date, the Swedish Migration Agency had submitted 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency had now published a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the question was “may be over 18 years of age”.
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the questionnaire was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall only be made if the age of the person questioned is contested.
According to Johan Gâransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Replacing last month, statistics are kept in busy tracks and the numbers are very similar,” said The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated at 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years of age or older”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interrogator stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
Critics also awaited the medical method of determining age, which includes dental X-rays of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person in question went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements for age assessment are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro told the newspaper.
The forensic medical agency Agency's G ́ransson defended the decision with the words: “It can generally be said that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the 18-year limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, in a January call to Mexican President Enrique Pennít, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes out of the transcripts of interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump built a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his pre-election campaign last year.
Immediately in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after entering the function of Trump Penja Nieta, he was undiplomaticly punishing himself for being critical of his plan to build the wall.
He identified the southern neighbour as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You cannot say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27th interview and threatened to cut off contact with the Mexican President if he continued to make a defiant statement.
The funding is supposed to come up with something, and eventually it'll work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore because it's unacceptable to me," said Trump, an American daily.
The wall is the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall Trump issued shortly after taking over power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3,200 km long, and the relationship between the two countries has also been compounded.
In late March Trump said the project would be paid by the United States for the time being.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also briefed Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
Such a conclusion was drawn by the exchange of views on the agreement under which Australia will grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from internment facilities in the Pacific island States.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but then he joined it.
"You can definitely say that this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump said.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump noted.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people who will go to work for local dairyers," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led in late January, about a week after arriving at the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
The call with Turnbull finally called it the least pleasant of the day.
Before ending it, he highlighted that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place at the square in the capital city of Yemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, and then he dumped her near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl affected the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood first in the thousands of heads of the crowd, who met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under the law of Shariah.
After his execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the crowd, shouting the word "let justice live."
A violent man in the square was brought in by a police van from which he was pulled.
Cops tied him to his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired immediately.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr. Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the law of Shariah won," he added.
I stood in the square of liberation in Sana and waited for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's small body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife, Jamileh, and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would be destroyed by hateful madness, the killer would fall and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Hutí.
But Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 wounds with a whip right after his arrest, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge decided to punish him for his death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, she found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrifying," the media said.
"The morning disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a horrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she found out her daughter's body was found.
Rana was going out with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where she was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we were looking for nothing.
Yemeni residents were abused by crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The Deputy Justice Department read to the present crowd a report of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show any regret over his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the officers read the verdict to him, but the convicted man only looked at his executioner in flight.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many records on the Internet that the crowd had obtained.
The governor of West Virginia announced a political change
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at President Trump's meeting that he was moving to the other side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said Governor Justice.
“Today, after a long prayer and meditation, I am telling you... today, as a West Virginia resident, I cannot continue to support you from the position of democratic governor.”
A crowd of spectators burst into joy.
"Tomorrow I will apply to the republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn't support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The defection of Governor Justice is another wound for the democratic party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of causing our country to rise."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the last drop for a party that is already so distraught without a leader who is in vain trying to find positive and unifying reports," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal
Former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian Athletics Chief Dmitry Sylahtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held on the eve of MS in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals. ”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the maintenance of the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations today," President IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also “satisfying” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have moved to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis headquarters on the preservation of the punishment imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from those dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
On the MS athletics, which starts Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug test is still inadequate and the exclusion of trainers continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the end of the presentation of the IAAF board.
The CzechTrade State Order was obtained by František Savova, whose state is in pursuit.
The public contract of the CzechTrade State Export Agency was obtained by the Young Front of František Saviva.
Officials gave him 100 percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his release to the Czech Republic.
The CzechTrade Department of Industry and Trade export agency issued a public contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the Young Front of the entrepreneur František Sarov.
In addition, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The case was pointed out by the current.cz server.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be decided by 60 per cent of the price offered and by the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
And it was Savo's company that was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to the information Touch.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what moved her before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated on 404,900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it has obtained a sub-average assessment of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
Tendru was also attended by BDO Advisors and the digital agency R-Media, which also belongs to the current.cz server under Economia.
VLM argued against the result of the tender several objections by considering its assessment unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, the Commission decided to attack the competition at the ÚOHS Competition Authority.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted against the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the contract on the basis of a strict subjective assessment, the clearly favouring participant of the Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," the proposal for the initiation of the procedure submitted to the ÚOHS this week, published by the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors, VLM Michal Klima, scoring the selection commission appears to be an incredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the contestants to be unlikely and suspicious," Klima said.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed itself to the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not comment on public contracts in principle before they are closed.
All information about you mentioned contracts shall be published in accordance with the law in the Contractor's Profile and in the Public Procurement Gazette.
"When the contract is completed a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves for its course," said the media representative of the agency Štěpán Longý to Dotak.cz.
The young front responded with a statement that it considered extremely problematic that the Economia publishing company had intervened in an article in Aktualno.cz in a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that Article.
In the tender, she could have been helped by the fact that she was the one who was providing the BusinessInfo editorial service in the previous four years.
The contract was first won in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savo blames the police on tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions from his companies, which have caused the Czech State alleged damage to up to CZK 770 million.
Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its publication since 2014.
According to Savoov, his crime boss is behind the Yes Andre Babiš movement, which is influenced by the Mafra publishing company.
Last year, the London Court rejected Savo's appeal against the issue, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case hasn't moved since last year; from Great Britain, we have not gained any understanding on the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to this day," said Stěpanka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Attorney.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was a company called Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson Chesco-Buyer brewery, and the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is classified as an investment fund that purchases endangered assets.
He should also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly the Legions, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Sauvov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker drove down the sidewalks and the park, ended up in cots.
The biker drew attention to himself by driving around the streets, walking and park trails in Ušovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to go in the direction of the Station.
"Policemen with increased caution followed the city when on one of the side roads to Mariana's Spas he failed to drive and with a motorcycle he entered the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to arrive, transporting the injured motorist to the Plzeň hospital.
Afterwards, the police found that the biker owned a driver's license, the registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his article number deleted and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"The driver’s presence of alcohol was excluded on the spot, but the test showed a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football affect the movement of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not disrupt Neymar's record-breaking move from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Lize Masters.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transgression was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Following are several financial conditions of Neymar's crossover to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a wealthy Qatari family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymara into the already-star football family.
Clubs may spend huge amounts on buying players, but on the other hand they must prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after the entry into the chair of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs that were in debt in pursuit of new efforts would eventually cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, she redirected the rules of the FFP from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent the bitter sums for the player and build a global brand - suddenly it was not so beneficial.
For the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may show losses up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Cheferin is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive spending.
"The rules of the FFP still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who oversees compliance with the rules of the FFP.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-time payment, it may, for accounting purposes, extend the amount to the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
The PSG fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and ordered the reduction of the League of Masters team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA takes care of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Therefore, even if the Qatari company is sponsoring the PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding granted by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar’s income in the PSG could, according to some reports, be compensated by the organisation’s MS in the 2022 Football Board in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied that Neymat should become an ambassador of MS in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be detected by UEFY agents.
The previous PSG sanctions mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday, the dedicated UEFA did not launch any investigations into Neymar's transition to the PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, as the situation with the PSG was not valid to comment, according to The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with net profit of EUR 10 million and turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The closures for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of jerseys.
The club promises an increase of up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The representatives of the Spanish League, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to destroy Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the rules of the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ to the club and the state,” stated President La League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatar union.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares La League's position on financing the club.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has changed the football world in the last 15 years from its foundations," Wenger was heard Thursday.
“As soon as the owner of the club becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosicky is going to the square.
Same scene as the Sunday game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan backup moved against the Red Star game, invented several goals, but his teammates did not go to the black.
The summer team pumped with new multimillionths of energy so that after the initial twofold in European cups it ends.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal was scored, it took four shots, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, raise our confidence so that we could get away from something else.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta have gotten into the game that long?
The game's been worked out.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we shot once in a half-time.
Of course, that's very little if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we were able to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with the large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it's one of the pains of creating a new team.
We've only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already played two games each other?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, or the situation will get worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I'm terribly sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Show me something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing you like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we've been fighting each other, we're playing together, so it's not an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur is to spend ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is expected to spend ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in his complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, that the actual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, considered the complaint unfounded, found the CTK from the Court database.
The U.S. is not another court of appeal.
"As the fourth instance, it is not possible to assess the factual or legal doubts allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution said.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where the resolution also stated that he was in the decision-making process of the US.
The penalty imposed shall be at the top of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court considered the case to be an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served from 2005 to 2008 as chairman of the Board of Directors of the World Service.
The damage of CZK 645 million was caused only between January and July 2008, with a total flight of over a billion according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties, at least tens of millions of crowns were taxed in mere hundreds of thousands.
The World Service and some companies that the company was trading with have a relationship with Radomír Chorala, whose justice has measured for VAT machineries in the business of drive materials for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court before time.
The series “A Summer to Survive” and “Comrade Detective” play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for characters from the famous 1980s; and for the dirty 1990s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, for a modern time, especially in 2001 than the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Ruddd developed into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is an easy parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the point of view of the franchise, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin had said).
The authors deviated from the main funny points - middle-aged actors who play teen horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later” in which adults play does not push so much on the emotional level and satira is a sporadic place, including the parade on thrillers from the 1990s as “Hand on the cradle”.
At one point, the figure finds himself on a pile of Apple Powerbook harpsichords, roller skates, and “a series of other things from 1991”.
Many of the main lines of history are repeated.
The warmhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, still did not move through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Especially fun to watch the ever-young Rudd with long hair alias character Matt Dillon from the Youth movie, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old paprika.
Francis could start moments of random madness, such as the more recent series “Seven Up” until he reaches what I assume will be logical indignation: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, when the whole group will be released in the final scene for the premiere “Flights to No Survival”.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Revivalism of the Cold War series "So Normal Americans", the film "A Atomic Blonde: No Regrettably" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene are collided.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandr Tanaka directed by Rhys Thomas is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the form of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tough Gregor and the idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Pieric Jr. and Cornelia Street, who acquired the English language Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (like cops watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The show was lent its voice by many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
However, the "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the impeccable propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and according to this it also looks like.
Six long episodes are too distracting and comedy moments are not enough.
During a shorter follow-up, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in which two fatters devour burgers based on a large crowd.
The clear message for the imaginary communist community is that Western culture can transform everything into food and orgies.
The inventions of Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not wait for the ban to be lifted from the IAAF.
The IAAF International Athletics Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian competitors' start-ups due to the state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which starts on Friday, has turned out to be very clear.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is unable to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as IAAF Rune Andersen, head of the special investigation team, stated before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some elderly doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned and coaches with a reputation are still working in the country.
Even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still fully operational.
However, RUSA can already perform testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians who had previously demonstrated that they had been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
But they won't be able to start in national colors, and if they win, they won't be able to play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a dramatic economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background” in terms of maintaining the interest rate - despite the expectations of family budgets.
The political actors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25%.
In its Annual Inflation Report, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that during the next few years, there should be growth as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit, and also stated that more than expected growth in the financial markets should take place in terms of mobility.
Committee members also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from next February, the Plan of Term Funding, which will offer a cheap grant to banks, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less compared to the planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term with pressure on real household income and consumption.”
On the subject of tariffs, the bank stated that it would be necessary to ‘retract monetary policy belts’ to calm inflation, ‘to a greater extent’ than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any growth would be "allow" and "limited".
The Bank reduced its growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % forecasted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
Following the publication of the estimates, the pound dropped against the dollar and the euro.
Libra fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried the hope of further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although it should be slightly increased by the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest report on inflation is a minor comfort for households affected by rising inflation and by poor wage increases. The Bank said that the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "can't prevent" a reduction in income in the coming years, but is expected to "express" the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to a strong interest in British goods due to weak pounds, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came one year after last August the rates were reduced to 0.025 % in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a decline in pounds.
The Bank estimates that full price and economic unification will take at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was increasing domestic pressure. Three political actors demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Last month's inflation dropped back to 2.6% of June's 2,9%, even though the bank stated that it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun relative to 2 % of the target was ‘completely’ due to weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “In view of the recent collapse of swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook toward the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and mortgages - there are no fees in the offer, as well as the low rates they gain on their liking."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV medicine to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access from September to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention based on the Supreme Court’s decision to finance NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP) pill used before sex, which reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health care to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, stating that NHS has the funds to pay for the PreEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of General Director Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention”, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as “the decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. More clinics will be joined in October and full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV medicine used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PreEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
PreEP before sex means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinics and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come taxpayers for £10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully burden the ever-increasing and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years' effort to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Trust, said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is administered correctly and to patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to negotiate a partner, which will lead to improved quality of life.
We accept this declaration with pleasure.'
Ian Green, executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘The priority number one must be the rapid application of tests throughout the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP available and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the trial period PrEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will lead us one step closer to a full understanding of the PreEP benefits.
Now it is important that we begin the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect the people exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on a high foot: mid-floor and smart design turned this small apartment into an Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is an impressive demonstration of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same height ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and that day I nodded at him."
Since then, he's been through an apartment about 1,000 square meters of complete reninning.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an intermediate floor to use a high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used the almost four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights as to climb two gaps - a challenge for architects so it was to create an underground on which to walk directly.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
‘The steel structure is completely complicated,’ he explained.
“We had to organize both rooms so that we could walk straight.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so as to make it at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
In the underground overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short walk is equipped with mirrors on both sides and it looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store accessories and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the entire apartment the impression of a much larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Precise kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a folding door.
“We had to solve the technical site,” Erfan says about the tightened doors.
"The door is equipped with counter-inhibition to be easily opened."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage facilities, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you are selling is a residential area - or an appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate agent shall, in essence, calculate his price on the basis of the residential area at the time of entry into the apartment.’
In this case, it has been possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You will not love the electricity distributions in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts do not gain."
As it turns out, quality design and increase of living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is dissipating.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has repaid her and has declared an adversarial ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in its fullest sense, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
It is that California has banned state money from travelling to eight other countries, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a law on conscientious objection, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community has no obligation to provide them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again passed laws under which religious charitable organizations that have received children from mothers after birth to adopt do not have the obligation to give adoptions to same-sex couples.
As a result of these laws prohibiting the conscience of California, it has prohibited the financing of the travel of its citizens to the eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that Californian professors must not have a trip to a scientific symposium in Texas, for example, paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions like Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must obtain either federal grants on their journeys, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has become patient and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it also does not like California's high tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but does not end up in California because of this travel embargo.
He's laying them down as revenge for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban to another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all States to stop this madness.
That's a fact, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
The States have the right to enact laws on conscientious objection, and to decide what their money goes for and what they do not dare to do.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why should he not offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under the penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork even if the butchers offering pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination suit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the right cakes for hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can regulate domestic policy in powers that are not federal according to their own preferences, i.e. according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community used to legitimately strive for tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and letting all reasonable people live, but some activists strive not to tolerate themselves or others, but to extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one can ever show moral, religious, or philosophical discord with the LGBT lifestyle, and if so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history where states have done this on political issues, except in the case of one.
Even at the time of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was in the 1950s, the political cause was slavery and the North war against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the Blue Democratic States and the Red Republican States is deepening and the US is mentally dissipating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin has been fined fat.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wanted to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
The official head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but in general he is expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and brought him to court.
He fined him for calling people to demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Later we take them off the judge's salary," the critic of the Kremlin joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential election because he had been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The fines of 300,000 rubles, namely 25,000 rubles, were handed to two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the scattered opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalne in the campaign in every way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing Kirovles Forest Company.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The verdict is so valid, it prevents Navalne from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
The two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire by their Italian family, are hauling over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has reached a dispute over common assets and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the heated dispute is constantly denied before the highest court.
Along with her mother Anna owns a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the whole family sold the company for $85 million.
For money, other properties have been purchased and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, construction properties in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about a third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is “a significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages properties for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has become a problem.
"Collin's proposal sounded in my eyes very much in his favour," Paul wrote in a subsequent court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also contend with who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to Colin's statement, cut off.
Colin resists the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In his previous post-approach statement, Colin stated that he believed in a healthy solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that the family is of the most importance," he wrote.
Costs at the courthouse are rising. Hundreds of pages of instead of incoming statements, e-mails and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defence counsels from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and candies from the 1950s and bought a tour in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a real estate in Collingwood for the money obtained by stopping the property, where Colin opened the first jeans family business.
Colin said that when Westco founded “in the last year of college, Paul was still a young, about a 10-year-old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family. Colin said that Mark was compensated at his departure with $10 million and Luke with $26 million.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark put it, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of the AFL Club, as Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and Colin's best friend, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutisov and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only to Colin through a text report stating that, given the fact that the dispute is settled before the court, “I have nothing to add. ”
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to handle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, one of Colin’s court statements stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a healthy solution".
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will be settled soon in court," Colin wrote.
A bucket in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower kids.
The drivers of the MHD fassify water and summer clothes.
At Mother's School Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the trees planted do not provide a great shadow yet.
There's no pool, but the teachers are showering in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children remain in classes where shutters and curtains are withdrawn.
The air is trying to cool the air, because they don't have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature that is in the interior and exterior exceeds the hygienic limits for maternity schools, so we should not actually have open operation during this period," said kindergarten director Miloslava Makovicová.
There's a glass corridor in the kindergarten where it says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and there's a blind on the south side that we're protecting.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
There are better conditions in the forest kindergarten on the Hrazi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nut, there's a table under it, and there we do all kinds of things," said the headmaster of Barbara Companová's kindergarten.
Teachers with children try to walk into a forest where there is more coolness.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure dispenser that is used to spray flowers, and we use it for showering children," said the Company.
Also, the director of the mother kindergarten on Novoborská Street at the Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in shadow and drip them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then he doesn't go out until after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They may choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or a diluted juice and have water drinks in their garden.
They also have a vegetable salad and always fresh fruit and vegetables to eat each day, which their parents sometimes bring them.
"Perhaps today, one mother brought about a ten-pound melon for the children," Makovichkova added.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms in hot days.
The cabs of tram drivers and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokesman Aneta Rzehková said.
They are air conditioned in addition to the cabins of some trams and in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks haven't seriously damaged anything yet.
There's been minor damage in a leash in the Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have enough drinks available.
"Cold drinking water is available in all strings, turning points and carriageways," Rzehková said.
The so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called cold soda are available in tickets and in some places.
Drivers also get soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that enhances the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic eliminated 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic rose over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in firefighting.
"They prefer fires in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work," said firefighter Nicole Zaoralová.
The firefighters were not relieved by the evening weather when storms and tides changed the heat in many places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went to 236 strikes.
In particular, it was the removal of the trees and branches.
"The most affected in the Central Bohemian region," Zaoralova continues.
But firefighters also needed help in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague’s rescue workers.
On Tuesday and at night Wednesday, ambulances drove out for ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning from punishment.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warned the paramedics.
Coal oxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released in imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media diet
Many tried it before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he did, he'd be the first.
Politico said that the new chief of staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news reports - in the hope that he will keep Trump on the level.
Here's part of Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met for the first day in his new position with the staff, he outlined the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intended to correct: the incorrect information that is being sent to the President.
Kelly announced to the staff that he must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or word - because the President can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth on Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate for him to show that he was spoken of in a positive light by a lot of other media that was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri of the Polico portal then wrote that “the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay — at least according to the six former organizers of his campaign — is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that sing praises to him.”
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something they don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more upsetting if someone didn't control them.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, their efforts did not go unnoticed.
To date, however, no one has been able to prevent Trump's subjects from becoming controversial.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by encouraging Trumps to move materials -- which they can, but they don't have to be reliable -- that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the advisor's tendency to provide doubtful information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Contemporary and former officials of Trump argue that the President often reacts in anger to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone posted a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of Provokator Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “a source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
No matter how much Johnson was sentenced to Twitter for harassment, or that he did not submit his claim with any evidence, or that he had already published false accusations and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “tried to implement the system for the management and documentation of the information received by President Trump”.
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
Maybe he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just fade away, and his assistants are still competing for power.
These constant factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be a burden.
Tourists negotiate a burial and return to “Millionaires’ Quarter”
Several of the most mobile homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again taking over with determined tourists, who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to regain the field behind their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in the field at a flourishing street in the city of Solihull, called the “millionaire district”.
Bringing horses, children, and armies of caravans, tourists return after being discharged in May. They did not fear a ditch that was dug on the spot under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found the gaps in the defense and entered the field with the caravans unprotected by the gap that served as the road.
The indignant people of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull City Board by saying that “it is not able to solve the problem”.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: ‘ They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place and now they're back.
Last night another arrived, and today there are probably more coming.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham administration knows how to deal with this problem. To protect parks she uses court orders.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't want to pay any more taxes until the board of directors settles with tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last of the departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
Press spokesman for the Solihull City Management Board said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorized stay on land near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem in a timely manner.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behaviour of the policy at number 101.
So we'll get a complete picture that we'll present in court.'
The MEP's wife hit a car in Brussels.
The government special brought him in.
The government special sent the wounded Robert Zitnjansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
There were two ambulances waiting at the airport, and on board the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went uncomplicated.
Robert Zitňanský had a serious accident at the beginning of the summer in Brussels, according to information from TV JOJ.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After his transfer to his country, he was transferred to a specialised workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is married to the Slovak MEP Jana Zitňanska by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
She's got three kids together.
The Italians are anchoring in the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue vessels of NGOs arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minni's warning came the day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organisation refused to comment on the whole matter on the charges brought by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"It is for us and it will always be a priority number one saving human lives. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social networks.
"We can comment on all the current charges only after all the information has been collected and the situation has been assessed."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship of the Yuventa organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, who were handed over directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reported to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Yuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they do not constitute any ‘substantial change or obstacle’ to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minnit has heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy during rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors bear fruit.
"In the last days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the subject of economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unashamed Mesarošová: Silicon and cellulite crawled out of her body!
The hot summer days are all about taking the most necessary to cover up the most intimate parties.
Only Dominika Mesaroša does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all that they had to do with TV Prima, she was just sneezing, she wrapped her calf in a mini-controll.
And it was just a few regular moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Because he cut it between the halves, and he coughed up so high that she had to fix it all the time.
She certainly had no need for the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter was convicted of sending text messages calling for Conrad Roy's suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter spends 15 months in jail for two years and then spends five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who took her own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father confessed Thursday in court: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened with 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouses, Carter stood when she pronounced a verdict on the spot with tears in her eyes, with her hands together with her eyes pointing towards the ground.
"Its conduct killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said.
"She ended his life to ease herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, legal representative Carter said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on her conduct. ”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother’s statement to Lynn Roy: “It will not be a day before I grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sister and we will face the enormous pain that we will bear with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was being “trapped ” by her knowing that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of a person I have seen since my birth is the pain I will carry for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts has no law in force that would affect a person who assists in the suicide of another person. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on a car seat poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after text messages were published to the Carters, who incited suicide.
"Maybe hang yourself, jump out of the building or stab yourself, I don't care," said Carter in a text message just two weeks before he died when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “Just throw the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to abstain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison. ”
Audi will adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the headquarters of BMW - that consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted large-scale use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide, which is released by diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles for the installation of gas neutralisation equipment issued by diesel engines, making it less competitive for cars.
While German car manufacturers face careful examinations, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which in an effort to meet emission limits installed software in its vehicles, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the engine development department in Audi would have been arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is of Italian nationality and therefore is not subject to extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German Automobile Police in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits - and thus extended the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi car in the investigation may have a slight impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is an disproportionate share of the profit of Volkswagen.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
A man and a girl died.
There was an accident on the beach of Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 km south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias television channel said that the plane flew directly over people who sunk on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board, both of whom were taken out of the accident alive and taken to interrogation by the police.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's not built, even though it started building in 1978.
Even though it's unfinished, it's always being fixed.
And it still can't be built, even though it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 Castle Highway.
At least a few months later, the Earth’s Children’s Movement stopped the construction of its next section.
We walkers get highways in pieces, like they're cutting salami.
They'll cut the wheel and then we'll see when and if we'll ever get another one.
At the same time, we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get the trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite streams of trucks go straight through the city of Jaromír or Nachod, which is not as reasonable as hugging.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was operational in 2008, i.e. nine years ago.
Not a knock since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to the Castle of the King began recently and at other sections to the Jaroměra began an archaeological survey with the beginning of construction at the end of this year, you could hear loud bangs in the eastern Czech Republic.
Nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out he's not going to show up this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Land-Club movement for sustainable transportation from Brno has decommissioned.
The children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
Decisions on the construction permit were made to the full extent.
They shall request a review of all the binding positions already issued by all the authorities concerned in a decommissioning.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Dražna.
So for now, we're leaving the D11 near the village with the pronunciation name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we're preferable to join the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the essence of the communication problems in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually incomplete in the existing system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandules from Provence threaten climate change
Levandules have become the symbol of Provence in the south-east of France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levandulí escapes as a result of the dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, stated: “The growing of lavender in Provence has been threatened because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate also have their fault."
There's a lot at stake.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
The possible solution may be a more efficient distribution of water and a slowing of water evaporation from the soil, but also a spray of lavender protecting a mixture of clay and water and nobility of several types resistant to dry weather.
The killing of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the week Riodoc meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and non-stop drug wars.
Today, however, under the pressure of recent events, he is meeting primarily for his own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give each word names - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and premonition.
They are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal acts.
The violence continues and the bodies are being carried out across the country; journalists among them are constantly on the rise: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been under federal protection since President Enrique Pena Niet took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, although his presence is all-progressive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription “Justice” on which the middleman points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a picture of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and Panama hats.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, two suspects have been sued.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime.
Journalists from Riodoc insist that they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though the destruction of the grief and the territory in question are now very treacherous.
Without information on murderers and without a view of justice, the safety meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left Riodocé in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to get away with several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and executed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the name of the article - which could be translated as the 12th river.
The shooters then got into his car and hit him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two grown-ups.
Rumors seem to spread fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is still suspicion of silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest fighters as a rival faction tries to fill an empty place.
Every day several people are killed in Sinaloi streets, and the cemetery is full of two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “peace ” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes to the United States of America.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoc still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
She believes that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could have angered the sons; the suspected gang members gathered all the copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the capture of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroeste periodical, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and start along with five colleagues of Riodoc.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade, ” said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoca gained a good reputation for courageous and true reporting; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship — readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Riodoca won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabot award for the Latin American story.
That same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when accepting the price.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “life-form,” Valdez said in an interview last October for Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do with the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The workers of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his joking and unchosen language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone was relying on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine of his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things have been banned," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not playing here, hands are gone.
The problem is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “the sense of being mad... and then the Javier thing happened. ”
The old rules, according to him, are no longer applicable in Sinaloae - as in the Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; several days ago a spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two officers find relief from 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C] in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect Riodocce's offices, located in a four-story building in Culiacanu Township.
Journalists are making fun of the fact that these police officers are not exactly among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who are corrupt according to the government.
It's been a few months since the press last set out in the upper areas, which are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the murder of former boxer's brother Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to suspicious government spending that took place in the governor's hometown.
Recently, there have also been several abductions in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the office of the Attorney General.
No one officially announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so the journalists were alert when they were going to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is linked to a certain policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors were recently accused of high-post corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín’s sons, “El Chapo” Guzman, escaped military intervention.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal, 46, who is called "El Flaco" for his skinny figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office changed at the store of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and issued the following morning to demonstrate to the office of the Attorney General for another journalist.
Salvador Adame only disappeared three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the burned body was discovered, and the authorities claim it's based on a DNA analysis of Adame.
Journalists' activity is increasing throughout the country. Many organize protests and traipse on sidewalks and buildings “SOS printing”.
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is on a visit to Washington to seek international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “covered ” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and careless public.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels but also by ordering politicians and security forces to cooperate with organised crime.
The Articulo 19 media watchdog accused more than half of all attacks on police officers and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of a blogger named Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my reports. ”
There was a keyboard and headphone next to the severed head.
Some branches have decided to cease their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte based at the northern borders of the State of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartel article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's an awkward decision.
Finding a job in exile is as difficult as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being chased and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after his escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone rings.
There are reports that 19 people died in a gunfight between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by members of the union promised.
Journalists publish this news from mobile phones on Riodoc's website.
Not one day will run and the opening title will change again.
Police sirens indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez is looking at police patrols to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't reveal it in any way.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their period - whose middleman is the pronunciation slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first find of an amazing creature of the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high extent that experts were able to determine the red-brown colour of his tufted skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
An article in Current Biology magazine stated that it is “the most preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
The fossil is a new type of nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of Creda, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers who described him with the words “remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the armored whitegrocer is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, was drilling in the Suncor Millenium below near the Canadian Alberty.
He ran into something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have spent the next six years working to detect an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'Just a little eyelash and you'll believe he's asleep,' said Caleb Brown, director of work and scientist of the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin researchers found that this herbivores - although covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - were likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years old dinosaurs' ancestors Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently available in Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully discovering fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of the sheds and armor all over the body.
They discovered the masking method that today's animals commonly use in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with disguises - such as deer, zebra or belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to fight for his surviving literals.
“The transmission of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the period of chalk,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the sheds also revealed that the skin was probably reddish brown.
Researchers continue to study animals and search for further knowledge of his life, including the preserved contents of his stomach, to search for his last food.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at that time, the climate was the same as in Florida today and rivers and oceans were dragged far further inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved tufted skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” said Brown.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to get your eyes a little close and it seems like you're just sleeping.'
During the period of chalk, huge terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, moved on two legs, walked the earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus Rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally terrible ancestors.
Among them is the Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta's body was washed out into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, was drilling at the bottom of the company Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the chalice to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders were about two inches thick.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous species has roamed the territory of Canada today until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured canvas around the skull still covers the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote the National Geographic Gate, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to the winning of the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding seems to me.
The fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured canvas around the skull still covers the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right fore leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
It's easy to count the dumps on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a cousin from St. Louis sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through her Facebook posts on her phone.
She ran into some high school student's contribution.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper of St. Louis tweeted his post on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white-skin police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body lying in the street, where no one took him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put the phone down so she could come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and held the sign in his hand with the inscription “The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son”!
She watched live news - one of the officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and at the other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman was holding in her hand a gun pointing at the crowd and shouting: “I will kill you all... animals. ”
"This is not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?”, which will be included in the August 11th cinema.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and integrity told from the perspective of people living in a community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flowery jersey and the same flower leaders - on the subject that they had discussed many times before - "on experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"It was not considered that I would not take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the culmination... of the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organisation, but it also had to learn the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own skin, she is no different from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, she was the first stop on South Florissant Road across the street from the police department to become the base of activists expected by police officers Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to emerge slowly.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9th,” Ferrell said, adding that she was president of the Minority Student Nursess Assn in her college degree, and was seeking health care and food in the Black communities.
“I had no experience with the organisation.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a later codirector of the document, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used? ”
This type of skepticism has infiltrated the community through many people, often whites who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent conversation: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often ignored and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners throughout the death.
His participation in the project also attracted Ferrell and six other local residents, who were followed by the team “Whose Streets?” in the years following the murder of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the rescue leader, but about the community's rapprochement," Folayan said - it proved to be the one that is most open to film participation.
The document “Whose Streets?” thus describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face when she thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that to do this job and police black people, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves freaks.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions ultimately stand behind the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women. ”
However, it insists that “this is not just an affirmative matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
“that it is she who is found in the front lines is no accident, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the power surge in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television cameras cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell's spending two and a half years on a roadblock at a demonstration.
She described the social political atmosphere in the area she called home as “the disorder. ”
Still, she has not stopped trying to commit herself to since she left for Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a burning field in Cologne.
There were dozens of firefighters on the scene, and there was a helicopter.
Near the Czech Brod in Kolínsk, between the municipalities of Bilany and Liblice, there was a fire from 14:00 a.m. about 15 hectares apart.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen declared the third degree of fire alarm of four possible.
According to the firefighter Ladislav Holomczyk, fire from the air also helped to extinguish the helicopter.
At 6 p.m. the firemen were able to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine room of the combine.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out a total of six strips of water.
"We handed it over to the owner instead, until 8:00 tomorrow he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," the Holomczyk said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Friedman Gallery is placed immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and white - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the swabs from the mouth cavity and hair that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the unauthorized publication of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, information and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before leaving the presidency of the United States.
The algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, was created by Dewey-Hagborg's British, if not by an intellectual comment on DNA subjectivity - as well as by many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the indescribable determination of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since she was a young man about being considered a woman. She was convicted on the basis of 20 indictments in 2013, including violations of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photos were kept by the prison staff. Only one black and white photo in lower quality was leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly concerned, sits on the driver's seat in platinum blonde wig, which is now connected.
In 2015, positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg Project were still felt.
Within the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette and gum burns - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And this is when she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to fill the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, neither visits nor photographs were allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse have been friends for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could have participated in the exhibition in person.
In fact, President Obama asked for Manning's release a few days after his release, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people who are seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to encourage their tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything happens for some reason".
Under an artist's declaration on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls her huge signature (the letter "i" in her last name is drawn from her heart) after the end of "self-involved factionism based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded by pencil.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we all are.
"I hope that people will take it from this, that our genome does not care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and can be interpreted in its own way," said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
It shows Manning, which emerges in King Kong's manner from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as he prevents you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It is a direct copy from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in the comic book - but when it does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome patterns, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high statues of Manning, where her genetic haplogroup is recorded with pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to smell crowds," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
“I wanted to guide the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her.”
Professor Northwestern University and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
In these days, there is a nationwide search for a professor of Northwestern University and staff of Oxford University who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police said.
An arrest warrant was issued Monday for the murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death, reports Cook County's trial file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Police officers were alerted to this fact by telephone. After arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot, and detectives are investigating a murder case.
Lathem has been working as a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
University speakers and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were in fact shocked and wished to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public contact with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," Googlelmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Googlelmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to events that were to take place in apartment No 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Googlelmi said.
Grand Plaza issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working on a timeline and victim profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria for the new plan has been completed and RUSA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the RUSA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the code contains nothing that should disturb Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned above calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes' doping by the government.
Mutko said on this subject: “We are investigating because our antidoping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutkova's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian antidoping agents, but he added: “We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, General Director of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSA is “on the right track” to regain its validity.
The police accused three people, one young.
The police accused three men of setting up a centre fire to a rare wooden church in Trinca-Gute on Frýdecko-Městeck.
One accused is young, all three are Czech nationalities.
They are facing up to 15 years in prison for the crime of general endangerment.
Today, the Moravian police director Tomáš Kužel told reporters.
He thinks it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole thing," Kugel said.
He said the police would discuss the possible detention of the accused.
Further information may not be published according to the Director.
"I can't communicate any more so far, because the criminal police and investigation officers are actually working on the matter, and the public prosecutor who supervises the matter," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in the Guts dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is uncountable.
After the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Kateřina from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
That's when the power failure caused it.
Then an exact copy was made in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
It'll support their training.
With financial support for state defence communities, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the actual purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is to count.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of processing it from the government, promises to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes out of a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would have spent hundreds of millions of crowns in support of defence.
The main aim of the proposal is to create an effective system, according to its authors, which would help to increase the willingness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the fulfilment of the defence obligation and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the associations of amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to increase the capacity of their members.
In return, he would obtain information about people who are willing to come to the country at the time of the crisis for assistance and their abilities or material equipment if necessary.
Accreditation instructors could also be available to assist communities and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also includes organizing words with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to oversee the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would take advantage of their abilities only after the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual removal of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," states the intention to refer to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Minister officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that allows every citizen to respond to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute, if necessary, to the protection of others, and to avoid any difficulties in carrying out tasks to the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would result in considerable financial entitlements.
Their level, according to the Ministry, will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Authority envisages financial support for projects to train citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be extended, which would employ 42 other soldiers together.
The Ministry's representatives have already stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement between some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on the holding of arms.
It would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons the directive prescribes.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite her promise of anonymity in research, some employees expressed their mistrust in the process.
"I sought consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New human resources startups are constantly emerging on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' duties, startups allow companies to make rapid votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, and also offer absolute anonymity to employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass the supervisors and contact the director directly.
"There are instruments on the market such as Food and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint Startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she had gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and what they were feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a running overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low rating - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case of becoming another Uber - which is rejected in scandals after a former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complementarity sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Converter from Denver in the state of Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “bright” surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Justice has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convergence launch.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not act - it can face costly consequences as a result of the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Converter for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look for a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, formally file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who had previously found no reliable way of monitoring complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using the Converter, there is a rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from a real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It is approaching a holistic, overall view of staff experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and participation of employees into light weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed after Enron’s collapse in terms of the abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “you lighted up the social media on the whole thing ” did society come to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in a closet in an online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
In his February campaign of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totalled $10 million and eventually took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are spending their time with a society that is striving for a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convergence and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that a lot of investors will be found to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is, once the company asks for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and no concern for the employees.
"When you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies that rely too much on the data itself.
“Because when you don’t finish things, the staff will start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts an employee survey every month, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganise several teams within the company and start training communication to solve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday takes a very important view of her employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve high employment in the field, which is known for its frequent release.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing your employees, you will lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company collapses."
Thursday has become the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower of Hodonínsk so far the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
So he overcame Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about this.
Against Tuesday, but not a lot of temperature records fell.
The heat hit Moravia, mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday, the records were exceeded, or the records were leveled to 35 of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years old.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, in The Watchtower, today’s temperature was the same as that of the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsk, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pogorlice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Watch Tower, were from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, the largest heat in Dyjakovice was in Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyj in Břeclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not prevail.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and Northwestern Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ web site, today's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The heat started to grow there until now later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will be heard gradually according to ČHMÚ and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
We've had a lot of trouble around here.
Billionaires don't need the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burdo and Antonín Frycz, is sponsoring the Robyšek Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of the company.
The convicted corrupter and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has acquired a private party.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrej Babiša's project was named after the Deputy Mayor Jaroslav German, is a chapter for itself.
Recently, the Ancients also caught their billionaire.
It's Dalibor Grandfather, the owner of the company on Jablotron's security device.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The mayor's jersey didn't work out very well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to move YES to make the Mayor's movement win twenty percent of the election.
Lecdo smiled.
But the grandfather's argument is more ominous.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinion.
While he intends to apply for the votes of the electorate in the Old Age jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babish in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Grandmother is not a shot-up speaker and does not rule by a popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he definitely doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babish will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to get out of his world, which is under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Elders presented him as a new force, he confessed his admiration for Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to cooperate with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and is behind his own no matter what kind of jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babish is sending someone so immobilized to the Elders.
Others may ask if Jablotron’s boss and his boss, like Agrofert, have broken up in a bad shop and are looking for another way to defend their business rival.
The first public performance of Grandpa was not just around Babish.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Elders.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement could hardly be stopped.
Zdeněk Bakala, the last known Gauner of Justice, threw millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the Vita Barta security agency, TOP 09 and the civil Democrats have come together like this for almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to the political side.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation for us.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with college education come to our house about 50,000 a month.
The ones with the base on less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in this environment.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather’s vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state, in which they do not share much.
In short, the rich need help to avoid poverty.
The elders can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and shake Babish's hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there's the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the State as their employees and country as their property.
And in the end, those who want to live well in a rich country are not just some people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have cost $234 million.
The sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And many times he doesn't even have 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the US President Donald Trump is selling it.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
He informed the web site Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hi, Donald J. Trump."
Get out of here like no other person.
However, even the connection between the real estate company and the American president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean residence by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £11.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
So even after a discount, the villa complex stands like 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gyms and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of palms are planted on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that communication with the President is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual prices of properties on the island.
Trump bought a real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin's Island.
But with a new price, it's a second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to quit two workouts a day. For Bruins, long days are coming.
Eleven o'clock in the morning and UCLA American football players are hitting the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, an unfailing sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing is supplanting a noon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for the meeting that takes place next morning at 6:30.
"For these guys, they're going to be a real makka for the next three days," Coach Bruins Jim Mora said shortly before Monday was overturned on Tuesday.
By excluding two trainings in one day the NCAA wants to relieve players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final exams are over.
This is why the first three trainings of UCLA are scheduled at 19:15 - to seal into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora spent in the position of coach in Westwood, Bruins training camp begins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. His influence on this is also to limit the number of trainings from two to one a day.
A total of 18 training sessions are planned by 20 August, starting formal preparations for the first fight against the Texas A&M team in September.
It has to be heard that it supports the NCAA decision, even though it added another item to the already loaded player charter.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding land from the nearby parking lot and the luxurious hotel Luskin Center, which the players occupied after the netting of the guard behind the goal bar.
Bruins players should take the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He's good at that kind of stuff.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded as well as parking lot No 8.
We'll make the most of our resources.
I believe everything's going to be all right.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough fact check to limit the number of fake reports
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news", the largest social network reported on Thursday.
The company states in its statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will be sent to third parties for verification and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election of President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is taking place. French voters are flooded by the avalanche of false reports on the May presidential elections, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, in a further statement issued in Germany, Facebook stated that it was about to launch a new function of controlling false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party-verified reports, people are asking for more content to be better informed and be able to make the right decision about what they can share,” said Facebook’s Product Reporting Manager Sara Su on her blog.
She added that Facebook continues to test "related articles" and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake reports.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotty Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeez group and its refuge was also found in Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotty was a witness of 700 years of violent history from his cozy spot near the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired curly Jamie Rhodes of the York County - known for his fondness for his historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The look on the letter of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes said with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived on the castle of Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by the archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jakobits," he said.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, the support of National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying almost four months in the castle almost as a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, walking through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyena head on the wall and the bottles that had been thrown down for centuries in the trench.
He walked the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to the hysterics, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
At night, “he drank whiskey and wrote. ”
The confidential history of Scotland is relatively unknown, as the National Trust organization gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes had described in words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were throwing their hands with the words, ‘Bring it into the attic.”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps representing property: “You may think that the land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I stumbled upon one case where two families dragged on the birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and sink deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion in the castle of 1380, which was in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"In fact, the English uprising began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected somehow."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom Darrell's family hid after seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes ’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation — men of that time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
Various generations of the Darrell family have been dealing with this by taking rich or old virgins - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who were fond of the heirs."
With the end of his stay in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
Recently, he returned from a two-week station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was swallowed up by nature.
But for Scotty, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now I'm going to go back to real life'."
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media released President Donald Trump's comments on the new US immigration plan, which will also bring about a change in the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is thus expected to decline by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules for granting temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, thereby changing the rules on the issue of green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process is preferred by English-speaking applicants who are channelling funds and demonstrate the abilities that will benefit our country," Trump quoted the media as saying.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be alert
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are currently really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a declaration on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be ready to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable master to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course is artificial intelligence, which imitates the behavior of a person.
The user can “adjust” the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own “personal personality ” that would disgrace the Stepford virgin.
Modern inflatable virgins developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement wife different characteristics, including shyness.
And then there's a sex robot woman named Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is supplied with preprogrammed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "roady" character.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” says True Companion’s website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even as moody as people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in a mood. ”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming immediately for several reasons - which do not include the exchange for real human relations. Rather, the inferior female traits and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (thous resisting) Farrah.
True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't she have a man named Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
Sexual robots, however, are not just a fetish or sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for subtle sex with an optional addition.
Of course, most men do not buy a robotic woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots remain at the edge of the public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by the present modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them the excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world get their rights and the White House is home to a president who expresses himself very leniently at the address of a woman.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The story of the servant is not what we see - hanged bodies and dislocated eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The book template The story of the servant girl is a step in the right direction, but it seems to be a small step at the moment.
Sexual robots are supposed to look as much like real women as possible (with porno actress rates).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to touch and to act at first sight as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personal personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing to incite their independence or to violate their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
He says the 21st century: servants.
NBA star on green armpit.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose in spite of his first screw-up at the premiere start among professional golfers.
The double winner for NBA's most useful player played Ellie Mae Classic's lower series Web.com Tour in California Hayward's first round on 74 rounds and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second NBA championship with the Warriors team this season, began very nervously and his first launch ended up in a liquor holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as precise among the pits as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four wounds above the pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first launch, but then it got a little saddled," Curry said with a huge trauma on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me to play 74 in the first round, I would take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cut that will likely be set two wounds under the steam, he will become the first representative of another sport to be able to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the stress, I think it will work," said an enthusiastic golfer who has already played celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
It's the first time Hayward's ever started a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic received a sponsoring exception and maintained amateur status.
The series Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against that, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The Trump era is an unfailing sign of the political divides that divide American voters and, to a micro extent, tear apart entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the U.S. newspaper was filled with advice on how to deal with relatives who chose Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for the nerves to let us.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to mold the family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York this week and who has been paying for a Republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that face to face with a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the whole family - including all the Republican siblings, with whom they conspired about politics for many years - is on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing, but I'm shocked that it's a significant risk in the broader context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrible possibility that his pranksters might lose their attractiveness one day.
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing republicans, who, in opposition to its standards, will suddenly be embodying what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very minor misdemeanors compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits, and we took the kids to Central Park on the biggest bike that operates the New York Park Department - you won't find any better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered with glassamine - clowns and animals are filming and in horror looking at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and the rattling music is amazingly similar to public transport.
Many clichés will soon grow weary: the view from the tall buildings, the panorama looks at you instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty years later I still did not move beyond the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - it does not count the thematic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the subway station in London.
However, the ring in Central Park is a wonderfully magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children enjoy it, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the wheel, it would be worth as many points as possible, but luckily, no one is asking.
This week, I had similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my “application” on a scale of one to five when I was paid with a credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, with the difference that I can add 15% tipsy for something I buy at the counter.
Not only is it slowing down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is so forced to sneak into the favors of shoppers when not necessary.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to the wrist that the prison said he caused himself to fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed you had her confused with a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six - year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it will appeal to South Africa's highest court and the trial will take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius is threatened with extending his sentence to 15 years.
In the South African Republic, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity to a Panda that had mated in the wild.
For the rescue program, the panda is a huge success.
Because the center is trying to expand the Panda Genofond in captivity.
A staff member at the Chang C-chung Centre informed the agency New China that panda breeding is at great risk of a family crossing.
In captivity, there were only 471 pandas at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
The effort to mate captured pandas with these wildlings is such a first step in helping the panda breed protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the panda mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every step of the way.
His chosen Chao-chao meeting 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle because panda males are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males estimate relatively poorly the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The young were born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, she weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement was quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1st in the morning by the Sithonian police.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place all season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Spilk is 50th in British Open's first round.
Golfist Klara Spilková is ranked after the first round of Major British Open in 50th place.
The court in Scottish Kingsbarns passed a score of one under a pair when she played three birdies and twice bogey.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player is so hopeful that she'll be able to get through the show for the first time on the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million grant competition came out best to America's star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-shot field record, eight under a pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority has reported that it investigates 20 percent of all Dutch poultry holdings, meaning that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types are identifiable according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a risk to adults, but is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have joined in closing their livestock, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the problem insecticide marks have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration, the eggs from Belgium were the last in the Czech market in April and the eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium appeared in the Czech Republic for the last time in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of products against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'm going to miss her, says the goalie Sedlaček and looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," smiled 27-year-old Sedlaček, who could start the season in the Zlinski jersey.
It's up to him if he gets an engagement by the start of his new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it like I did at school, it would be in three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie I've been trading with again.
Last year I assumed I'd catch it all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only scored five points, so the coaches started shooting.
At the end of the day, he caught my colleague more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
What was life like in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slav who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I haven't seen a problem in the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play in the blank.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Wasn't it a problem for you to travel and move across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's no problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done by playing maybe four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians even feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball, it's a national sport.
All the fans.
Even though it didn't work out, there were a lot of people walking around.
Did the work of Dynam in KHL help to ensure that Latvia almost entered the quarterfinals in this year's world championship?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results on the world championship have started to go up.
At the 2014 Soča Olympics, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada close to 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlín and Ralphs Freibergs was before the contract was signed.
How come there's so many of them coming here?
They're not any bull players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
It's a natural course.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
By the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Riza.
That's when we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams who decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlin and I'm waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I picked up something at KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is, when and where will I sign?
How real is the possibility that the new year will be in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it blows.
All I can do now is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Would you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't like that so I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight to Letus is continuing.
In January of this year, I wrote about the camp in Lety near Orlík.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the main passages of the article to be recalled.
There's been talk of a camp in the Summers for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at, for example, the official site of the Petna site of Leta.
There, in the beginning of the historical review, they learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Leta, that it served as a labor camp since 8th of 1940, from 1.1. 1942 it was a gathering camp, and from 2.8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners of flight were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4.5. 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
There were a total of 420.
The very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings that have caused them human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place at the site of the suffering of these people.
There's another problem.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s it was nearby and a pork camp was built in part of the former camp.
The history of the camp coincidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was discovered in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and tear down pork, but that is not the case.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has fallen under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the session.
So briefly the facts of the post-war fate of the camp.
Last fall, the government approved the repurchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pork.
According to the Minister of Culture, Herman, "some numbers exist, but I think I'd like those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert's up to.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions; others say the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap thing.
And only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were financed beautifully by the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, which is probably not a threat, it would be as much a waste of money as I think.
Doesn't the government have any other priorities?
The monument, a worthy fifth place, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the ongoing tragedy and anyone who wants to, can bow here to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's just leave it the way it is, and keep the spot as tight as possible.
A responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should deal with the care of the proper economy.
At least with one of your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
However, I perceive from the perspective of the above facts the password of the ANO movement leader only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went straight to the place.
Very decent driveway, furnished parking lot, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and with a view to its own spot, which is made of stones placed in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as is and is due.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the found bases could not be reserved and made at least visually accessible.
In this direction, Culture Minister Daniel Herman could exert his efforts.
If he succeeds in the government to enforce the buy-back of state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be nightmares.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: eating rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom causes abdominal pain and diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and milk products to relieve the symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acids tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support gut resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of weight are tilted to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells that support body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of triptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one type of bacteria, called Lactobacillus routers, which is a common part of the intestinal microbiosis and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more triptophane the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it proved to be the same for man, then a combination of L. routers and food rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of a certain type of immune cell that supports body tolerance found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separate cells lacked them.
It led to one group of mice having a different intestinal microbiom - a community of bacteria, viruses and molds that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse was tested by the method of DNA classification and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing a second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiom - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given the bacteria L. routers - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivated L. routers in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerance cells.
After removal of the active substance from the fluid, it has been shown that it is a by-product of triptphane metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophane in the mouse diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice and most of us keep L. routers in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether triptophan by-products from L. routers cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in triptophane-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of triptophane in the presence of L. routers may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with Nenje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United “genius”
Manchester United won the team "genia" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least he thinks so after the magazine debuted in the centrifugal match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the contract for £40 million, entered the first match with win 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match in front of the UEFA Supercup, where the United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a hostage by Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in a team pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and only played 45 minutes, according to Mourinha, where another season of Prime Minister League should be worked on before the start of the season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - it thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukak also played the first match at Aviv Stadium and Mourinho began slowly forming his eleven for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists that the club did a "fiction job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they've done the most for me."
Life's challenge to the King of Chicken Skins, Lady Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multi-promising picture began to be drawn thanks to a new TV show by the Prime Zdenykov Academy.
The pears immediately lighted the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for this at your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you, hand in hand," he urged him in a video on the social network.
And since they've been on top of you for several years, the ship hasn't forgotten to tease him this time.
"In return, I can teach you French from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why your favorite roasted cheese is," Pears said.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss," he said to Lightning.
However, he did not express himself because he was filming new works of his next show, Yes, boss!
Only Prima reacted to the participation of Gruška in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity that goes off television.
He planted a big morning for Phrushka Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
Over 300,000 pieces have been sold in a few days!
The new show presented yesterday by Prima at the press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme is an unforgivable cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from a number of spectators, and in 12 works he introduces them to 12 cook techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the chef cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his shirt let the crossed pears iron.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"On top of that pear I'll just smile - the pear is healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins," said the ship.
The ship's culinary art thinks of itself.
"To cook according to the Lady of Pears is out of the question even at home, because I will not run the gastropunk at home," the boss clearly says.
I really appreciate Pohlreich's zdenek, even he thinks I'm making honey chicken.
On my show, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," he did not forgive Pears.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical analphabet or moron," said Pohlreich about the pears in a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to shake hands with them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Pearska said in his account.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip placed in the body. By just waving his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, a thirty-year-old, had a small chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, supervises the procedure of implantation and follow medical procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange locks of doors and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child let the technology integrate into his home and his car the BMW Z4 brand, which will start with a simple wave of his hand.
White House requisition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly in with a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the naval records issued by Time weekly for $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the program of July 17th in the White House, which was an exhibition of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a show of products from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was built next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
A military officer of the White House issued a fragmental order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "emergency" event, reported Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the representative of the Navy Commander for Aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17th at approximately 7:00 p.m. to the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearing of the whole place, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was further said that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for return flights due to working time regulations.
The original crew stayed in place that night along with the helicopter and with them also a security detail.
It was not clear from the records - which Time had received - whether the second crew had finally been sent.
Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were sure that everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander said.
This “Made in America” show was labeled the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But official events also have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the President promoted a health reform that the Senate was going through and he was talking about trying to keep government regulations at the forefront.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
They're used by the presidents when they travel.
However, their presence for purely presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the president's plane was in the background at his first campaign meeting in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is stifled by complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane.
“The White House is pleased with the “Made in America”, which presented products from all 50 states produced by Americans from American materials,” said press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current training of the crew, the State official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew into the “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no other props were paid from the taxpayer's money.
Speaker Sikorsky said that the company was not in any way interested in the South Lawn helicopter exhibition negotiations.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the compensation for the expenditure of DoD for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records show 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to state the costs of tax payers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation for the expenses of the DoD does not cover the cost of staff, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for show purposes.
"The idea of the show this week is to present products produced in the USA," said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defence of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of a helicopter and other military facilities that produce countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his tour of South Lawn.
Back in the White House Trump addressed Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorski very well," the president said, "I own three right now."
A young woman was tied up in a swamp at Mach Lake, and the police were arguing with her.
The girl left for the beach on Sunday about two o'clock in the morning.
But instead of bathing, she was trapped in the swamps.
When she decided to ask the police for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That is why police officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesman Ivana Balaková said.
A number of police patrols went to the location she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the officers had to walk hundreds of feet in rhakos before they felt solid ground again," Balaková said.
And she was also missing.
The police were guided by the direction from which her call for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
The police found a woman in the swamps at Borný.
She was on the verge of both physical and mental forces and she was showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called took her to the Czecholipian hospital.
Grandpa's connection to the U.S.?
The bride is becoming a saleswoman.
That's a little ironic.
His web project searchnameslusny.cz as if a billionaire told voters in essence that Stan suffers from the deficit of decent people.
And he also claimed that a politically unrelated party of less known mayors and independents does not actually have a national programme for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after talking to Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vít Bart started out, and it didn't work out so well.
With its quest for decent people and personalities, which some mayors will replace on the candidates, which Gazdík has allowed, in addition, Grandpa also disrupts the chief of state's favorite argument that the most important value of the movement is precisely political verification and experience by mayor, traditionally the most popular politicians, and according to surveys.
Now they're taking a quick turn for an unknown person.
The total breakup with the people after which the state changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement did not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if the U.S. of identity suspected only a few people at the time, after Grandpa's arrival, it's just an identity game.
Not only did Gazdík long set out against Yes Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Grandpa, who publicly praises Babish, said: "My goal is to make the YES movement, then the Starost movement will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he's not mistaken for the movement.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and he's certainly not a billionaire.
Politics is often spoken of in the same way as Babish, but unlike him, it is not its own political brand.
For a while now, the STAN has been reminding the reality of the show rather than the real political side and Grandpa's helping hand as if it were making a saleswoman more out of the bride.
For a while Stan went with the TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs practiced helicopter crossings in Mosta
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs trained in helicopters at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be afraid and afraid of flying, said the head of police kynologists of the Ustec region of Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
They trained both adult dog training at the Bridge, and those who were just going through training.
In addition to the standard training to detect sharp explosive samples and search for a lost figurine in the lake area, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter gets here, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The helicopter will hit, the dog will go and immediately look," Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or on his way by helicopter is unable to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of the time, they keep them for example in the garden," said Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ustec region.
German Shepherds prevail, but Belgian Shepherds also come.
The dogdog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal potential health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and insecure, he shall pass the first tests in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get to a sharp impact," Tomášek added.
The length of police service depends on the condition of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
Then they experience most of the time with their dog guides.

The third season of Narcos will be held on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections may be credible only if they are attended by all members of the company, including women, on Wednesday by the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women participate in the election to local representations, three women apply for the post of Vice President, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The roles of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his central statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if they are attended by women, as well as by all related processes related to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, moving international combat activities to the second round.
In this year's elections, for the first time in all, one democratically elected government is handing over its power to the peaceful next government.
Haysom said that the strong roles of women will strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission stated that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are women.
A unique brewery makes beer again.
For a good beer to a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the brewery in Lobč near Mshen.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted to parostructural operation.
It followed the years of bloom when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, they've served the buildings of a state ship.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was demolished and analyzed for construction material.
In 2007, however, new hopes were sparked in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They devoted themselves carefully and devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is as similar as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of a brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and, moreover, the construction became part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015 they also renewed the tradition of brewing.
To taste the great lobby beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořinska, visit the spa in the area of the brewery.
In brewing beer here they use coconut water flowing in a protected landscape area, malt from the lobe fields and harvesting hops.
You will taste the traditional light sunbed in the ravine, but also the dark beer and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, it's Saturday and Sunday at noon and half.
The biggest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortifications of its kind on a global scale?
The Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacler, at the top of the field ridge above the village of Babi, was thus a unique building.
Initially, it was to form as many as 12 bunkers connected to a vast underground area.
Here was the headquarters, the barracks, the ammunition warehouses, the materials, the power plant, the engine room and the hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, he was able to build a single massive concrete bunker and underground spaces were broken down.
Thanks to stachelberg’s enthusiasts, who began to construct a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground's been made available from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry shaft with exposure and underground and the armed object of a light fortification, two further deployed infantry shafts, trenches and the scientific path of the Fortified Trutnovska are part of the site.
Refreshment, cozy altar and breathtaking views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian’s port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery of Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a powerful four-wing building of the convention above a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately it belongs to the unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
But the fans don't want to give up, and they're holding a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year's Evening for the Monastery of Chotěšov this Saturday of August 5th, where you will get off. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Vos, you will see the Šermír performance and look at the places of beautiful extensive buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look the Neanderthals in the face?

Recognize the plant with one click.
New free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbarians and ordinary plant lovers.
If they're interested in what kind of plant they just ran into on the walk, these apps will advise them.
All they have to do is take pictures of the plant and the apps themselves will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education of CEEV in Bratislava Mountain Park within the framework of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project was also attended by pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who took pictures of and added plants from their surroundings with teachers to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the site Secret City Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants the application can recognize.
"Children who hold tablets or mobile phones in their hands can go into the forest already," said project coordinator Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which will then be assigned under the photograph in both Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovenian and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database to the application after the account is established.
"Francouse will assess if it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's Glasgow
The departments require assurance from the manager of the McVitie's cookies about the long-term obligation of production in the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company is still silent about any investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory, which produce, in addition to other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that she had invested more than £5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be ‘between the first informed’ in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company’s builder, the Scottish GMB authorities expressed their concern that McVitie’s “will not receive its promises of financing and modernisation of production lines”.
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the builder regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and employees come mainly from the local community and Glasgow, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, rising costs of life and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
Pladis’s spokesman said: “The builder Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross were held two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to the staff that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we are assessing our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and efficiency of operation.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local sites, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the plants here, employees and trade union representatives will be informed without delay."
Did she warn Barcelona PSG about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to take her side after she has made $189 million, i.e. the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record invasion three years ago?
The League 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the crossing of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid £89 million last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to meet Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been alerted to this fact three years ago by the President of the PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll definitely call one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to win one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed a conceivable line when she expressed interest in PSG magazine Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would it allow an Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill with Neymara's departure.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have wide-ranging rules?
Donald Trump nodded on anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madur.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing with the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like that.
Even that makes the idea of sanctions smell like straw from shoes.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has really set out on the path to dictatorship, to totality.
China just doesn't behave the way the American president would have wanted.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it up so that the usual voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what it is about and what the system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only reaching out to what President Obama has already set out to do.
Then why all the excitement?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the US elections, we would hug Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions don't relax, but they're tightening.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zipries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker once again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten EU energy security.
Is it like using sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The usual voter is melting.
For three years he had heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the mine truce agreements in Ukraine.
Now it's learning that it's EU energy security.
The voter is melting and spreading.
There are sanctions coming to Russia for overmounting where it's not.
China is thinned for getting a little bit mounted.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship on the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finished the election program.
In addition to the Pardub region, all candidates are ready.
In his own words, he did not intervene in any way.
He even agreed to be led here by the Haytman and Shadow Minister of Education Yes Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a hattman," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
A lot of representatives and national politicians you've pissed off at the fact that directly elected mayors and prime ministers should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a proponent of direct democracy, we elect a president directly, and I am convinced that we should still elect mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about interference with attorneys. They can still be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In the presentation of your book, what I dream of when I'm sleeping, I heard on my own that you were talking about canceling the board.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct election and reduction in the number of deputies.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1,171 representatives.
And it's hard for the primary to say that she doesn't build and prepare big projects, but she doesn't have the authority to do that.
The same is true of the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, ruled in our history.
I'm not saying they did it right.
The current prime minister doesn't drive anything, he's just moderating the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a change to a one-wheeled election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and a regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are supposed to work mainly on committees and committees, not to be presented at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 Members, cancel the provinces and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and prime ministers you will rule the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislature by a third, while 57,000 French are there for one legislator, while 17,000 Czechs are there.
However, no one blames Macrona for jeopardizing democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election mostly, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The sums for who has a parliamentary majority, however large, are only to look in Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the YES movement threatens.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did they overvote me and add 21 percent to the members of the Gibbs who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on it as a prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurecka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue in the government, they're supposed to argue outside.
The cabinet must have finished material, there is no place for coalition splits, strong voting and business, there is to be decided.
How do you want to have a consistent team when ministers act mainly on the sidelines?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement was not valid, and Babish left the government.
That's what any prime minister can do.
But if he is a person and he has driving skills, a similar gesture is not needed.
It measures everything the same, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all, because I don't think we're going to be in the government, and nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so badly.
So much skepticism isn't in place.
The mayors have won a company called Grandpa, who would like to work with you, who may win you the wing of the favored Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaoralek, who does not rule out the coalition with ANO, in the ODS we may have Václav Klaus ml., which will also not oppose.
I'd leave it at the polls.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President Yes Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamurs come into view as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say so.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as Vita Barty's VV puppet, then made money at dawn for his company, and there was a coup going on.
Of course, he's a prominent person.
Of course, it's a bit brown.
When I take his program, there's a lot of people involved in the management of society, direct democracy, that's what I can agree with.
That's not what I'm asking.
I wonder if it is acceptable for you for a person who has xenophobic opinions to speak in a demonstration with gallows and wants to get out of the EU?
We're not considering working with Mr Okamura, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It'll be about negotiating a winner with another in order, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's going to be the two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to stand up as a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go away, never made a decision.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
Because Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ ruled the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has adopted a resolution written by the management of the CEZ, which he is depositing with the Minister of Finance, how he is to vote in the general meeting of the CEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff ratios of the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus, if I'm going to be Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not that guy yet.
Word is the CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to trade for even better with YES.
Well, maybe after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a lobbyist named Humble or Pink, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not handling this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you stand in the lead of the government, will you seek to replace the management of CEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, i.e. the institution you are criticizing?
I want CEZ to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years now, thanks to the commission for the traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to be in the CEZ Majority, he never drove it, he was only there in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, appraise them, put them in a subsidiary company, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me run a permanent purpose campaign, but I don't have, and I won't have the authority to throw anyone out.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public radio and television charges about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at the way these reports are going, the super-powerful pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalouska push me out of the government, which added a percentage of TOP 09, but the CzechSSD put them on.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, thus talking about the threat of democracy to Babish.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President, Yes Jaroslav Faltínek, builds a power base by placing his son on the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and by arranging a contract with city and state companies, such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways, related lawyer Kvetoslav Hlín?
There's a permanent dispute in this.
I don't like it, and I resented it several times.
Faltínek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we've never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no Short-Aid, no Brezina.
If there was any sign of clienteleism in our house, we fired such a man immediately.
I'm uncompromising in this way.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
