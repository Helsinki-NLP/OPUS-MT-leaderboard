What will he do? CzechSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new councillors of the capital of the Czech Republic will likely have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the office.
Dník Aktuálna.cz members of the new board from ČSSD "tried" as they know the notoriously established slang that was created on the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Prague political wastebasket during the previous era by Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councilman did not understand very much.
At least he's saying it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am in Prague politics rather a new one," he responded to the test of the "Kmotrovski" vocabulary of the council for the culture of Lukas Kaucký.
And while it was a political veteran, so did Councilman Karel Brezina.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you present to me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't recognize slang in general."
From a dictionary whose phrases the journal Aktuálna.cz published in June before the ODS election congress, she selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Master's.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldmort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the sugar shop", "the bull necks", "the betrayal of the capital" and "the stain".
Three of the councilmen agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is expected to run Prague education in the future - first the interview promised, but later he did not take the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter Dolinek just rejected the test.
"I don't solve these things at all, and the way the civil democrats are enjoying themselves, I won't appreciate it."
"I am now deciding how we will understand each other in our programmes," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukas Kaucký would not know in the title above that it is a talk of an influential businessman and friend of the exterminator Bém Roman Janoušk.
"Voldemort" does not tell him anything, and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's a Blanca tunnel," says Kaucky, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the paper."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language class," he jokes.
The golf hole then, like the Blanca tunnel, decodes not only the matador Karel Březina, but also the environmental councilman Lukaš Plachý.
Both social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachym is also familiar with where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the term "go to the sugar shop".
"I think it means to go to some Prague business," is Plachy near the resolution that it is the residence of Janushka's companies.
Along with Brezina, he reminds us that he drew knowledge from the newspapers rather than from using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequency, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions running.
"I've been working with colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes using abbreviations and crimson names," says Czech President Petr Hulínský of Prague, whose customers call Huld.
"At school they called me Břez, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," he admits to his own nickname, Karel Březina.
The journal Currently.cz name has tried and works.
Councilman Weinert is for clients Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned about himself before the elections when sponsoring the party, has in some colleagues the name "Playground".
The nicknames are also the only thing social democrats accept in the intra-page speech.
Hulín says he is not happy to hear, but the journal Aktuálno.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of Obstetric Law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský won his title at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of witches, published a brochure
The women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common features.
Rather, they belong to an older generation, cannot engage in work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate can only be very rare."
"Even young healthy women do not give up because they help with their work and give birth to children," describes a regular sister who in the capital of the West African state, Burkina Faso, is aged more than a hundred women in a special house who have been evicted by their communities in their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information brochure that should help the witch hunt limit.
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard noted in his paper.
The accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is next door to Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah, who died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured oil on her and burned her.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was lit up with oil used for ritual anointing.
He said after the group wanted to "banish the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
Der Standard quoted a two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devourers of the human soul have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the witch hunt is trying to soften the government, the president himself took part in the Gambia last year.
"The Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, launched an extensive hunt for witches who were supposed to participate in her death and try to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He called for assistance from shamans from nearby Guinea, who, with the escort of police officers, soldiers and the personal protection of the President, forcibly escorted the randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in her report.
On the farm, people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't make it on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal tenant: Melting in stones, higher rent signed
The older subordinate man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Apartment "uhlobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and a new lease on three apartments: his own, his daughters, and his son, who is in execution of the sentence.
All three have just been leased by the deregulation.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns from next year.
"And that is not warm water there and must melt petrama (a stone for solid fuel, note the order)," the man points out with his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," she explains half angry and half-resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new terms and conditions "uncorrected and immoral", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7 when it publishes instructions on how to deal with them.
But the man's just waving his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," it goes dark.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Eve, there is a large majority of apartments that still have non-market rents in the Czech Republic.
Currently.cz has therefore decided to visit the "labourer" personally.
Havířovska waitarna RPG is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
There's security from the security agency right next door, and there's a trigger.
"Lease 2011", flashes a special button on his touch screen.
One knock, and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number's already beeping on a big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a moment’s rent, the elderly couple are asked, but the rush in the waiting room is obviously not about the new rentals.
Most people came to solve common problems like other times - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
Letters with new leases are sent to the mailboxes in Ostrava by tenants of a total of 44 000 RPG apartments around mid-November.
The RPG Apartments in their letters suggest an increase of 15 to 38 percent.
A special barrier to new rentals was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's just a run," the employees answer behind the bar after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was very loudly caught by the Vice-President of Parliament and the Istrian relative Lubomír Zaorálek of the Czech Federation, and even now the local newspapers are full.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Neither did they change my toilet board," the man mentioned above relieved himself.
For the most part, according to the workers, pensioners are coming to see if they will get a discount if they sign the RPG in time as promised by the special offer.
Half a discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
Havířov's "deregulatory" barrier but the questions are definitely not covered.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 people here for the 2011 rent," workers estimate behind the counter.
The RPG, however, on the website and on its walls, proposes the individual negotiation of contracts where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the rent, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its website.
"There will be no trial," one of the employees of the RPG Apartment and the man on the street in front of the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don't have to sue," he says.
But the worker's only going to be nervous about it.
"We'll see."
"Mr Zaoralek in the media tells them not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Apartment their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental is still not even as necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of RPG Apartment's residential portfolio, that it is the angered tenant that the neglect of the housing fund is the main reason, according to the owners of the house, for the increase in rents.
While between 2005 and 2010, RPGs were able to invest four billion in apartments, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling across from the semi-stretched seats of the Haviřov waiting room is still repeating several red-expressed information.
"An increase of 15% in 2011 and less relates to 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square metre and the month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will be up 38%.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," the RPG noted.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
The RPG Apartment promises that the deregulation will not expel the lease to the jumper, but will be extended to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds an additional commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will put the company back in the apartments, mainly into thermal savings - new windows and heating.
People who sign an agreement to increase their rents are supposed to get them.
The offices include the kindergarten, the architects understand.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new home of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, ideal furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
Arch.Design, a project-architectonic company whose studios formed a number of important Brno buildings, has calculated the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of babyboom, and she cared that women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of reduced obligations, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees under the social programme.
Eaters and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with care for the child.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme and the Czech State Budget.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2,8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After exhaustion of the financial grant (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school at its own expense for a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and was significantly assisted by Economy Rating with the request for a grant.
The care is provided by qualified staff, children are cared for by a nurse and an MŠ teacher all day long, so children can go to kindergarten without age limit, although most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "miniškolka", there can be only 5 children at the same time, but more can be changed during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the mini-school programme is comparable to the pre-school education framework.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation to school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop stress situations with late picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents thus make more productive use of working hours.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies, which offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened staff marketing.
The house of bones is fascinated even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudy
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish's mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to its organic shapes, he earned the nickname House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade resembling sheds and pervasive soft curves, that's all typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The front of the house plays dream lines, soft colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
The detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and precise order.
At night, the whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, illuminated so that the appearance of the shine of colors is further enhanced.
The bending and twisting of shapes with the same degree appears in the interiors.
The wood in the waves copies window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, hooks and leaves.
The House of Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, was rebuilt in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a whole new one, but soon he accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló's apartment house, but Antoni Gaudí didn't design it himself.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on its design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started a successful collaboration with Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of the Gaudi House of Casa Milá and the Güell Park, where there are other Gaudi works.
From the local house to the end, he earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to his organic shapes.
Others called it "the calling house" because of the specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is likened to the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include other sculptor elements of the building.
Gaudi designed a unique central heating system with ventilating vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree slope.
When Gaudí was created, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations of the time and did not allow them to be tied together.
At the beginning of the building, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later the city council was threatened and asked for correction.
For example, the Council objected that the construction involved pillars in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only 15 days after the city's challenge, Joseph Batlló requested permission (and successfully obtained) to rent the two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a social salon and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The whole six-story house cuts through the staircase, which can be climbed to the roof terrace itself.
The basic elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably together without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction also received an unusual roofing and two additional floors.
It is also impressive to play Gaudí with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are covered in the inner courtyard, and lights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light in all floors of the house.
Just bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun’s rays.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and accessible apartment to the public.
The owners decided not to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the famous creator’s birth.
The tours continued because they found that it was a very advantageous business and extended the tours to common and sub-creature spaces, including roof terraces.
The admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20 per cent discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with one of the residents of the cottage and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: Women have different requirements than men
Never a proud bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. mattresses and grilles, provide the basis for a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to meet the specific user.
The choice is made by a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior into which mattresses and grills are acquired is also important.
Typical example?
For example, weekend cottages, where they are not regularly melted, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they are slower to "heat".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
However, they may need to be rotated on a regular basis.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid board, they're holding off the humidity: there might be mold underneath them.
It is also the custom to choose.
Whoever has spent longer abroad, where many high mattresses are often used with a softening layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their beaten shoulders, feet and hips they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"This is also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misreceiv "information" from joints and skins," explains Sylva Hadamchik, who specializes in stuffed furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were therefore looking for a lazy foam mattress years ago.
"Today it's fine, suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a fighter from the NHL to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "mirror" works easily.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape according to absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't turn around at night like after a hard fight.
You'll just get better sleep.
The foam also works as a protection against leaching.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm so they need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in two beds, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, such as singlelists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands slightly folded in your elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Czech Chamber of Members and Decorators, who has been teaching the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and has been teaching it at vocational schools.
For a double bed, each needs its own grill and mattress, but here, be careful when shopping to sweeten the heights of mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing more than installing the grills into different heights, but you do not have to succeed in each frame of the bed.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres should be counted on the moulding and boiling layer.
"When touching hands or settling down on a mattress you must definitely not feel springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The whole bedroom, where mattresses and mats are like tall Siamese twins, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
The mattresses don't blow, they can't wash their floors, which is common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble a large (and blocked) net.
Even so, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life guarantees.
But everything has its own ale.
Therefore, advice from the sellers' practice: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work, do not give up a sensitive coating, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although the mattresses are usually produced today, they have run all over the circuit, so after the opening we can get two parts (for washing and washing size very important!), however, handling in larger types (and at one person) during the filming could be like a match of light weights in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a grill?
Never!
For one night's visitation, tops.
However, cover the board (if it no longer has) with vents and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (with it.Tashchenfederkern) and a boil layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-locational lamelas with 14 to 18 lamellas will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (need a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid the grills with more lamelles, 28 and more where the lamellas in the area of thighs are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
Positioning lamelas are not made up of spring-bone mattresses because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the lamel, you can also reach the so-called shoulder cradle.
It's a special trapping of lamellions that allows you to push, or even bend the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper is "removed".
For men who have shoulders over their backs, it's definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses who started using the softening zone in the shoulder area remember it.
Women are also remembered - they are being treated with softer surfaces at hip sites.
For the most demanding customers, long or plated grills with so-called multi-breeding are designed.
Pressure is distributed to multiple points and the tension is reduced.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grow the wrong pillow (big and "inflated"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only affect the shoulders with the tips so that the shoulders can relax.
As an appropriate size, it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the shoulder height of the shoulder (together with the shoulder handle of the grill or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original straws filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least premiums.
The trend is just the same as the mattress bio.
The crude oil from which polyurethane foams are produced is replaced by natural oils, such as from the jumper and soybean.
It is the soybean that is used by all known manufacturers.
"Was at the mattress means that the core is made of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also allow microcapsules to relax the fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" the plant extract from the birch to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the other hand, are "melting".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the sex is weaker.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with a broken cell structure, is more breathable than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various cold foam stiffness and "tiny" foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thighs and feet should be.
You'll pay for quality mattresses from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet the health parameters have a lower VAT rate are taken as health aids.
He was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattresses and grills is not easy.
Sometimes the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses at one price can be used.
The Magniflex brand, for example, offers a Duofreez mattress with all the memory foam of the Memory for 11 990 crowns.
The second one, however, is available for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density launched "space" at the pace of the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because at startups astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat is softening, but in the cold it's getting stronger.
The warm human body thus perfectly adapts and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of lesions, but also to increase sleep comfort.
Visco-elastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which ease the legs and the venous system.
For example, domestic producers use foam Eucaterm C or Twinsaver and so on.
Watchers want more and more parents, so they want to look after their children.
Fear of your own child has led more and more people to the idea of watching through GPS.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, such as in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatkova.
The device is about as big as a box of cheese, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were intimidated by the disappearance of Anika and began to stare at the means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I accept that in some cases such devices may be misused, perhaps when they are put in a bag to someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most really customers buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the box and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be controlled."
"Great expectations have previously triggered mobile phones for parents, which can be shut down as well as these monitoring devices," said Bočková.
According to her, it is also disputed whether an attack would really help such a device.
"When it comes to kidnapping, the perpetrator will ensure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the surveillance equipment is expanding, they'll be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it accepts that a similar device can help in the event of an imminent attack with pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, and when the attack takes place, the immediate destruction of the tracking device can help him.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If there is damage to it, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Dearer devices have built-in naclometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained stationary, the device will immediately send a warning with a position," the Czech says.
He says that a similar service can be used by smart mobile phones with navigation, where special software is enough to record.
The problem with current surveillance units is that it is either a device similar to the size of a box of matches or smaller mobile phones.
That's always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why the equipment that looks like a normal digital watch is now being tested.
"It will be the greatest advantage in the fact that any aggressor does not need to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll only know them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether they develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to guard cars.
This is a combination of GPS positioning (which use normal auto navigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current vehicle position.
The army has an incendiary cord to wrap the Czech Republic. It lasts only two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of ropes to launch cracks.
As of last year, the Ministry of Defence had supplied 244 kilometres of cords to the warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of the ropes is two, up to four years.
The army bought the fuel cords from the STV Group, and S.S. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff, in support of the purchase of such a huge amount of fuel lines MF DNES, reported that soldiers use 60 kilometres of lighters a year in training.
However, it follows from the military pyrotechnics calculations that the MF DNES addressed, that all generals, military officers, secretaries or cleaning women would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training each year.
Secretary of Defense Alexander Vondre and Army Commander Vlastimila Picka do not rule out.
It's the only way to justify the military's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of lighters.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the military supply would have been enough for more than ten years.
On the contrary, if it were true that for the basic training of each new professional, at least two metres of inflammatory cords, as experts say, are sufficient, the army has provided fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of women's or special units - supplies for the above 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained to Minister Vondro recently that they had almost no bullets in their handguns, so the shootings are limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me that they buy so many lighters from us."
"But it's their decision, and they know for sure what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as traders try to meet," says STV Group manager Jan Děcký.
Secretary of Defense Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased cords, even by the fact that the army will have supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcky of the STV Group only talks about four years of life of a lighter and police or military pyrotechnics for even two years.
"In perfect storage it can be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish his name because of the criticism of the army.
After life is over, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
The Ministry's next argument is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of burning cords.
"We cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of two hundred and forty kilometers," the spokesman Pejšek explained.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police only order enough to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
It was proven for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already in considerable difficulty with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing for the Rýn.
The Czech, according to the pyrotechnics that MF DNES has addressed, is waiting for the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometres of old lighters, which today "lasino" is buying.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I have won through the competition
The winning place in the Trader of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytlun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition was the 18-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
He bought a semi-managed house with five apartments from foreign brigades and a bank loan.
That he was still a third-year student at the university, that was a lot of courage.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us did not give me the opportunity not to try to do anything about it," said Lukas Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to hire foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back in the house, which gradually turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year another, equally quality came to him.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other applicants for the franchise of the Pytloun hotels," says storekeeper number one last year.
"And this sale of the hotel's licence was largely won by the Year's Chamberlain," Pitloun said.
The victory brought him more familiarity and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People met me in the streets, they often congratulated me further, and I must say it was pleasant," she remembers.
Participation in the competition strongly recommends to all those who are trying to do something.
You don't even have to win, every visual is good.
He says he's still drawing on contacts and acquaintances that he might not otherwise have.
"With some whom I met through the competition, I started trading regularly."
The fame associated with success, according to him, has affected almost every employee.
And he's got about 70.
"I see with them greater loyalty and pride in participating in something that has received universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is stuck in front," says Lukáš Pytloun today modestly.
I wish my successor a year calmer than we had in the Farm
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the goal of the winner, the Farm has worse times behind it.
For the first prize in last year's Vodafone Company competition last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Ždjarský, arrived at the Slovenian House last year.
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which he built a company with stamilione rotations from a small workshop in České Skalic.
"I can say that the awards encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence in the competition fight," the winner said last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karl Zdjarsky's father a small workshop as compensation for communists seized property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad started a company on a plastic bath.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in foxes of vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the unsuspecting public has been gained by the company after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," Karel Zdjarský said.
However, last year was not just a sign of euphoria from victory in the Farm.
The award was based on the economic results of the company until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
There was a crisis that had not yet affected citizens, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, did not avoid us either."
"The bids fell by 40 per cent, we had to reduce production and there was also a release," Karel Zdjarský explains.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they did manage the situation, and they kept the company profitable, even though it was less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not celebrate in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre with grants, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have received the main awards in domestic exhibitions," Zdjarský said.
All evidence is that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"To the new winner I wish a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," said Karel Ždjarský.
A survey that removes meaningless rules
A survey on Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the business bow.
Some senseless regulations have already been lifted.
The infamous winner of another year of the Absurdity of the Year survey became the obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also available to officials online.
She's decided more than a third of the four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security required a paper extract from the trade register, even though the official could obtain it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the poll, it's gonna change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register for checks on insurance payers," said Czech Spokesman Jana Buraňová.
To highlight all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the senseless ones cancel them with the sense of the competition Absurdity of the Year.
This year, it is the fourth part of the business drive organised by the Economic News and is increasingly popular.
When some 3,000 voters took part last year, there were almost 4,000 of them this year.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that only serve to keep the business going are still enough and enough.
"For example, we are in the world's leading positions in the number of tax certificates," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in any way compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic placed itself in the 74th position in terms of business conditions, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity Competition of the Year was first announced in 2006 and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The website www.firmaroku.cz then selects seven candidates for the "antican" and lets the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ichned.cz during October.
The absurdity that gets the most votes of the winners.
More than a hundred, more specifically 105 regulations and regulations that lack sense were applied to the survey this year.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, among the nominees there was a requirement that cars for the maintenance of motorways and express roads pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
This year's list of seven proposals is published on the competition page.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place at the Václav Square in Prague at the beginning of November, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in the personalities of political and social life.
For example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this competition this year.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws a stake at entrepreneurs' feet, therefore my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break a senseless regulation doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the company's obligation to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to travel with a stand for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed by a new trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007 which was notified by the Office of Labour as its foreign official for a service journey of up to 30 days was removed by the Green Card Act.
And a third of all good things.
An absurdity in 2009 became a regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two flat weights in the office.
This year the Ministry of Health decree was eased - the duty to have a refrigerator has fallen.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
It values ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year's new year's 5th edition of the Economic Newspaper Competition is a category called Responsible Company 2010.
The aim of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"This is how we want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is a announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the event of a competition for the rebel of the year.
Until this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company 2010 has registered companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would issue a separate article.
Although the subject matter of its activities differs in a geometric way, support and consideration can be considered as a common denominator for their efforts.
In one case, for example, it concerns disabled people and, elsewhere, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 republican finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company responsible from the Pardubic Region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor to the fund sponsoring disabled children for 17 years.
A paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 per cent of its disabled employees, is being taken care of and has therefore been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and has been placed in the region as a third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
On Olomouck, the accounting firm MirRiz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a relatively reduced salary.
The jury also gave her the title for buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explained delinquent Miloša Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ustec Region again thinks about the health of its employees and each notebook has got them ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its company events.
"In addition, we support the human distress foundation, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activities of Praní and cleaning from the Karlovar Region, which contributes to their pension additions in the form of superstandard bonuses.
"We are again giving contributions to food, transport, upgrading of qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal Construction Company Time, the winner of the Moravian Silesian Region.
In the category Responsible company of the year all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, the competitions The responsible company of the year could not take part, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose coordinating agency.
Police arrested the Land Fund in Plzeň in public competition
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen, anti-corruption police were arrested in the past days.
The Iron Detectives planted a local businessman in the media and a realtor with real estate Lubosi G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be awarded to specific bidders.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it, Luboshi G.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for breaking the fence in public procurement and in public competition," said the Law Chief of the Plzeň State Agency, Antonio Zelena, with further details regarding the ongoing investigation not to be provided.
Six-and-a-half-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum of official information, it is only possible to speculate about how he could have influenced public competition.
Speaker of the Land Fund of Lubomír Černá on question The Law stated that at a separate workplace in Pilsen the police actually arrested during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to the Black Competition, the right title is "The call for the transfer of land rights under the Land Act" and is held when more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution rights to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the buyers' order is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the highest bidder," the speaker explained.
Lubos G. apparently had information about who entered the call, and because he himself is also an eligible person, because he bought a number of restitution rights, he offered the applicants land that he would not participate in the competition.
He's probably incarcerated the retreat.
That would explain that he had so much money in custody.
Lubos G. had super-standard contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was in the custody of former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing in a substitute restitution land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been made.
It was then that Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival highway was to be built in the industrial zone of Borská Polje.
Later, he very conveniently traded them with a magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a value much higher.
That's when the city councilman had to come, because otherwise, by blocking the land, the building would be in danger.
Households are paid by hundreds per month for housing
Since January, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and waste, heat supplies and rents.
Families will thus have to withdraw from their wallets from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than they are now.
The electricity will sell up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and you will have to pay a tenth in some cities for water supplies and, for many reasons, it will also undermine the supply of central heat.
The electricity supply should be given to households in the apartments annually about the Stokoruna auctions as of now.
Power prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics.
Although the gas is slightly leaked, at a time when people are most melting and so consumed.
Therefore, each year it must also count with hundreds of additional crowns.
While electricity and gas flow across the Republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 kroner a month extra, more than 1000 kroner a year will pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are again threatened with being betrayed by more than 9 percent by water and waste, if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, the Fries will charge 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the Republic-wide comparison between the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, the water and livestock price is 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices may rise in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Apartment, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rent by up to a hundred percent from January.
Those who don't agree with the new rent are going to put the company in court.
Regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of style, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, especially a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks after which a drunkard who has not been 15 years is most likely to end up in the care of doctors.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the hospital’s children’s ward.
"Some beer or wine is completely out of style because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Trendem is certainly hard alcohol," said Luděk Pelikán, the legal primary of the children's department of Horůvice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"If they manage to get the bottle out of Dad's closet, it's whiskey, otherwise it's fair and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and then not feeling so much," the prime minister explained.
And for the truth, the speaker at Motol Eva Jurin's College Hospital is also giving him the truth.
"It's mostly fair or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases it was the plum which they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to the Prime Minister of Pelican, the 13 - year - old or 14 - year - old drunkards are a relatively common phenomenon in hospital income.
In front of Gorůvice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatrics in Motola, where ambulances tie down broken schoolchildren from around the world.
"There was a girl with us about four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per cent alcohol in the blood in addition to ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Holesovice for some dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother did not find it strange that she did not know about her daughter for 48 hours," the Prime Minister said.
It is not the parents ’ interest or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
However, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the right sense in children, according to experts.
"Alcoholics mean a multi-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case with children."
"In those who take alcohol repeatedly, there is more of a sign of unmanned family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelican.
According to the spokesman Jurin, about 40 drunken children were hospitalized at a pediatric clinic in Motola by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital would enter the statistics.
Children's drunkards who take their parents home after an ambulance or, if they're brought home by the police, don't count.
In addition to having children sit down after school and drink a bottle of beets, there are three seasonal fluctuations according to Pelican that can be relied on: the witch, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It's either the grief of bad testimony, or the celebration of the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I have experienced seven children's drunkards at the reception of witches at once," said Pelican.
The drunkard who spends the night of detoxification under the care of doctors is paradoxically advantageous to the one who suffers unpleasant hangovers at home the next day.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger induction infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it because they have a wonderful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing pains them."
"Only they are confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, sometimes they spoil patients' mood at least by calculating the costs of their treatment.
The transport of ambulances and hospitalization on an acute bed will also take tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education when I was counting directly on those children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to earn money for that one party," Pelican added.
However, health insurance companies do not, according to him, access to regressive procedures in which the cost of treatment would be incurred by parents.
Two L-159 aeroplanes are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159, out of a total of five aircraft, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to Sevilla, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It's the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been abroad for years.
It is a two-seat version of L-159T1, which has so far been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are uniform L-159.
You are currently standing booked in Aero Vodody and the broker of the shop - Omnipol - took over last week.
When the aircraft physically departs from Vododhod, according to Jan Pejšek of the press department of defense, it is not yet known.
"The L-159 fixed-wing aeroplanes for the exchange were separated from long-term fixed-wing aeroplanes, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"The two-digit L-159T1 have been changed in the current state and form," said Right Pejšek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft because the Ministry signed a contract with Aer in May 2009 worth 200 million kroons to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-stop machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS committed to deploying aircraft into the arms of an allied country.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft customer is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"There is therefore a matter of the customer how this thing will be implemented," said Pešek.
The economic newspaper said a while ago that, for example, the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirko Topolánka approved the exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the purchase of the tender and referred directly to the EADS.
The defence leadership at the time argued that it would support future exports of L-159.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a court appearance.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft was to be selected on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to arrive at the Prague airport Kbely within fourteen days.
Longer pointer than ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a index finger longer than a ring are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60 years old," said co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring.
The same probabilities of prostate cancer paid for them as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those with a index finger longer than a ring, however, this risk fell by 33 percent, with a drop of 87 percent for men in their 60 ’ s.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned - created in the prenatal period - appears to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone matches a longer index.
Earlier studies have shown that testosterone is the one that supports the growing prostate cancer.
Professor Václav Páès for ČTK, the leading Czech geneticist and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he knew about this study in general, but he did not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks lies mostly snow-driving, the passengers in many places ride all night.
The D5 motorway is closed between 89th and 93th km in the direction of Razvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands at D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (UAMK) said this to the news.
There was a truck crash at 90 miles, two trucks crashed at 93 kilometers, and an accident caused injury.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed in there.
Drivers should be driving right behind Brno at 90 km or crossing Brno and then driving at 182 km on Kyvalka.
There's a few kilometers of columns there.
There is also an accident on D11 highway, right next to the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a multi-centimeter layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are created on the Prosek, and Stírboholská is also blocked.
The most reliable means of transport is the subway.
Trams ride late, for example, on the track between Karl’s Square and the Square of Peace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Headquarters is due to meet again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
Czech roads have already had to cancel seven fast connections due to snow.
For example, problems have a track from Prague to Kralu or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from mid-town 11 hours a night to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already slippery, but only with increased caution.
On Vyškovska there are three roads that are impenetrable, snowy languages are formed in Brno, and some communications in the above snow chains are necessary in order to overcome them.
The most affected sites included Vyškovska.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milešovice.
They're going to have to put hairs on until they're stretched.
When they're passed through, there's no way to guess.
There is a need for caution in the area of White Carpathians in Hodonínsk.
On roads that are only maintained by inert spill for the protection of nature, the Czech Republic said that it is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of snow fell the most in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian Silesian region, there was about 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army has put on a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the Taliban conflict there and "change the game" in their favour.
A new weapon is kind of like a little super precise cannon.
Its missiles indicate a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special charges are 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive burst, actually functioning as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed by exploding not only at the impact of the target, but at any point in their ballistic tracks.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall, or in a burial ground.
Because the bottom is not usually protected, and when the deadly rain of steel shards falls on it, it can eliminate it from the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier deals with it in principle by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, so he gets a precise point of purpose, according to which he adjusts the intent and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun is loaded and the shot is fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audiette said.
Moved 400 jobs
The Fujitsu concert will move its branch from Bad Hamburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July of next year from the previous administrative building at the Marienbader-Sample in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Hamburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by a giant in the field specializing in computers and maintenance on Wednesday, he will move 400 men and women to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad, in July next year.
According to the speaker, there should be another 100 jobs of the company, which are so far distributed in the region, moving there in due course.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and large-space offices in Astro Park are more suited to the working way of employees.
In Bad Hamburg, too, Fujitsu was only hired.
Competent spokesman Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global society like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and the losers yesterday.
The head of the economic referee in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this managed to win a "global player".
It's "a fantastic expression of trust in this place."
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greenery), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed on time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of a computer manufacturer with a real estate renter on the Marienbader-namst.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
It is now a matter of preventing a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The House of Rathaus-Place, which had used Fujitsa so far, and the neighboring Kleine Verticale, were among the other buildings in Marienbader-Place in the city's most debated construction projects.
Between the station and the council, it was created as a joint project between the city and the private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticised for the massive construction of the areas which previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, a company of investment advice and credit rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the house as well as a computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was then connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Grouppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold after a year by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is described as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computer companies and servers available and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rýna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu’s employees are in Munich.
From Bad Hamburg moves to Frankfurt-Nederrad subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7,000 square meters.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the stellar landscape, which is twenty years old, is situated among others also the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down the server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks gets in tight.
Amazon's Internet service has turned off a discovery platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange reportedly lingers in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for discovery, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's search list, is scheduled to hold off on one newspaper post in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in a free country," activists reported on Wednesday's (local time) news on Twitter.
A short time ago, Amazon's Internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic dispatches to manage a high number of documents access.
With the help of Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this step: "Fine - our dollars are now spent by hiring people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers conducted a search, published CNN TV station on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step earlier, given the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries to avoid using servers.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, insolently and irrevocably, and thus our national security is exposed to danger and thus endangers life on the entire planet," the non-party senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in their efforts to spread stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
On the basis of a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard also knows the exact place.
An Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Speaking Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there have been threats.
"Even challenges to the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is legitimately worried about his safety, said Haffnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Haffnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the responsible person to be released to Wikileaks for treason and execution.
In Canada said on TV one of the government's advisors Stephen Harper - apparently ironic, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use "target plane".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal shootout between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's speaker, Robert Gibbs, called it "funny and absurd" that Assange requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently published espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The special task force was appointed as the representative of the director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of the messages from the delegation to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put at risk for publication on Wikileaks.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said Foreign Minister Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
University of Ice cream
The "Gelato University" at Bologna is preparing ice cream confectioners for a better annual period.
The basic course for a future ice cream maker, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from anyway?
From Gelatiera and Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes ice cream from the icebox, wipes it in the lining and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
However, who wants to know more about ice cream, they do not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003 he established an ice cream-cream-making university to match the high Italian ideals of ice-cream machines everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, special courses on chocolate ice cream and the practice in its own ice cream shop are also offered for several days.
Someone longs for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's household came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during her training on the South and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then this includes a note of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano will put the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which will heat everything with an electronic program of 85 degrees and then cool immediately to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a rooster and emerges pasteurised white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the doctor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns you to be carried away by spirit until unknown.
Whoever talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" apparently also used stabilisers - mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will have ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano differs from the flavor of ice cream to the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweet department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basic matter that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa based on all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now he's allowed to take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them produce always four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lollipop ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base matter, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity mashed potatoes - because of the taste it is not always better.
Nutmeg ice cream may not taste more nutmeg when it contains more nutmeg.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only after a balanced mixture raises the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numbering task: If peach mashed potatoes are used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
A lemon ice cream needs extra sugar.
Luciano removes the device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (winners measure the must of grapes).
Fortunately, the tables ease the numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only does the machine support the automatic production of basic material.
There is also a device that simultaneously washes the finished ice cream mixture into cream and cools it down to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we do not avoid minor accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit mashed potatoes when he loses control of the huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Double-light auditors
The European Food Authority of EFSA is associated with an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been made by a group of testiotech experts who are considered to be an independent institute for the estimation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," the head of Testiotech Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The leaders of the EFSA Group of Specialists on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts have had a contract with the Ilsi Association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the control rules of the EFSA for genetic plants and thus stands in clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
It is said that the provisions of EFSA are in line with the Ilsi documents throughout the paragraphs and bear the handwriting of the industry which should be controlled by the Italian Parma Authority.
This is the second time Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior executive from the Efs passed without any additions or transitional time to the Swiss immigration company Syngenta - thus changed sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently unveiled the EU's staff connection to control the industrial lobby, which has aroused interest both in the Ministry of the Environment and in EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize the conflict of interest.
It deals with all serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are of high quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFs are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - except for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts like Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that no response from genetic plants to the environmental effects is being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn in the field will do," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If there are no risks, how would it be possible to find them?" he asks the defendant, Then.
Angelica Hilbeck agrees.
A science worker has been studying genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists as well as in the US, and now in Europe too.
That's why there are almost no scientists who would not be connected to the companies anymore.
Most studies are not published that are critical to society.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also acquired some, about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: In September the swamps came and began to tear a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Don't let it disappear."
It bursts out, "Silent and poor stone, simple and original."
When one of them cut out, he smelled like smoke.
What he's gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen at the former French Army ammunition dump, where Manuel Rogen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were created during the Stuttgart crash.
"It would be a shame if they split into gravel or disappeared into a dump," she says in her office, a wooden booth that was formerly a guard's house.
He's told that he was being bullied and threatened when in September all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the North Wing from a company that was doing demolitions.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition.
And when that happens, it's the most reasonable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then he took about 200 S-21-opposers each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some are also hoping to return it when it is rebuilt.
Rogen bought 500 tons, cargo 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, builders of the house.
They came from all over the place and pulled what was in the trunk and onto the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long been transformed into "walls" or the edges of the plant ranges.
"This rock is not really anything special," says Rogen.
"If it wasn't for the political push."
He's getting into his field car and he's going for a ride through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, stopped studying later on in biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40,000 tons of stones in it.
They bind their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
It's slowing down.
In the snow lies artificially worked sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Marian Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sand from Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite rock."
We're still on our way up through the woods.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
Once there were those quads on the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Canstatt-travertin from the police bureau in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuff from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were broken by hand and transported by means of simple racks and bulls, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like that was crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
But today, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stones, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassman, and one gardener settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the judge.
He has to go to Cologne in due course.
Stones will also be saved there.
High-potential talent fight
There's a lot of people at the diner.
16 students are pressed for bread with salmon, tomato soup and sweetness.
The University of Technology in Braunschweig and the manufacturer of cars Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with VW developers here, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and by the way, just get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to compete with the smartest heads, as well as the company VW, to succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums before they reach the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities don't issue any lists of their students' success, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects focused on practice and get them.
At TU Braunschweig is trying to get a car company to get talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department handes out pens, rubber bears and boards with a VW logo.
They tell promising young talent about practical programs, student jobs and suggest a trip to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project along with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who might be useful as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Sella, is not uncommon.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting for his students.
"Otherwise, it was a major professional project," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably get harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long-term candidates.
On the contrary, they must strive to attract especially highly qualified workers.
First of all, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineers Association, the VDI remained unoccupied in October with 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the predictions of the VDI, the lack of engineers will continue to grow.
The audit and consulting firm KPMG is followed by Roman Dykta for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising U.S. students next year.
Participants can also check the KPMG branches and meet the company.
In advance, he will decide in two selection cycles who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème of many interested people will fly to the USA.
In the high-potentials fight at the universities, they'll pay more and more laws according to the Dicta.
"We want to be different from the rest of the race."
"The one-time boat trip was too little for us."
Looks like the Dicta talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for work with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies are presented in the traditional labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional exhibitions."
"Like the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 posts listed on the company's website.
"At present, it's just complicated, to occupy your seats."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another possibility is through professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist doesn't organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"The big companies often cannot offer it," says the head of the Stübe personal department.
For a long time, money has not played a key role in the search for work.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good practice are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study at the Great Place Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, fellow workers are asked how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and monitor the framework conditions of employees.
The head of Stübe's personal department hopes that her placement will bring points to the job seekers.
"I believe that the applicants are particularly informed about external evaluations of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employee Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be visible as an attractive employer leads through its own employees," he says.
This is called the internal Emproyer Branding, which is the enforcement of an employer on the market within his own employees.
"Satisfying employees are the best emissaries."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise to their employer between friends and friends.
"It's like a rope game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops the new oil wells
Over the next few years, there will be no new oil wells on the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued an appropriate ban - thus invalidating earlier plans.
Also, new drilling sites are banned from the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar reported it Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the worst environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the opposition and industry's pressure to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf.
Opponents try to reduce US dependence on supplies of oil from abroad.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of applications.
The Commission of Inquiry entrusted to Obama should present the results in December.
In October, the interior minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill ban he had been paying since the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil companies applied for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, there is a fundamental reform of the control office, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would eliminate the lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil in the bay.
"Governmental plans are the biggest barrier to the growth of the gas and oil industry", the result of an ongoing survey in the field by the BDO consulting firm - before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance still complains of uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change regulation."
Investments in new mining projects are moving until the appeal - at the expense of growth.
The area of Ogoni burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of liquid oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live with stealing, corruption, and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist calms down: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy who wanders through the chest of water surrounded by smudges: the scene acts in a watery shine with rainbow colors almost nicely.
There is no evidence of brown oil colliding beneath the surface.
She used to collect enough pots here, reports Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, it became slowly flowing water completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil was poured into a huge wet area from the broken management.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must sail for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, belongs to one of the worst-infested areas in the world.
The entire range of launches is only known on the route along the river with many side inflows.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of light water with brown porridge and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out his oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves stick out of the ground like black sticks of liquorice, rarely the palms that occur leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are in vain looking for flocks of birds that are usually found in wet areas: Once the engine is shut up on the boat, it will disperse in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, terrifying silence.
"What's going on here is the ecological leadership of the war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first European conquerors came here, here in the 1980s they formed the first resistance with a later executed writer Ken Sara-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
Until today, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it is daily seized from the whole area of the delta with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of lead over two million barrels of black gold, there is an oil field in the Ogoni area of the ladyma, the situation is too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred meters, they stick from the water of steel construction like bizarre statues: "Christmas Trees", so they are called too gently the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the sea.
At any moment, the head of the drilling hole breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant flow of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres in 50 years have leaked into the ecosystem in the delta: every year the amount of oil that leaked into the sea at Alaska during the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker accident 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell Group refers to sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists speak of the cracking heads of drilling and nearby waters as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the US-American scientist Richard Steiner lamented: Only the number of water disorders is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far from abandoned, oil-defiled workshop under the wide sky, it emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by lead, partially distributed on the ground, fire burns: illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up over the fire for several hours in a barrel, explains Michael, the group leader.
First it emerges from the lead into the catchable pot of gasoline, later drips at the end of the kerosene management and eventually oil.
In this way Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels a day, after 300 liters: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state in Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still be exceeded by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to the lead everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the entire Niger Delta region loses at least 16 million litres of oil a day.
But only a negligiblely small part of the well-preserved raw material will be illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, which include politics and the high position of army representatives, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether the people caused the disaster and their interventions or the easy way to produce it is considered purely academic by the Akpobari activist.
"If oil companies weren't considered intruders, and if they hadn't completely destroyed the livelihood of fishermen, then there would have been neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that it is only considering the departure of the group: "Perhaps other nations will show up as the Chinese as better."
Michael's gonna be upset.
"It's high time for you to disappear," says the muscle manufacturer.
"At any moment, the soldiers can come."
If they were found by a special military unit, they would not be threatened with prison, but with a painful payoff.
Soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from raw materials.
"This cursed thing has got our land all the way to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 appears to have a major security malfunction.
Investigators found a possible construction error during a search of a machine that accidentally landed, which could lead to a "catastrophal engine failure".
Qantas Air Force wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of Qantas Airbus were likely more fortunate at the start of November than was known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority discovered in its investigations a major safety malfunction on the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning against a possible construction error.
Perhaps the defect would have serious consequences: one oil connection could create cracks due to wear and tear, this Thursday in a published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "caustrophal engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 planes.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land urgently in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She lodged a complaint with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against that company.
Qantas's boss, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the nasal surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aeroplanes equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman atsb Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiencies were considered important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa swapped one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-story plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snow will cause chaos in transport
Germany all in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There's chaos, connections between trains and planes on many roads.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: almost the whole republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east lie some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several highways and many roads there is a very limited right.
At A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it was not able to handle the newly snowed snow.
In addition, there was a strong impacting wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Shipping and Hydrography Office (BSH) is expecting a stormstorm of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic Sea in Schlesvik-Holštynsk in the morning.
Snowfalls caused considerable problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the bad weather center, Meteomedia was therefore the highest level of alarm in Saxon Switzerland.
Part of it attacked 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the winds.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road problems.
A2 was caused by wind and snow slow traffic and congestion.
There was trouble in Durinsk because of the snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German track, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsk, Durinsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and bends.
Remote traffic must have been stopped in Saxony from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Duryn, Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers got on the train from firefighters and rescuers of wool blankets, food and drink.
The snow wind was blowing across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at large German airports due to snow winds.
According to the spokesperson, the flight information centre has already been reported from Munich's cancelled flights.
In Frankfurt, our Mohan has been cancelled for 40 years, according to the spokesman for Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Even though there are few passengers left without connections at the airport, 400 beds are prepared for them.
There have been accidents on many roads since Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a train crossing in eastern Holshtynsk.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Because of the snow road there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreutha to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
And then one 30-year-old woman died after turning around at Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light dust, and that is why it will rise even when the wind is light.
But the wind will wane.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of wind power.
But it's going to be a big winter - local to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for towers-doubles
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye to his sign: according to one newspaper report, the buyer's bank is looking for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could amount to up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: towers-doubles in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernising; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now he obviously wants the financial firm's renovation costs back - and he's looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, according to Financial Times Deutschland, with a reference to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it is more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This brings again the largest credit institution in Germany after a short period of time to give up its corporate residence.
The Bank took over the towers-twins only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them in a cost-effective manner.
The energy conversion accounted for around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the newly renamed towers to "Greentowers" according to the newspaper text at a price of around 500 million euros.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the assets of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the monument of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the bottom.
Still, it has not been possible to free the dead because the safety situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a strong explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the bottom.
In the shaft where the accident occurred, a probe was launched, but it did not reveal any sign of life.
Because of the high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, authorities and experts came from the fact that miners no longer stand a chance of survival.
Still couldn't get the dead out.
Now they have honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, tens of thousands of people gathered on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They've been silent for two minutes.
29 tables, including helmets, lamps, and miners’ names, were built to honor the monument of the buried miners.
Images and personal items, such as clothes and surfboards, have found their place here.
There were flags half-naked on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out again from "the depths of the country" to the surface, Minister John Key told the participants of the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say good-bye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Laurie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the bottom.
A number of foreign diplomats also participated in the memorial events except for the Prime Minister and related victims.
British and South African miners also collapsed during the November 19th explosion.
Rescuers started by lighting fires inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the toxic gases dissolve, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside the bottom, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is horror fit for an art theater?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old borders again with his battle epoch "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean when he was shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be freed from his tormentors and kill in large numbers with almost supernatural force his opponents - it sounds perfect for young male viewers who seek bloody action because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and his enemies even chews the guts out of his belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as it is called, does not say a word throughout the entire film, and the other figures will carry at least one or two sentences or are being cast into passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and warms up in the dreadfully beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very calm camera recordings.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winging Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantina, but stoki prevents his works from getting closer to either the humor of the main stream or the less brutal art audience.
Most supporters of the art cinema are likely to be discouraged by the spraying of brains and interiors everywhere.
The supporters of action films will be bored at the latest at the moment when One-Eye is released for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries sailing to Jerusalem and will remain hanging forever in the wind and in the fog, before the team apparently joins America and continues silent there.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Germany "Wallalla Rising" did not get into the movies and was now released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the special facade, the places until the blood clot, it hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or precise history, it's all about the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a viewer to escape.
Refn doesn't even give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his cold shots and his cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the indescribable hatred of character.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-Eyed keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, who will become time for enemies and transitional allies as a warrior of hell, perhaps as an envoy of the devil.
It creates destruction, perhaps, but also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new alert on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, prevents expression - and does not even allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saure.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), its name appears when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this area hidden in a valley that is turning away from the current.
On the basis of the US-US Foreign Secret Service communication of late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of El-Kibar, would have been well placed to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The technique of the '50s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
With computer animation it explained where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, it is intended to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, photographs were presented that showed the building close to or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before launch, but without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years of bombing, there is little more to know than then, even time-controversy has increased.
Former US President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building an El-Kibar reactor, but basically had no basis for "active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some Secret Service rapporteurs in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of "the alleged reactor", even though the CIA's presentation is considered "trustworthy".
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he is that he has a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA said he has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The alleged "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the ground.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 the IAEA team was managed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in El-Kibar to track the uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received, through a Member State, satellite photographs of commercial sellers from a time immediately after the attack, which should be more prestigious than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program or even built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But that's what the IAEA turned out to be after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters - as well as satellite images.
In addition, it prohibited the auditors of the second inspection in El-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombarded building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment," confirmed an official opinion at the time, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without delay and is "increasing to a serious problem due to the credibility of the Authority", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - it is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty to which the IAEA monitors.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter to be the other three devices that are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
However, the auditors have not yet indicated which equipment they are dealing with or what their function is or why they are suspected of.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung's newspaper, the IAEA internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again based on nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - this is precisely why Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three sites.
In Vienna it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent to search for military bases in advance.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the device by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has the background and satellite images that between these three places and the square at Euphrates, the material was transported here and there.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one arrangement should be "in relation to the production of fuel".
But there is no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where does the uranium come from and where plutonium should be removed from the bomb later, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important traces is stored in these three places.
It's like they're disappearing from the surface of a hundred freight cars, no one seems to have any information on where that shit came from.
Only a few kilometres away from El-Kibar away and on the other side of Euphrates lies the salt mine al-Tibni, which let Syria check in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with a reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected groundwork sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows the great interest of the auditors.
In the meantime, Damascus rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna have calmed down a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, which is why it is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about what is called special inspections, one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of the "opportunity to which I am staying away in the future", but he is hesitant.
This choice poses a great risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love during Wartime
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unnamed directorate in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known - but it also causes restlessness.
It is said that the Muslim woman will fall in love with the Serb man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary moved rapidly.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN-Organization to assist UNHCR refugees Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informing the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the UN-Organization ambassador to help refugees.
She is not very diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where she was raped, love stories did not materialize, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals much about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN-Organization should assist the refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian informs.
What exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosniak Ministry of Culture, which received a reading of its script, allowed for smaller pullovers in Sarajevo's shooting - it is not clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author points out that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved space.
Given its content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war started and meet again when she is like a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "a rape victim will fall in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her, which "is not fair and is based on false information".
Now they can free her from the Hollywood hackers by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
It's good for Iry again this evening.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans cry out with joy for the sound of loud music, with their butt legs.
Bailey-Pub in South York's Cork is boiling because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit.
"The Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to fly to Las Vegas for the world championship in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and a restrained IT guy, it doesn't work out very well together.
Yet he tries to entertain a 26-year-old man, to respond to the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, he's going to a New Zealand interview in January.
"It makes me feel so weird," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "at once got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of their bad prospects at home, they've tried their luck abroad for two of Tanner's three siblings.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
Boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners look like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in due course, predicted by experts at the scientific institute for economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, it is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar migratory wave suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise that has brought great prosperity to the Irish people, dissatisfaction is now growing again.
The economic crisis is particularly affecting young, educated Ira, who have only experienced a rise so far.
Loss of employment and social downturn seemed absurd these years.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, there are three out of ten women and men under 30 without a job.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything comes from the hills."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our land loses its whole generation."
"The last one, please turn it off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government only cheats and young people offer no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," the 20-year-old said.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out by herself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market is work abroad an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are pictures of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something else, he's known Sean O'Donovan for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts so he can pay home the house loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time it crosses the threshold of its own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I'm not really at all."
She laughs in despair and walks in cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 per cent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he worried it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have kids I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen -- maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep the future open and just wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He's also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one other thing that bothers him enough these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn into a bachelor party.
"No emotion at all," he says, "and he'll have a good beer."
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it the departure party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Normal practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarometer, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in positions across the whole area.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific has increased significantly in South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are democratic beliefs, which takes the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but compared to the year 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
About 34% said they trusted the House in their country and 45% trusted the government, again it was the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, she undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support was probably generated during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased to 32% this year.)
But the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luly da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime worsened.
For the second time since the survey began, more respondents across Latin America have seen crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see figure 5).
About 31% say that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decline compared to 38% of last year's data and is also the lowest since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9% compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential country in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela is looking forward to success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criterioned Elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on November 28th to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
The elections were filled with urns and repetitive ballots, ballots scattered through channels, broken election rooms and intimidation.
Election room opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several alleged forerunners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the abolition of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that "in many respects it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have said cautiously that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestine, is scheduled to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is identified by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive match.
Due to a controlled cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that election participation would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization they were prevented.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards that are necessary for the vote remain unsplit shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, then, that the Haitians will plant themselves for it.
After the tops to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentine President, from sympathy to the public, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term in the elections next year may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives up her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income according to their preferences.
The government of Mrs. Fernández lost most of it in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement of Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (at which the government was being slapped and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to pretend," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the President spending more space according to his will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to increase to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 111%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about a figure that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina narrowed down the economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned up INDIC, a statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now temper this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade unions.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has disrupted growth based on major devaluations in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is letting her know that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government created an agreement with bondholders who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Madam President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments that are assembled in the Paris Club, which owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be monitored by the IMF as usual.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer price index, which would be a reminder of the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office, when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of a middle class that is tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be falling.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to give up the many views her husband had in politics.
Half-encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, elected the mayor and council of the city on 27 November in five urban districts, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma is himself a representative of the feelings that predominate towards the mainland and have been strongly placed in business relations, including the agreement on partially free trade, in the highest level of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but only closely.
Although his side of Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the mayor's five offices, it was unable to win by majority.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favours greater independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The elections took place as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include loud election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with slowly dressed girls.
Part of it was even a covert assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, was aspiring for KMT candidates on electoral night.
The man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien right across the face, wounded him and killed the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the armed man intended to harm Mr Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any event, Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps China was the only major winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates turned their backs on plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT therefore has a tendency to avoid being linked to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also dropped from triggering anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma confirmed, for his part, that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to pay commercially, together with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Surely they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP party has discovered itself in any case.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a storm and a champion of clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was summoned as DPP's candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held an office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their actions could take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her side is a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's ratings were bad, despite the excessive pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go on a campaign with him.
Its disfavor seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he's reorganizing his office, just like the local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy Award Nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
A statement at the request of the President and the people must be legally noted.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer, whom President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is referred to as one of the surprises of Grammy's awards this year with a nomination in the category of best new artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her "Esperanza" album was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy's rules, when an artist cannot release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" has certainly recorded a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and her deep hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for voters in Grammy, who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy jury rightly appreciates the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a snarky New Orleans favorite and a frequent HBO guest "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large files when the Chamber Jazz Children Ensemble stood in competition and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bass player can have a free hand as a band.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Classic music nominations have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy prices.
The lead position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" as a piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with a link in South California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work commissioned through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolyn Concerto also has a chance to award.
The nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergies Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appasionamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered in Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute paper specifically for the Mandoline interpreter Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tone from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for leading Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsky's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class of the transition classics she won the nomination of soprano Jesse Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on a Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre at Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose only shout loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time discussions with people who were in favour or against the centre took place.
The discussion continued on the news website.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We're a planet of monkeys with a Statue of Liberty falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the scene of a tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, which reads about 135 families, mourned in Riverside County for years without incident, but wished for more and more suitable space than the storage space that he had rented together with the manufacturer of filter systems.
The new mosque with dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet.
It should cover a space of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the space to search for new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered to be fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is some form of real 'foreign' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
Scientists have found, however, that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"It will start to surprise you as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news published to be discussed, which did not reveal the details of the finding, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report revealed the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbial exposed to both elements could be substituted for each other.
"Arsen is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"Nothing else is arsenic so different that as phosphorus does not work. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is used, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacements, the possibility is increased that the life form that uses arsenic can appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a specialist in microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that he could have been used in earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just in the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found informed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
Four exhibit dogs - two akits and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities reported.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs were then on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to tell us exactly where the dogs were found, in which location, and did not share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, weren't arrested to make their case.
They were delighted to have their two akits found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akita Trace, Trace's three-year-old dog and Didi's ten-month-old female, were unharmed, reported by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate in this week's regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop at almost a month's travel steam after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the window of the room.
They also took three dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a betanian hare - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit to keep the dogs fresh enough air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a carjacking at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who leads them to missing dogs, dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the prices would be awarded.
The lion is once again ready to scream now that the restructuring of the MGM has obtained final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start again.
On Thursday, a federal insolvency judge in New York officially blessed the "front-packed" creditors' plan to settle about $5 billion in debt and thus clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
The fourth income that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. audition rules does not leave MGM with any legal obstacles so that they can restart the founders Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the shrunk study.
The number of employees drops to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM does not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources to allow a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's about connecting with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
On August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron, and an expert on turnover, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to give the company for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds that creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements the plan was finally approved by the creditor in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from the audition in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multimillion dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which incarcerate for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production in MGM, which this year released only one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released early in 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films that will feature the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, sought to merge the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not enter into an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your budget on gifts balanced
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five wheels of BMX for 99 dollars and one game of Kinect costs as much as 10 beads or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts balanced.
I recently visited three national toy salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law worked; this year's technological toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to the previous years.
While there are relatively fewer new toys with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the toy with battery chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices mentioned are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
At one push, the animal will produce a tone and the second squeeze will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start hitting, you cannot stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animation doll from Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel-locking.
The kids are testing Mickey's dance instructor toy, although their parents are complaining about a lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the '80s, you might remember Alpha, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn car driving into fun with self-repaired, funny workbook.
If you're going crazy on your kid's smartphone, there's three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest option with easy-to-use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective learning as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than a lighter box, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competition in the improvised form of words.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the greatest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits at Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include, like, roller skates or Puffle's animal.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush brush brush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest of a series of microbots on a button battery.
The bug moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze of dice and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of a gentler police check in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, scrutinized his orders and issued orders in a loud voice with military authority.
He wanted women members - Chinese permanent enforcers of urban order, fearful and despised for their hard work and lust for violence - to make a certain impression on the noise of the residents.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering silently, "What pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants were alert.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the ruler.
Four headgears perfectly sit on hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr Tang contemptuously.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered new goalkeepers to have higher education.
Guangdong Province has changed its gray-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced his views on heavy weapons: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers had placed their cart with snacks unrelentingly and looked intently at the owner when the suspect seller packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen surgery as their main image.
Since 2003, the district has complemented its city police with 13 women who have been specifically selected according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show, apart from the gross side of the police, the gentler, the female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city's decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat a non-participated viewer to death after using his cell phone to record how they were taking action in protest against the landfill.
Last year, police training in Beijing took place, and the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual was a description of how to effectively beat the offender without blood.
This year, a suspect dealer with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police attacking a street vendor.
" Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, a national edition, complained last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that this approach is not enough.
After the district announced interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial of The Beijing Evening News asked whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The period required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the diameter - that is higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials claim that work is mentally too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"Candidants must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City, disagrees very much with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like the requirement for proportional facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Health or malaise will certainly not be applied.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchback to serve with us," said Mr Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a guard at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think that emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist effect, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her coworker with the bottoms, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just to drive traders into alleys where they can carry out their activities.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on bicycles and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times already!" said Miss Xu when the marketer started running, and for a time he left his bicycle with a noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day it is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts to confiscate the goods.
They can only threaten to report this fact to their male leader.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumours of police killing the sellers spread.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were turned over or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed barely.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police patrols were held that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could have cried the way he wanted.
15 minutes distance in front of the cops, face-to-face, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the co-ordinators are men over 40 years old who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and ironing images.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said in real life.
"Most of the time, it's a public that starts with it."
The prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges concerning his affair with the former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, lawyers announced to the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the Nebadian republican, faced and which, until the time of the scandal, was regarded as a possible Republican candidate for president for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that the decision that followed almost a year's investigation "was certainly a pleasure".
The senator could still face disciplinary action with the Senate's ethics commission.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that he is not planning to press any further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Mr Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer at Ensign's campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently Mr Ensign's assistant, he was expelled from the law from lobbying by his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were friends prior to the affair, appeared contrary to the prohibition of lobbying.
From the evidence that was published "it turned out that it was a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics said that the Ministry was careful with regard to political lawsuits after a large number of irregularities, including the decision last year to suspend the action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of the charges of doubt by the State Attorney's Office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign.
"It shows essentially that the laws do not apply to high-ranking government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief lawyer, told him in the interview that he had received a call Monday from the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice and then the following day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defence team is working with the plaintiffs to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a central statement, "was acting in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the state's representatives.
"I am not pleased to describe the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint, in which the ethical group charged that Ensign Hampton's parents' payment to the 96,000 dollars violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that there was insufficient evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main non-VAD company that supported the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr Hampton became a lobbyist in society, Mr Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - had communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that he had "dried" to the Ministry of the Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton for lobbyist work.
When the affair report first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In a report that Mr Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the crime, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethical commission would quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
The challenge of the village of Cheshire turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom.
Within minutes, they were sending reports of a terrible witness on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports dealt with the rape and tethering of children to beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes was re-examined for killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and an official end was to be made to the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would probably have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - has created a "Circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disturbing details has then introduced the jury in its decision-making sense by public opinion.
This claim could lead the judge to question whether new rules in the courtroom should also be required with regard to the arrival of new technologies.
"As I have seen in this review, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ulmann, Mr Hayes's chief defence attorney.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim concerning the yield of last week and the fact that the media were "well controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognised that reporting on known cases may raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, in the case of Sheppard, it was a "carneval atmosphere" due to the media.
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration for the TV show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that reviewed Hayes's half-century sentence might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that limiting direct communication towards the courts can make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of many shadowed lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
For example, the lawyers argue that in the case of Mr Hayes, it may be preoccupation when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photographs of terror in the selection of a jury.
Some of the jurors said that they were appalled by photographs of the victims who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The lawyers argue that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury who was critical of the state's representatives and wrongly put more pressure on the verdict by its decision and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
Jurors weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to last month's verdict that the case dominated reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by a candidate for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media constantly fanned the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the direct reporting was more disturbing than the reports mentioned later and that the judicial police should be able to manage the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adjustment of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Dr Sheppard's judgment, because of the wide scope of the trial and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its insult and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is it the first owner of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to the battle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and Parliamentary leaders did not bring any fundamental findings on the key topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any event, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party hunting.
The mid-term public meeting of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that for several months, close collaboration has built mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that it still divides.
And it's kind of awkward to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period - they are investigating each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, seeking to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's proceedings and its subsequent evaluation of the participants were carried out with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the ratios that have been in place for the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
The elections aroused the emotions of the pagers, and then they shut up.
It's okay."
On several issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts ended at the end of the year, and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the republicans cannot see how they support tax cuts for the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
Following Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already a greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new start-up treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress is called for January.
Rather, it is likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is to a large extent widespread - in that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and the year 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the construction of a new republican majority in the White House and the choice of tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of being magnified, knowing that they must act in line with their promises and must reduce government spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These lines of accession are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on deficits, which include reform of the tax code and increased certain taxes, increased retirement age and reduced expenditure.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, developed pressure on deficit issues to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18th member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close to this number as possible.
The biggest opposition is between elected officials in the jury who propose that, in the case of financial matters, we have, at least today, small bases or wills for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first starts next year in the form of party conflicts, when the Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What's the cause of the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partyism in the last election, most Americans want to continue to see the two sides that work together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very careful to monitor public reactions.
Whoever is at risk of losing their votes will probably change the course and seek compromise.
That may be an optimistic view of the matter.
Foreignness and direction are now greater than it was in the mid-1990s and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of the republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
An American document depicts Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it continues part of the bribes and security fees that come on the way to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been modified.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accused him of a large proportion of corruption.
He was called off in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in clearance.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company, have for many years consistently denied the charges of corruption, and won several charges for false charges for such a complaint.
In September, he said to a Russian television station when he was asked about a proven witness to corruption, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will show up for the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details expressed in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of that they would do so by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with criminal animals have led some to call it 'disfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more as a kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are looking forward to the so-called 'krysha' (the term from the criminal and mafia world, which literally means 'top' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of the State Attorney, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"The analysts also identified a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on second-degree."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in certain areas, since some services are not provided by the city."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "trade owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (more than from organised criminal groups), because they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while money selection is complex, protection itself may already have problems; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay fast enough are closed under different circumstances.
The bear spoke several times of fighting corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably inflatable cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no longer part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that Russia’s corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (the countries are at least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of a report by the American Embassy which appeared in Moscow in the late evenings certainly did not arouse enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Moscow's shortcomings could be blamed for Luzhkov, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
During his interview with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and reacted in anger to the statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a dispute over lit concrete classrooms with dirty and broken walls, the school director Anlong Veng High School reminded her of the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for its cruelty during the Red Khmer government, the commander remains in this remote state of the Red Khmer in northwestern Cambodia a popular one, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, it is also a broken long-term loyalty in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victim in the forum of truth and reconciliation was allowed to face publicly the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Red Khmerians and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will jointly pass the first conviction of the former Red Khmer member, the sentencing of a former leader, the notorious Tuol Slang violent association, the Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, there was a growing unrest between the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"Among the former Red Khmer Rouge is anger and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organisation that examines the regime.
"To them, the life between the Khmer Rouge was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Government of the Red Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved, sick or reworked.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrowed the Pol Pot government in 1979, the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were driving partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer warriors began to move to the government that culminated in the 1996 Ieng Sara surrender in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their monks no longer cared for them, most former Red Khmer warriors fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Red Khmerians held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"The Mok has consumed all of them."
"But now life is hard, because we must ensure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Red Khmer court has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Kheeu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a matter of calming down the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey during the Red Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent steaming evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared through the drained grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court called her in, she'd refuse to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there's another prosecution, there'll be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran away from the Red Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought further suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"A reconciliation in Khmer terms means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre published the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, has 75 pages and the title "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng also knew little about the Red Khmer, despite the connection between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, textbooks and court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Red Khmers still have a strong spell here.
Up in the mountains, Dangrek Mountains is a weed-in-the-mould road, and it is filled with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black ponds, covered with a stainless sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pot here was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that its uranium-based weapons supply appears
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would surrender their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Security Summit of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martyn.
Over the years, the American government has tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and it seems that the stone was hit last spring.
But US officials have told The Washington Post that a number of undercover operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for a central agreement to remove the remainder of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Summit on Nuclear Safety in April, in which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide for up to four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so for George W. Bush's administration.
During Obama’s summit on nuclear safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our Commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train, which traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and liquidation facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, endeavour to dispose of its stocks by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But the central statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't work with CIA flights of jewels.
The Spanish government did not make any valuables on CIA flights of prisoners of Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánama via Spanish territory, as a United States envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
This results from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, which also states that the then first representative of Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus demonstrate that she has the proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying the Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, following a Communication from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of co-infringing human rights, a meeting was held between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre of the United States and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said that the Council of Europe's message "has taken Zapater's government out of the picture" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "incapacitated", Aguirre reported in one of the documents.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the US Ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as little detail as possible, but that this matter was in the hands of the judges, and that the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Centre for Secret Services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated component or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns rather about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the disclosure of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly among governments," Aguirre regrets.
On the occasion of the lunch of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba in March 2007, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid angry comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party's conduct, Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - poz.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the party of Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States' actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
A confessed murderous mother complained about a network of maternal "ages"
A young woman talked about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki."
With this nickname, which she used from an early age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; the two are from the village of Noia in La Corunya, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
For them to understand, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of her family members’ testimony.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let her run a DNA test.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame.
Their association took a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl left for the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone on Menorce, and she says, "Alberto's upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with the kid all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm supposed to send you the baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving my baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May he talks about his return to his home: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until 19th, because 20 I have to go to work so that I don't lose this place."
He explains that if things go well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be with, i.e. me, and it'll never happen again in my life that I leave him with anyone other than my mother," a questionable intention given her bad relations.
There's another paper in July.
When he types out this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other."
"He's with me on the one hand, and he likes it pretty much here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"I'm going to go to summer school, and I'm going to save some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Cesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what email videos he wants, see how he wants it, meet me, sex is needed."
On the 30th, another message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner, "Gives me money."
On the Internet are Monique's contributions on blogs dedicated to anime and manza.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Muki ex-con."
"Terror by Galician (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Provincial Penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention centre on Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "that she didn't intend to hurt the kid somehow."
Before, however, she admitted that she drowned César in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The defense and the D.A. require psychiatric examination.
The people would have gained 4 seats and PSC in Parliament (Socialist Party of Catalonia - Poznad.) would have lost 9 mandates
With the results of November 28th, the PP party could have the main word on the council in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - poz.) already has an idea of general elections, whether it comes up or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually the same as those of the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610.473 votes in the general elections, while in the 2006 Autonomous elections this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend, supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, was maintained, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to take place, the PPC could gain 12 members in Parliament against the existing 8, the CIU (Convergence and Union, Czech Consent and Union - Later) would also receive 4 mandates (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is crucial to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC party (Levic Republic Party of Catalánska - Poznadz.) would lose one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - Poznad.) would continue to have one mandate, or if it would have received another one.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest deployment will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where the people could also have a decisive impact on the end of the Socialist domination in the four main provinces, as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose its city council in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Geronna, where the Socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ECC parties and the ICV.
In view of the republican debacle, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona office - since at least 5% of the votes needed to be obtained.
PP increased the number of votes obtained in the four capitals and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turn in Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP side before the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ross has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Other important councillors, such as Badalona, Castelldeels, and Reus, were also awarded by the people.
The PP currently has 34 councillors in Catalánsk and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al-Qaida with thousands of passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were arrested in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian, who were arrested by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaida, including "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", with the second designated group authoring assassinations in Bombay, with 106 dead in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of Al-Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at international level and "limiting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand in two years when it was active in Catalan, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida so that their "warlords" could travel unpunishedly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active Jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were involved in these investigations other than Thai services, and it cannot be excluded that in the following days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, such as last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another developed in Thailand, with Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Syrikanlaya Kiybumrrung.
It was these men who drove a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, whose part was dismantled in 2009, in particular stole passports from tourists who met Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and had to be visa-free.
The investigation documents stress that no facts are yet known that would link the arrests from Catalonia to the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency about $1,000, which were "invested" in the purchase of cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is asking Maso to stop the fiscal agreement
PPC Party President Alicia Sánchez-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to present to Arthur Maso herself the conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as President of the General Assembly; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and abandon risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wishes to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at a meeting with Arthur Mas with the assurance of 18 parliamentary seats received in the elections of last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for gaining a taste, and therefore the CIU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain from voting on his appointment to the office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far the discussions that are taking place in these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for the President of the PP, in order to gain her support for taking office, "he will have to end all sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as with an economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - that the leader of the CIU even wanted to be allowed to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the prevailing political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masov's entry into office will be dealt with within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dollars Montserrat.
Mass has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritate Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures us that there have been no deaths as a result of the "lack of measures"
The performance of the Olot Centre does not exclude that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot Gerona Gerona Geriatric Centre provided a press conference yesterday to identify the damage to the institution of the criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least 11 seniors who were cared for.
The director of this home for senior Joan Sala arrived with a lawyer of the facility, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of the La Caritat House would be to file charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to leave the process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to a good name that this institution may suffer because it did not reveal the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to the La Caritat home now poses material compensation requirements, which are already calculated by legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already taken place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the seniors' home with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything was handled by telephone.
La Caritat rejected this extreme by means of her Director yesterday and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "in the case there are no indications that any third party would have doubts in addition to his own accused".
The man now known as "The Angel of Death" confessed 11 deaths yesterday and made it clear that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later killed the second old woman.
in this case, cause of death by taking too much insulin, unlike the first time you used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat pointed out that it is difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were likely to be used in six of the nine cases by this caregiver to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses currently taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or by serving them, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, they do not believe medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than he confessed to, and justify his conduct in the various versions that Will brought to court with the knowledge that he must change his actions when it turns out that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say they want to be available to the judiciary in order to shed light on the entire scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Yesterday investors reacted strongly to yesterday's threat to President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Marginal differentials have been closed by force and European banks' shares have dropped by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-equity market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal in the fourth place within two years.
The Bundesbank requested the closure of the sovereign debt buy-back plan for the ineffectiveness and elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within a period of time and to leave unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity rate will be forecasted "at least by March" and will hold a three-month auction with unlimited access by the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensity.
If it fails to meet the expectations created, it will re-create the market response from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity rate, God is with us!
The same was true at the May convention, where they claimed they were not even considering buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustainable.
In May, she announced that she had already bought many of them on Monday's armored fist, causing another collapse of the market.
Yesterday's one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the mood on the market that has taken place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, numbers have been published representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts amount to approximately 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potentially 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be increased.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility since the problem did not reveal stress tests in July, the amounts under the aid plan are acceptable and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get approval by parliament and still lack sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to prevail in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has eased the tone of her speech in order to release the tension in the face of the next EU summit on December 14th, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethoven's Oda for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to the ears of investors, it sounds like a four-year period since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish stock market has grown by 4.5%, twice as many as the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we are probably profiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond bid, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a great demand for it to help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They'd give us the cash we don't need - we have 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times more in March - and we'd have a high rate of access to the markets.
However, the strategy of Cesar's wife must continue to be "not only to be so, but also to seem to be so".
We can do this.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the meetings of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is silent.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will come to mind after he has considered him "totally insignificant", El Enebro's legal proceedings planned for the 16th of this month, and the required five of his seven descendants to try to force their majority and empower themselves with the help of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are setting up a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem willing to settle in his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
Five of its seven descendants, who were appointed for the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection is contained in the Trade Register, were established from its Administrative Committee.
The court proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the Trade Court official number 2 in Madrid, restored the thunder in the womb of the Alvarez family.
The appeal against the judge is until the dispute is resolved the only legal remedy guaranteeing the commission's call.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Alvarez Mezquiris is considered by David Alvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of a judicial scheme and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the 18 January negotiations, which was totally invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for substantiating the legal attack on the proceedings as "unimportant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have tried to call the court in June without success.
In El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when to address the issue of judicial assault, and the date of this review has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the rising trend of recent times, they all bet on the Ferrari Fernand Alonso triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 the legend - the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into Red Bull's hands to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a performance software that simulates marches, which the German company put on the market in 2007 for very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software has enabled Red Bull team to perform "in a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise detect during the races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 10 technicians were employed on average who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with executive information technology that analyze and propose each type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are being modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical requirement is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up about 50 km from London a race of top technology to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted - especially journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project is 580 people, including two pilots - Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull is in Formula 1 no doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettl.
However, other protagonists, whose aid is invaluable, are hiding behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has invested in its participation in racing districts.
Chief of production technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was thanks to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own shops in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with her business partner Pont Reyes.
The company will be the first of the 20 80 to 100 m2 network to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing commercial houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of Spain, Helena Herrer, cited as an example a newly renovated store in Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the shop in Barcelona is third.
Herrera didn't want to tell us where the other shops were going to open, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP personnel systems, has assured that the philosophy of opening trade will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with exclusive design of equipment stores (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of staff for business.
Helena Herrer denied that this would be a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, handling, after-sales services and even packaging".
Barcelona’s business is part of a pilot pioneer program at world level, which aims to solve potential problems with computer tools in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that may otherwise last up to two days."
"This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual services of technical assistance," Helena Herrer stressed yesterday.
Sabadell bets that he'll "stolen" in three years to his competitors a million clients
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegated member of the Banco Sabadell Board, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which, however, will try to compensate by lowering bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival without having to turn to public aid in the FROB, to obtain market shares by catching up to a million new private clients - respectively 700,000, if those who leave the bank, if necessary - since until now and the institution has been humming small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses have already been acquired by the bank.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or can be said also of sobriety, in order to reduce the costs that the bank will show when it presents the results over the period.
At this time, a number of banking institutions are determined to set their targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close his Optima programme four years ago, although he was originally three years old, but the market situation required an extension for a further period.
Customers who leave savings facilities will be their main target group.
At an APIE meeting, the Guardian insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, it believes that the path from the crisis in Spain "will be prolonged".
In addition, in two or three years 'very difficult to create employment', which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - retreats, the price of premiums for the risk that banks and savings firms pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thereby compensating for the reduction of margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a stress factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," the Guardian acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday commands to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "is now to reduce commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it assures that in Spain "they will require greater size".
"Next year he won't stay on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are "decently reduced" and does not exclude any Spanish institution from entering the red numbers.
It points out that FROB can supply funds on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding by means of a repo rate, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fusion savings
CECA Director-General refused yesterday that a further wave of savings mergers should be created and again insisted on the pace at which the sector is being reorganised.
When he started the process of combining the Spanish savings companies, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase would not take place and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that we will go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 institutions, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Heads and Executive Officials of Aragon - poz.) Olavarrieta noted that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it turns out, in the instalments that are in their time, not now, have appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"To go from 45 associates with an average assets volume of 28,000 million to 17 and 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them bigger and thus fall in line with the Treaty of Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not too happy views on slowness of the process" which show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is a reminder that we must be in the deadline before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured Spain yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who doubt it have "lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" in terms of financial institutions and savings and the system which managed the "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has set conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets has caused a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reduction for small and medium-sized enterprises, through regulation of private brokering agencies or cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed people without taxes, to the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - pcs.), the administrator of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined critics at the address of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
In advance, Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be like, which points to the idea of respecting the old traditions that most of the other members adhere to.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany itself, but also Austria or the Netherlands for example, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the return to March - although it may now appear to be scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to recast the euro with greater macro-economic supervision, budgetary consistency, fines for guilty countries, possible delays in payments for some of them, and to extend the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for spins.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission triggered deficits in 2009, the German Government withdrew from the sleeve the constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (the fiscal strictness plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
Second, the Central European country showed when Merkel painfully extended the decision on Greece's rescue.
It has already been the subject of strong criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last October, Merkel re-emerged with a clear opinion when it demanded that the European Union conventions be reformed to allow the rescue of a Member State while at the same time allowing private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has identified a red line it does not intend to cross.
And he tells all of us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that he seems to disagree too much with, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone in which States violating the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth by increasing savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that ruled in the years of Spain's growth boom, simply does not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will change the peace of mind.
And take advantage of the opportunities they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, through critics at Merkel's address, the way of thinking that things need to be put in order.
However, the red line that Germany has outlined is there, and it does not appear that it would want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the euro area cannot be excluded from all too many serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and Circumstances
The tricks that Alonso and Ramos performed in the fight with Ajax show the wit not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the League of Champions against Ajax on November 23rd caused the ink sea to be written down as to whether or not this is an unsportsympathetic act and whether UEFA should possibly punish both football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) appointed players were deliberately wasting time on each other at a time when a foul was to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in their lead group - and will be able, card-free, to continue until the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission awarded Coach José Mourinh a two-game sentence and the guilty players received a fine.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, which is rules that are unwritten but are monitored.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team was a participant (who boasts in his anthem of nobility and honour, and who has already fined his players for similar acts), and it seems also thanks to the dramatic leadership of Mourinhe, who thus adds to his long history of comedian and provocateur another episode.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of negotiation, which is not explicitly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is an circumvention of the law in such cases; it is indeed an action that respects the rules of sport, whose meaning, however, appears to be trying to circumvent.
The type of damage such conduct causes to a sports spirit is resolved.
One of the characteristics of sports behaviour is the physical integrity of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, or the violent game has not occurred.
Another of these features characterized by a clean game is to avoid allowing players to take advantage of the team of opponents because of their wrongdoing - which has also not happened here.
So paradoxical to the action of the players of Real Madrid is the fact that what we normally characterize as a fraud or circumvention of the law did not occur, but that this behaviour should have been as visible as possible in order to obtain the punishment.
They waited, and they were happy to be punished.
The next question, however, is how the perpetrators of their deliberate wrongdoing will benefit.
It is necessary to point out here that the opponent does not get into an disadvantaged position and that in the current match he will not achieve any benefit, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next match, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and besides this the players will be punished, and will move on to the second round of cards, where one card less than in the first round is sufficient to be excluded.
So as the wheels go on, it won't be clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which is part of a strategic decision that will allow maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case of which we are dealing, the players were not intended to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of breach of rules), but rather to choose when to obey it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between wit and circumvention of the rules is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a question of wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and the way in which instructions were passed on to provoke them from the leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Calendar Dictate concentrates this year's avalanche on December 16th and 17th.
The celebration of the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, is fast approaching.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, there are again pre-Christmas parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but because of the crisis they have fought to get customers by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) the application for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for days in peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no operation.
As has been the case since 2008, when the years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning tradition, many employees pay for the loss of their own pockets at parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the border, says the president of the Gremi de Restauracíó de Barcelona Restaurant Association, Gaieta Farras.
A representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities does not at this time dare to predict what celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as the price theme is concerned, they are careful," he adds.
Businesses will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that due to the crisis customers tend to go down by a degree and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The survey in the various facilities shows that the greatest effort to request a reservation is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group announces a real boom on this Friday, with the most requirements for losses up to EUR 30, which have been adjusted by the menus offered, the total prices of which range from EUR 25 to EUR 30.
in another important company, which is Andilana, which reads 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought a specialty of this year's calendar of more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the group AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after having recorded an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that December 18th will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations will take place among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, since compared to last year, guests tended to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - poz.).
They also noted that companies are already showing up who are again inviting their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vice-President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Centres of Free Time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that the end of the tunnel begins to be seen and claims that the number of reservations has "reanimated", although clients "agree to the maximum".
This impression, even during Christmas celebrations, did not give way to paying attention.
Pakistan's nuclear program breeds major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a "faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that is fuelled by Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details offered by representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety rather than to increase, is "on retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but they are stored in pieces to ease their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
An increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and a controlled missile programme are no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and presenting a reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; in view of the decline in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes controlled by bullets," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at meetings with their counterparts from the United States.
The biggest news release published by Julian Assange's server is the growing decline in cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increasing pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
A memo issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or rejected".
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's chief of army that "the Pakistani army must end its silent support for terrorist groups".
Hunt for Chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking officer responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol is issuing a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze, where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday an "extraordinary challenge", a so-called red note, to "localization and monitoring of movement" of Assange.
But it's not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse facing Australia in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer, Wikileaks Mark Stephens, assures that "police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20, when the International Police Department, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines for the identification or localisation of Assange "in order to impose a temporary link and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, however, consider the so-called red note as allowing the arrest to take place - this must be provided by the national police force - especially where the States have a bilateral agreement on the issue of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
This step was made worse by Asseng's lawyers, who published writing yesterday, claiming that ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via videoconference.
They also recall that Asseng requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Berija, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother is defending her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he provided Skype with an interview with Time magazine editor-in-chief from an unknown place - in this interview he requested the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's demission.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy at the United Nations and violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the request of the demission as "funny and absurd".
"I am not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual operating the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking worker responsible for combating terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assang to the importance of this is contrasting with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have voiced these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibility of involving Wikileaks among terrorist organisations "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them".
Tom Flanagan, the advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further and said that Assange should be "killed", which he then had to call off.
"Obama should write a reward on him or use a drone or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a potential candidate for president.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking information has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," Fox reported at the station
Puigcercós is looking for the ERC peace by "swimming" on the followers of the Carod
The Republican leader shall allow the party to vote in secret on its stay.
Hugot proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercos has apparently found a recipe to fight the already several internal revolutions in the ERC series (the Left Republic Party of Catalonia - poz. cz.), with no results due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture of demission seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluíse Carod-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as its leader himself, and that he is absolutely unable to cause him the kind of concern he has with other missing currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will seek new criticism by winking to help him turn to the general elections.
At first, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to express themselves in secret for his tenure.
By voting cards, not by raising your hand.
If the supporters of Carod wish to give the President a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid a split and submission of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered as confirmed with half the votes and one additional, but added without specifying the percentage that he would not have been a good result "in Bulgaria".
Carod's supporters ask the President more than to make his position available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercos controls the largest organ at the congresses.
But given that they do not have the majority enough to force demissions, they will try to enforce a plan from now on to May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic orientation document to be voted on by the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercose in exchange for this promise to move Congress already in autumn 2011.
The ERC leader declared that "many loudness" would damage stability, and that its aim was to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a notable article that current counselor Joseph Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercos's ideology, this innovation consultant took the matter into consideration that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named those five, two of whom are excellent.
The first is the "overassembly" of the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also involving new faces that are from the Carod-friendly sector.
The second target could be a big news.
HUGUET suggests that the ERC should complete its meeting as a mechanism of operation.
It is therefore fighting for reform of the constitutions so that congresses can be held through the delegations elected by the vote.
The termination of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 shrivelling assembly decided that the meeting should be assessed at a special congress on reform of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without sneezing critical sectors, it might be a good time to deal with this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 killed in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO daily.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the finding of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, then a blow from grace to the head and had hands and legs tied with rope.
The next day a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Soon on Thursday, 4 November, comrades discovered a body carrying signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the likely criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50 - year - old man was killed in Nezahualcoyotl after leaving his house and wanting to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, they were shot in the head by two victims at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in Ecatepec County.
The body of a man shot in the forehead was found in Chalco on a remote road in El Naranjo colony, and a .25 weapon shell was found beneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The rescue files carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, however, they were not found.
The Tepototán residents reported finding bodies with their hands tied back and head wrapped in the place of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported killed who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda, at the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, and reports threatening to die were also found in the victims.
A day later, she was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box containing a human head.
In a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, packed in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregiable.
On the 17th, two dead women were found packed in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found killed by a man wrapped in a yellow blue sheet, who was previously identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report that the killers left at his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman without signs of life with two wounds to the back of her head was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla.
A tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally, "Sacred Death" - acknowledgment) was discovered on the woman's skin, as well as necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group were found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape and a message was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organisations in which it said, "This is going to happen to those who won't."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying signs of torture and tied limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Center of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was sewn and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancon and was packed in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the second one was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, agents and a news card found him.
China adheres to its objective of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country at the UN conference on climate change COP16 assured him that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, and pointed out that it was committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China has kept its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, a representative of the country, assured at the UN conference on climate change.
In his first public address to the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made a tremendous effort to reduce carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, it is clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been noted, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities in order to achieve their objectives in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, as he said, various multi-year plans, funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries, have been under way or have been completed.
For example, this is the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been introduced over the last five years, which has received investments from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also under way, and the project on the exchange of light bulbs for saving light bulbs and the project on mitigation and adaptation has been clarified.
Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor for climate change, assured the same table that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions per capita represents 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts with regard to energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Legal exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - poz. poz.) said that the former Chairman of this party is entitled to claim his right with the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientes was lawful and that the former President of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and to claim his right.
in an interview which was received before the objection was raised by the Governor of the State of Gabon, Cué Monteagud, said that the exclusion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, in his case, a complaint to the National Council Order Commission in order to be a decision taken by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is now no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the Alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, is strengthened.
"Toto (the 2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he noted.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and that is why "there is no fear of internal competitiveness, on the contrary we are profiting from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said that the committee can elect without debate the best president or chairman it deserves for the next three years, so it will hand over the relay to "whom the committee determines".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five proudly hand over the office of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise the party recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future clans, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to escort Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, would represent a flag and will be subject to observations throughout the country, as "many expectations and lawsuits have been placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be worthy of these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI side (Partido Revolutionaryario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, p.m.)) due to his speeches within the four-year reigning period, César Nava invited the PRI members to think about the six-year periods of the former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If in PRI they believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them to come out of their shells," he testified.
He stated that the head of federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during his speech in the National Auditorium, since no grate or censorship is used in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act law is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," the American president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today contributed to the national mobilization of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an Internet link to a more extensive document, which asks the public to immediately join the senators as the vote on this law approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of the tax reduction from the Bush era and the financing of the government was approved.
Such blocking, which was notified by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and on other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons called START.
When asked about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the Presidential Speaker said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we must settle the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "conclusion vote" on the Dream Act law, so that the proposal for the legalisation of students without documents could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely to be next week.
The Senatorial approval of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who had reached the United States 16 years earlier, stayed in the country for the last five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or an army.
However, the supporters need the assistance of several republicans to approve draft 60 votes, so the organisation of its supporters is carrying out intensive agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats whose majority of the Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to obtain several republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the opposition is most aligned are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have announced that they will no longer support it next time.
Another republic that supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed itself.
Although the House of Representatives is attached to another version, according to most analysts Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature put your finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la lalaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is a similar Czech "hit a nail on the head - poz. poz. poz.)
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of language was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"This is what I understand with Sex in my language, but... finger in the morning? What is waiting for me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure with a language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at the second fair they devoted themselves to the topic of Sex in Spanish, she explained).
The finger in the morning "brings us to the narrow ones", said the Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table, the modern Marisol Schultz and the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramirez, Maya Monter and Louise Garcia Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text devoted to Gonzal Celori, which Schultz then referred to as a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist, who, when searching for knowledge, walks from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not receive an answer even though the clue of the same story does.
The infectologist goes away convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after being frustrated with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: "the wound is truly open and the symbolic scar is."
The protagonist sighed slowly and concluded that "the wound was only enough to find out that it was really open and that it did not exist", but that it was convinced that pleasure and backing in the language must go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played with both of us.
Nicaragujec Sergio Ramírez also performed a delightful story, which he called The Glory of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
from the elements of magical reality tells of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who went far, or corrected the honor that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it were not missing, and here is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the story of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), mocked us with a fictitious testimony, which was presented in stories as real, but otherwise failed to tell the story of America with such an imagery that it even lacked study."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have bigger fantasies" and exactly where the reality and the lie come together, where the story no longer knows what belongs to one group and, to another, the fictional literature of its peak.
It really calls it a "cervant tradition".
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monter stressed and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its word Finger made possible in the morning.
The Cuban-Portorist writer pointed to the great impact of social violence on her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of a compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their 'chemical response'.
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also stressed "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and mind control, which distorts dogmatics, he forgets that "there is little behind every touch, and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and realities we must color: and to color means to place a finger in the wound many times and to bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and to harass also the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve on three occasions a decisive series.
In the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the finals, two different styles are also collided with their techniques, teams that have a distinct difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve on three occasions a decisive series, but until now he had left with the unattained, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stay one step ahead of the winner, and curiously played the next final with the same team.
The Santist strategist made it to his first final at the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had the burden of the Morelia club, with which he passed a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenars" (the other nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - late.) after 210 minutes of the game inadvertently 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turn on 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, even though he says that the most important institution is for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm committed to, and the title would also be for me, of course, but the first is the most important," said the coach when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in the living memory has the previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we took the lesson that until the referee writes the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action as well as the players, because last time with two penalettes, we were ready to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the match is over, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared, in the last tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when he was a title in our hands, but we have lost him, it has left us something and we hope that nothing will happen this time."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other one and taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
United States changes visa rules
People will have to turn to the Centres of the Service for visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shorter.
As from 10 January 2011, the process of processing visas at the Embassy of the United States and consulates will be amended.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres of the Service for Visa Applicants (ASC) before interviewing the Consular Department.
Staff from the ASC will receive biometric information from the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, among which are the following:
The total cost of issuing a visa will be lower, no fee will be necessary for the appointment, the second for processing the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: $140 per tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary staff visa) and $390 per visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview at the Consular Department will spend less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for visas at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee for the service of $26.

NASA to announce the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could lead to a break in the search for alien life.
The United States National Aviation and Space Office (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1:00 by an expert on astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and the future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the press, NASA assured her that she would present "a discovery that would cause a breakdown in the search for alien life", which sparked speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in unholy conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could imagine that one day they will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature uses arsenic in some way for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is a different, second form of life, different from what we know".
The Space Agency will announce the real extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by the geologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", declare.
The 60th parliamentary period, when an opposition bloc was established in Congress, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democraticatica, Czech "Page of Democratic Revolution" - later translated), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Page of Work" - later translated), Convergence (Czech "Consistence" later translated) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the coming of "bipartism" to Parliament.
Before the beginning of the session at the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynso Esparza by PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo by PRD and Patron Montalvo "stammered" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, since it pronounced them.
This reform, they repeated, starts "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, co-ordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Britt (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - cf. cf.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality from the Pursuit of the PRI (Partido Revolutionaryario Institutional, Czech "The Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He pointed out that during the following days they would speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subject to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even want to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergence, said that they were compatible with the PD, PT and Patron, so they would form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued to make Congress, after being monopolistic, now "double".
The aspiration of the reform of the law is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, according to Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by PT explained that Congress has now become a "privilegation" of two - in a reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"In the old days, only one side controlled it, today it's divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected so that he could be given a seat at the table.
"In order for the five Members, who are likely to be nine, but who see us now at five, not to remain because of the agreements they have made outside, each in another faction, we have united ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed to, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The city council in Mazatlan will pay another check to the company's owner supplying the electricity.
Another check for a little over 200,000 pesos was sent by the councilman to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
This sum paid in this second half by the owner of the company supplying the material will rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the city hall's transparency page, this last check number 92584 was sent on 16 November of this year, was put on display 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was referred to as "the settlement of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, who was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for high-priced sales, a further fee.
What has not been said is the total amount that the councilwoman still owes her and how many checks will be sent in favour of Camacha Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought now, only it pays what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks appeared "again" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 days 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme Audit Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer has ascertained that it has not used the services of the councilor's supplier again.
In the previous period, after July 25th, Noroeste published an audit of the cheques issued by the councillors to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachá Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also conducted transactions with Jumapam, where it included checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites urgently need maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist over the poor condition of Sánchez Taboada's speech in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist, the authorities in Mazatlan ask the tourist sector to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad shape and do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Zone Dorado region, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of destination, and the bad news that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see the disorder, which adversely affects close businesses.
"Politics don't know what it's like to shut down a business for one day, and they have no idea of the bids they're avoiding, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from repeating itself, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing shortcomings," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, since not only because we are a tourist area, we should make maintenance, because even as residents we deserve a clean home, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy."
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer - cf. cf.).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not only the promotion that we need to offer a good product, i.e. a city that flows through the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where the maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out continuously," he said.
"There was no need to pay attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to be put in order in cooperation with the council, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will be necessary to first put these places in order to be attractive and so that we can list them on the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests Congress results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is convulsing in spasms and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 PANs, three by Partido Nueva Alliance, two by PD, one by PT, one by Convergence and the last by PVEM, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from the new members of Congress, it is to be able to implement good leadership, commitments towards society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patronage will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the road to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival guides for rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlaps that would move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be particularly committed to companies and sectors, because they were the residents of Sinaloa, who gave them their vote in the previous elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to take all the strength to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth in order to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
In terms of tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and support the tourism ministry.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate, given that it is an important economic activity that brings currency and investment, which is also directly opposed to agriculture."
In addition to providing funds for the start-up tourism projects, Congress should help to provide the state with security and help with the alcohol law, which has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
The dolls, cars and bicycles are with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the family of the Coronad Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their ideas about the upcoming festival of the Three Kings, since their home is home to exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up the hope that Kashpar, Melichar, and Balthazar will give them toys and clothing they so long for.
The family lives in a humble home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a permanent job.
"So sometimes it's hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell Mandarins and potatoes... I go out with "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wishes for a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús, he would have wanted Cayetana's sized clothes for one year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I said to him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive', he remembers Cayetana's sorrow.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is 12 years old, 10 years old, while 8 years old Miguel is 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is short on sneakers, so he could use a five-and-a-half-and-six pair.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Searching for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the journal Noroeste bring a gift or cash in cash.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
The ten tours were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 branches of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the police in Quebek.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, both suspected bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to arrive at the Sherbrook Judicial Palace after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, holding it to trade it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections took place after a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to join these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional investigation department of the city of Estrie State Police of Quebek, the State Police in Sherbrook and the police department of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be easy to continue.
The proposal for a law of conservatives, which according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I'm relying on Chart to a great extent."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built the snag under your feet," said liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would allow any person from a ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The chief of the Quebek Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards a bad goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her side not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree that we should take measures against the transferees of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be a portent of another draft law, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the proposal of the law of conservatives because it imposes guilt on refugees and places children in prison for at least one year," Mrs Chow explained.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenny accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians publicly tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to gun it down and treat it like a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenny responded.
The government has not declared its confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that any member against it would respond to his position in front of his constituents.
A new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement, the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and colluding unit, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation committee on the issue.
Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying not to forget this idea: Québec intends to consult the New York Department of Investigation in January next year.
Metropolis has been available as a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That is why Tuesday’s announcement surprised some of us.
It should be noted that, at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebek on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was no longer necessary for public safety critic PQ Stéphane Bergeron to evaluate this notice as "a queen pulled out of a hat" and "amateur knee solution".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in public.
"In addition, Mr Charest asserts that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as do you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means of achieving the creation of an investigation committee is the demission of Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute of Higher Education of Public Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed to Quebek to give special authority to the Inspector General to investigate the collapse and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's government files.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, amend the Penal Code so that it would be better suited for this type of crime.
This requirement would have been based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security Vic Toews has confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck a group of bikers, although the Penal Code had not yet been amended, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the gangster law.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several water flows have been under strict control due to severe precipitation that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were pre-emptively evacuated.
There was another land collapse in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's out of the way.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy precipitation, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 further millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the valley of Outauais were hit the most.
It could drop up to 100 millimeters.
If we count these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some watercourses.
Quebek's rescue service announced on Wednesday evening a warning against the danger of floods for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the la Laurentides forest, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become subject to flood preparedness and continuous checks.
In the de Lanaudière area, severe precipitation caused by the discharge of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marceline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte the result of heavy rains was cut down by a commission bridge.
Two residences had to be pre-emptively evacuated.
In Outauais the spilling of some lakes off the shore caused some closures, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Rescue services have an emergency and are overseeing the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a warning Wednesday from strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially embarrassed
The Quebec Broadcasting Moderator, Stéphane Dupont, suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Standards Council (RTTV) over controversial statements concerning social assistance and Haitians, as well as for gross broadcasts.
The Broadcasting and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and the inappropriate negative exclusion of Haitians from gross expression, which does not correspond to the broadcast broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting and Television Board received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after the complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of Quebek’s social assistance.
The group complained that the amounts indicated on the broadcast were incorrect.
Moderators must present reliable information, not misleading.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stephene Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most Commission members concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the contentious episodes of "Dupont's noon reports" have come across a sensitive topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no uproar against him.
The last dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stephene Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort went to a media shootout that triggered a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator announced that he did not send any gift to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the necessary money will actually be received.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already recanted my orderly postponement of the matter."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator declared.
In all decisions, the Commission rejects the use of gross expression in broadcasting.
Either way, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "over the limits of its duties".
For a station which will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, there are minimal consequences.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmmal, has an extremely special experience.
Atlet, which excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickbox and Thai boxing enters the tattoos and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained to Earthmal, who has lived silently in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games around the world, because for those who don't like playing on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently this man, who works as a security guard and as a supporter for UPS, has just added bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23rd to October 30th, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the category kickbox full contact and the Thai box," he said.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the World Cup in San Shou."
"The contestants who ended up the first four in the last world championship in every category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I ended up in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third, I added."
"The interesting thing is, in every competition, I've made some progress."
"At this rate, I'll be the first one this year or the next!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot blows are allowed, as well as throwing on the ground.
The games are traditionally held on the platform and rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer of this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal is supposed to maintain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda Super Bowl" Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the cute guy."
"It's kind of like the equivalent for Stade Lumpinee."
"It was a great experience."
ZemmaI won his first game, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the final.
"He who defeated me was a true pro, analyzed."
"They are four competing categories (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category shall be met so that the only champion, king of kung fu, may be crowned."
450 contracted millions without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed on a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most significant contract, a contract for the management of the entire project totalling $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie garence, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie Guerrence" received a lucrative contract without any announcement of public competition.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies presents us with a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and causing price increases.
"It's a new way to realize the collapse and eliminate competition."
"This means that people who are no longer doing side agreements secretly, they are already doing them openly today," PQ Member Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said it was hard to bear how public interest could be sold like that.
Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, refused this afternoon, strongly denying that this contract would be a collide.
"I have my own way," she summed up and claimed that PQ was "dishonest" and "was lacking accuracy".
She said "it would be the least" for PQ to apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more undertakings to group their mutual experts to respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very difficult given the volume of work.
Construction is already under way and must be scheduled by 2012.
However, the contract was recognised without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebek, not even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of the consortium in the field of consulting in engineering is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly in the speed of the business register of Quebek companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the consortium of the Énergie Guerrence, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the land of La Baie James is a typical of the special dynamics of the labour force and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that would make us drop our forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded after a mutual agreement.
"If you're going to a public competition and if there's not enough contestants to bid, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you pick up the people who are in the contract as contestants, and you say, "Let's make a deal with satisfaction and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not the price but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie garence consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebek Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following Le Devoire’s verification, he calculated 109 consultancy contracts in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, of which Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the "Energy of Guerance".
All contracts were closed.
Together, they read $449,783 344, including a contract with the company Énergie garance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebek".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before she made it clear that it was rather her management staff.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not arouse confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumer trusts very little in sustainable development actors, but also in "unbiased" brands and environmental certificates, so that it is guided by the choice of products.
The worst part is that even if we bathe in a media universe that insists on us and urges us to consume socially more responsiblely, this media universe complains of a lack of reliable information, failure to fulfil obligations that even qualify as a barrier to its commitment, Baromètre cites the responsible consumption, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebek, who are trying to sell them, do not trust them too much
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't trust the environmental promises of companies simply because green advertising companies is looking at a measuring tool that has developed the Observatory of Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the authenticity of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the authenticity of products and brands identified as ecologically responsible, are listed by Barometers.
In the same way, the policy debate on this topic is accepted as a serious only 14.6% of the people of Quebek.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be a priority for stimulating this page of consumption currently revived by almost a third of Quebek consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and a questionable nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified at a higher price for these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekus are untrustworthy about the data they provide on products or "green" services that we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products to respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% preferred shopping for merchants from their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumer Québek likes to present himself as the king of recycling, which strives for as little environmental impact as possible by caring for animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of the people in Quebek said they were using public transportation or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive survey of behavior that used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of eXcentris cinema complex
The government of Quebek, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent's Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebek proposes a loan, the latter being lower, some initial expectation that could lay the groundwork for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million demand were already rejected by Quebek last spring, but applications have already been revised for reduction.
The proposal and the plan of action were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must be really rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema and Cinematographic Centres in Quebek opposed the State's direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project unless he did so for other cinemas.
On the other hand, several participants in the debate called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinema during ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for the change by the State Financial Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is loud in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will spend $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th of next year and to feature Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, and so he ignores himself, he and his group are thinking about the proposals for the reductions that have been made to him.
Lifted curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but they also express their sense of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that each Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
four new reports, among which were the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday exposed to public exposure, also provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details at which point the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides a few explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian Minority Complex, almost stuck, may call for political leaders to talk about internal stakes instead of realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in a campaign on free trade in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: everywhere but potentially too dangerous to be talked about".
The Ambassador understands this "affirming silence" less that both countries maintain strong political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better to manage these important relations should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure that the government remains in the vote of confidence at the beginning of February regarding the federal budget, which Canada will publicly recognise in more than ten years for its first deficit, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of Parliament in order to prevent it from being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties call into question their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to an increasingly negative picture that casts dramatic shows on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the dispatch of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very witty links to Maher Arar, No-Fly-List or abductions for the purpose of violent interrogations with the CIA are observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but based on the principle of case-by-case.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, a state secret."
"Mystery has accepted that the file is being revised."
Let's finally note that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, reported on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
Mike Huckabee in the United States reported it and heard it.
World Light Restoration Plan
Yesterday in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the further restrictions to be achieved to stabilise the planet's climate from now on to 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push into Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-realizable commitments to reduce on the part of industrially advanced countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the light bulbs, which monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent lamps or, even better, electric-luminescence diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet caused by lighting would be discarded.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of emissions from a car park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow for the reduction of global emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to achieve climate stabilisation at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In hot bulbs 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorescent lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Flu compact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, such as Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible savings with a plan of compensation that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about flu compact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up a collection.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluorescent bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant, which releases many of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in heated bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres supply 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the gains that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, the UN speaker stressed."
"He requests all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the notification of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the latest date - the middle midnight - to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's defiance.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on TV that the commission is "continuing work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were numerous calls worldwide for CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "deceptive" voting in the north, managed by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) since the failed state coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the FN (New Army) electoral intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country have encouraged supporters of the Côte d'Ivoire Coast to go to vote.
The elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took account of the complaints Gbagbo filed.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo consider that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is ruled by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in notification of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he suffered a loss and that a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from transmitting the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Côte d'Ivoire political faction that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, October 31st, as a winner with 38% of votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henry Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the words of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by the provisional data on seasonal deviation correction (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has risen to 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to be 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In the broader picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current young people in the labour market was still emerging with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
As for seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), that is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6%, including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population recorded the benefits of unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a statistical agency of the European Union, is also continuing to develop monthly statistics and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) on Tuesday in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini is charged and detained.
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste management companies and the brother of the PS Board of Management Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly subdued.
Alexandre Guerini has been accused of misusing the company's assets, misappropriation of public funds and public property, secrecy, payment of bribes, acceptance of bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and holding ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and insists that the judge explain himself to himself all the questions he intends to ask him, not some delusion."
"It is easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but the other thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florenceault, declared to the AFP before questioning her client.
Mr. Guerini stated through his lawyers that he had sent a judge before his brief hearing to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensure the operation of the puzzles he was supposed to manage.
Regarding the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Auglamation Augragna, was charged on Wednesday with misusing public funds and sets, and left at large, under judicial supervision, the prohibition of meeting, protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts to him."
"The investigating judge looks into it and leaves it free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnux.
Another four persons were charged and released on the night of Tuesday on Wednesday, with being under judicial supervision for two of them, state prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are accused of one for "the theft and abuse of the company's property", the other for "the complet in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, business associate Alexander Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "secreting the abuse of the company's property".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have helped to launder money from a large-scale gangsterry.
The investigation is conducted in several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the city community of Marseille (MPM).
The Clotilde Reiss case: The Elysian Palace has exaggerated Syria's mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spying", united opinions in France, put diplomacy into combat readiness and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakaland, an Iranian prisoner in France and sought by an American court for the southern trade in material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they are subjected to the sharp light of the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:French comments on how to resolve hostages".
Elyseus Strategic Affairs Adviser, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay Director for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the representative of the American Allegrone Diplomacy.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do just as much for being transported back to their own nationals by the violence held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "keep saying "in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man", "innocentness", "immediate liberation".
Iran's regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be put into trouble.
"Do the more they ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "it will solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
He announces that the liberation of Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French Embassy gives her refuge) "will require payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (the bail of EUR 230 000).
And they will announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will "strengthen".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest more or less 1,800 French people living in Iran", he says.
August 28th, 2009
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakaland, of whom the United States declares that he has been expelled for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as many observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to obtain material for the nuclear program, the deployment of Majid Khakavanda is a bad news.
France has entered into a contract?
Freeing an Iranian for the release of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, it states, was not only "surpassed by this judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to oppose it.
"There were discussions between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakaand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The adviser to the Elysian Palace dials the phone number, hangs up the phone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of Clotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysée Palace is developing efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized "outbreaks" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influenced" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that manipulation bears its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 is evoking the media "brightness" of French officials.
On which is the degree of "thank you", expressed to M. Assad, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their declaration of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication "goes towards the validation of President Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria" is being analysed.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical votes in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserving".
By "overplaying the Syrian role", Paris tries to "demonstrate Syria, what praisers can do when playing a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to "sow grains of dissension between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, no matter what it is"
"But we still thanked them."
"It should at least cause confusion and confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysée Palace.
The communication thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivalski", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online after midnight by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials have indicated.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years of age, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, head of the Ministry that is in charge of the bill.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it to do so by a responsible worker.
It will also make available to people who ask for it, free programs that allow you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most affected countries and the daily press brings with it various facts about the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an undeniable champion in world online game competitions.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
The World Championship in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of concern over suspicion of corruption, Fif's executive committee set up on Thursday in the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where fighting for influence and lobbying risk that technical criteria will be overtaken.
The thing is for sure, the Royal Fif competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will be able to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to take up the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political stakes around the world.
Negotiation in the backstage faces the risk that it will last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fif's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) documents contain the best arguments as well as their competitors' documentation.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive commission in an hour to vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam) may have ruined the chances of its country, the dignitary, which has hosted the world championship only once in a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it broadcasts a document that "stills the pin" of three influential CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fif unhappy and put English leaders in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that his predecessors performed in the role of Tony Blair, who managed to win the Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spanish-Portugal couple do not miss the triumphs of the already prepared stadiums, its welcome (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any remedies against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stads, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly announced "some competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal conjectures that were barely charged with the English press against CE members (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," said Mr Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favourite with its considerable experience in 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the headquarters of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a great head start ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidates seem to be premature for both countries that together in 2002 passed the "test".
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fif wishes fervently, has made the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled out of the sleeve of a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the flat charges of TV (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, creating a driving force for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Palace of Elysée calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But clearly it is not in good harmony with the share of the secret associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persisted all the time.
In one way or another.
In 2006, without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that "it will sometimes be decided in the autumn of 2011".
As members of the UMP Parliament recalled on Wednesday evening at the Palace of Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" had a little hot weather.
Was it an official notice of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a remark, not a notification.
It's not the first time he's reminded of such meetings as the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he passed away in July 2009.
Rebelies in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Speeding up the path to the PS bid, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal's cradle, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, its 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for combat teams rather early than planned.
Bad research on the other side.
Firstly, voters of the right would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP," the people from the immediate and cautiously surrounding the Prime Minister responded.
"If he believes a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, balanced by the obvious.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for withdrawal from the crisis or, at least, the notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis commits, the Securities Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today in European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the Central European Bank in addressing the European state's debt crisis.
She didn't want to say that she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I give my consideration to my European partners ..."
Earlier this evening, in Brussels, in his interview with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Commission, President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more explicit in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied that the programme for the purchase of state titles on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
The only certainty: The Central European Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds from the Central European Bank's treasury have doubled to nearly EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And because of the market misunderstandings, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the euro system's central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no doubts among market operators regarding the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant exchange rate change.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank’s arsenal, this last designated bank shall apply to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous conditions and for a duration of from one week to three months.
Today, economists expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of purchase of its bonds in order to revive the dwindling market", Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace the lack of investors on the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the burning of paid performances by the countries among the most fragile", the important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be more worried about reducing their debt rather than stabilising it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has its back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, an alarming situation eased a little, yesterday with a return rate of 10 years.
A return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the region's presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "unsolvable" and that he was expecting an "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then commented on.
In each case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk contracts (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some disturbance in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points in Spain.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, claimed to be "too busy" with the "rapid development of markets" and possible disease originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stellzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and innumerably, its problem is the absence of growth and inexpressible fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is currently expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates the deficit of public finances to be an additional 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% of the projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From here on, a novelty of 7 billion euros in additions to the draft state budget that could be introduced after the holidays.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the International Monetary Fund Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the effort required by other countries," notes Pierre Carlo Padoan, the lead economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be facing a motion to express distrust of the House of Deputies and, subsequently, the elections to be held at the end of March could be organised.
This would lead to a period of limited time to take a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed this again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays all day and night, they are obviously very committed to defending their currency and currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest on European government bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation office announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target that is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May a realistic policy is not sufficiently transparent and obvious, especially based on banking systems," says economic Exane BNP Paribas.
What's more, "political time runs slower than market time."
The knowledge of this interrupted connection and the dangers that it is hiding is intensifying European countries' discussions aimed at strengthening already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their counterparts from the G20, are developing very well.
In view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is today.
It is the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As regards the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, denied a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this journey is not to increase the funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for achieving this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are a different route from Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid seeking international assistance even before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their confidence.
The European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the standardisation process of sovereign bonds markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-take stock of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is an entirely first-time trading plan for European sovereign claims, believe that an allowance of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The envelope exists: it is the European financial stability mechanism, which is subsidised to this day by EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have since now orange emergency due to the risk of snow and irritants.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loire, Les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, have joined the 20 districts that already have declared orange emergency, 18 already since midday and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Méteo France, there are significant snow surges that cause problems in the north of La Gironde and the forest Charentes and slightly snow on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the areas concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Du Poita and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow rushes are big enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activity, Méteo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and the police recommend leaving with their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks was cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No specific measures are envisaged on Wednesday evening to limit freight transport.
The District Office "calls all car drivers to the greatest care on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the ticket".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy on Thursday and 10% to Orly on account of the expected snow surges.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We are reminded of the 23 billion per metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
To enable this building to be launched, the State announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, it is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual-source funding for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first supplements.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains mechanisms to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and raising taxes from offices in Ile-de-France.
First, the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The yield from this interest is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the offices that already exist, "in order to be modernised in order to increase the revenue obtained from it and to affect the increase by Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Overwhelming.
It's not numbered in the text.
We've got up to 4 billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources join 4 billion euros from the capital grant that will be mobilised by the State and invested in Sociité du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us in SGP.
"Since we've created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then scrape up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will not be allocated to the 2014 budget until 2013.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promises belong to still absent subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat disturbing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and responsible scouts
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and it precedes the future of a controlled regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists solely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about Berlusconi's sex life is announcing what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and the slightly cartoon profile of Kadafie has long been a theme for cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that classified documents may be made up of just news from already known people is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats what has already been written in previous works (the Graal, the Rennes-le-Château mystery, the Templars or the Zednars).
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (and does not know where to look for news about non-existent ones), but because those who are committed to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, editor in the newspaper Libération), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The information with high secrecy about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department, was the same information that Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents cause so much violence?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and even though the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the Heads of State can call or fly on a plane to a joint dinner, has lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it appears to be ignored.
However, the fact that it repeats itself publicly, shames the duty of hypocrisy and sheds the bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a severe blow, not a negligent one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "executors".
But let's get from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to perceive all power as some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been demonstrated since the possibility of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, became a citizen of the ultimate victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even "mortures" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's vigilante - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he keep a power that no longer has the ability to keep his own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is unconscionable (and the unconscionable secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is truly a mysterious mystery because it is drawn out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was unconscionable secrets means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks didn't make a mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something great to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of saved power so significant?
It is clear that in the future the states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equal to its publication on a poster posted on the corner of the street.
But it is also clear that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep a secret message on the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can they be kept in secret in the future in private and sensitive news ?
I know it's a science fiction for the moment, and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are transporting discreetly to perform formalities on uncontrollable routes and only carry messages that can remember or rather hide rare information in the soles of their shoes.
The information will be stored in unique copies in keyholes: overall, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means backwards.
A century later, when wireless telegraph meant revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed movie lovers to film one step at a time, move it forward and back, and reveal all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (numericals) only allow them to jump over chapters, that is, in macropores.
Through the trains we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane and transport that includes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication techniques will return to the carts of drawn horses.
Last remark.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been established in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now it's an embassy that requires confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep promises for quickly unblocked financing (fast start or early start funding) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (that is 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew up a large essay to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to finance a fast start: a report clarifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: advanced countries and civil society would want all developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading it on the right path to meeting its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realized without prejudice to public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no match for what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding has been retained and it adds 150 million to it for three years the title of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or deadlines at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publice au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), to meet its commitment to finance "new and additional" ...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating it.
Some people, like France, think that 1€ of the loan is equal to 1€ of the donation.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proved for certain investments that are profitable (often related to projects linked to the reduction of emissions consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as the title of our liabilities but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only provide the following justification: it "obsesses" its commitment of EUR 420 million, of which it makes 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (EUR 36.1 million) - see EU document to verify it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes use of the loan to that extent.
Germany has requested 46% of these, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% of the gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to meet its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
That's a beautiful kale piece!
For the sake of summary, in its funding "fast start" France operates with a double shedding: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends 36.1m euros, it can convince that it is issuing 420m euros "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bertie who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate if only to borrow?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate debates.
But it could be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and fairness and justice to the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent the debate on deposits to long-term financing (the other main chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of 'addictivity' or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting their hopes in the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Koscius-Morizet, who is coming to Cancún next week.
The surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "addictivity" and the use of loans could raise the level of international confidence necessary to further advance the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that the kids are about to miss.
A 10-year-old child will one day see 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which notes that its results "are not of significant statistical value given the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the problem being processed", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sugars, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting agents.
The balance of the plate is devastating: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as carcinogens, possible or probable, and five substances are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal mixing glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we well see that the reality of exposure of consumers to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagious," the association states.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residiums with possible carcinogenic effects and three shown as certain carcinogenics, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, listed as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunch, in which studies revealed traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, beef from minced meat, tuna in cans, and even goose and gum were smuggled pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrates and chloroform was revealed in the water from the corner of the analysis.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminants cocktail" is likely to be underestimated", results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Community (EE-LV) has proposed "a face-to-face emergency situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increasing of civilisation diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) surveyed the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereal.
