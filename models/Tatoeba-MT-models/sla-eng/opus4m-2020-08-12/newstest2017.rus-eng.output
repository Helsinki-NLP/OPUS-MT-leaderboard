Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
The international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandian polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye cartilage of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, over five metres long, may be 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the longevity of the shark.
Female Greenlandese sharks are only 150 years old.
In the past, it was thought that the "neighbor" of the sharks lived longer than all vertebrate animals, a Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Sovbez RF.

Should we go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of Olga Bogus Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanitary rest is needed not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get advice from a doctor as to how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations would not be unnecessary to anyone.
"I'm just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it's not to be wavered.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is about 90 percent of the people who come.
In addition, he is most vulnerable to large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and let yourself get some rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age while in the sanitarium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to have a vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures shall be determined by the physician, taking into account the individual testimony and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanitariums there is usually a children's club with cartoons where children can attend games classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for visitors with babies, provide the midwives with the necessary conditions and provide services to an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days per year (over 300) creates good conditions for 24-year vacations at the Caucasus Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs more than just summer rest.
So there is no need to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main fiche of the Caucasus Mineral Water region, of course, is the healing mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects the various systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, quantity of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Narzan, for example, has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastric tract, lowers the sugar level.
Essentuki new has anti-inflammation, bile and urea.
The waters of Slavyanovska also have the same effects.
When water is appointed, the physician must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salt water because the salts hold the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Different cosmetological procedures for the individual and the body are now available in the sanatoriums.
What types of health based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of the region?
Near Petigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake called Tambukan, which is used for joints, vertebrates, and internal organs.
It produces an anti-inflammatory, suction, immunomodulatory action.
These are health walks on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
There you can also take baths with wine, pearly, yogurt, selenium, scarf and lacquer depending on what your doctor will assign you.
Prolonged fertility.
What can you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopukhova, agronomist and midwife.
It is time for the tomato to make a cut: to remove the new pastures, to cut the noodles, to remove all the leaves to the last cyst with fruit and a flower with small bandages, they will not be able to mature.
All tomatoes, regardless of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with a salt-superphosphate extract, processed by bio-products (The Maturator - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktophyte - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacylline, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, only copper kale, colloidal cheese and green soap should be used.
We're making the last stream of plants.
The long-skinned cucumbers in the heat are sprayed from the wallpapers so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) will lie on the ground, watered with warm water and zircon solution, and sprinkled 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also not difficult to prolong the yield of the kabob: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, and pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect from night colds, place the arc over the curve with the hidden material.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close the sun after sundown.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in twenty years.
As reported by Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of the RF has shown a positive trend - in the second quarter of GDP has declined by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The Central Bank and Mineconomy of Development have also recently declared that the situation has been stabilized.
In the front, slow growth.
According to CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of the Russian GDP suggests that the recession remains behind and that the economy will grow slowly ahead of time,” says the Bank of Russia’s newspaper “What Trends Say”.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter by regulators increased to 0.4 per cent, with an estimate of 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
According to the representative of Mineconomy, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP in the RF was 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15", quoted by the representative of the MER RIA News.
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the bottom is “over”.
Among other markers for the recovery of the national economy, Bloomberg refers to the increase in electricity demand and rail transport, business recovery.
If a correction is made to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the trend in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be due to an additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus-minus 0.5 per cent of the six-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
After all, there are other more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, Rosstat has been deflationing the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble course, which, although showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has been strengthened by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Jakovenko stresses.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the RF since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
A positive trend is also demonstrated in the labour market, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population is left to the best.
Annually, the figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can hamper economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
In the economic structure, they tend to exceed 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strict policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator retains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not affect the real sector in the best way.
A negative factor is the low level of investment, which hampers the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it is expected that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the RF economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3,7 per cent in 2015," says analyst GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-inhabited in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so active in summer sports.
If former foreigners speak in the Olympics in Rio for Russia, in most cases they are the nationals of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
In Rio de Janeiro, however, we can see the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians speak under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality differs.
Someone was taken to another country as a child without a choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a seat in a Russian assembly.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
Aif.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In a German passport, a 27-year-old girl says her name is Liza Ryzhich.
But before, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in her older sister’s footsteps in athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose jumps with six.
Stay in Russia, I don't think she'd be able to "move off the throne" Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, the Rio Lisa Olympics will be our only landlady, even our ex, in the sixth jump sector.
Its best achievements in this form are the 2010 European Bronze Championship and the continental silver championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado-Springs, where she continued her studies under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Izbodnikov, at the U.S. Anti-Teaching Centre.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the world championship that same year, it's a victory.
Prior to that, it had won the 2010 world silver championship.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the town of Jaroslavle, where she was first introduced to synchronized swimming.
But saying that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
She soon joined the U.S. Assembly and showed excellent results at the Pan-American Games.
It is understandable that at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America its performance is a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching girls artistic gymnastics across the ocean.
Up to this point, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her hometown of Jaroslavla.
After emigrating to the U.S., she quickly joined the country’s youth camp and later joined the main national team.
At the Pan-American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first position on the world stage, of course, she didn't have to fight, but for the United States, she made a real breakthrough -- she put out a star-gauge band at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former artists is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany.
She was born in Toliatta.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to enter the national assembly.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is true that Jana was able to occupy only 17 seats, which were not enough to compete in the finals in the personal championship.
Two years earlier, however, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games.
One more gymnast, only this time sportswoman is Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier can be called standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a teacher of the Volgograd Sports School.
In Iceland, of course, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira's training in Russia, but she's coming to her country on her own, so she doesn't lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not act as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in personal combat.
There is very little information on Maria Cologne's float in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, it was under the Russian flag, showing good results - even a country record of 200 metres of Butterflies.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the Red and White flag.
In Rio, its best performance is 14th place in the 4x100 integrated relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that enabled her to raise about 6,000 francs to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter named Adam Batirov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasawurt’s native succeeded in becoming a three-time prize winner of the European Championships, the Russian champion of the international class of Russian sports.
When he stopped going to our National Assembly, it was time to consider changing nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports stations.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship, Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian man, Mikhail Kudinov, is known even less in his homeland than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, its best result was 40 seats in parallel bras.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games in sports gymnasts are a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her lessons in synchronized navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronized navigation.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was in the salt program fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter is in favour of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitry had already become the country's champion at 17.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croiter also wins the gold of the young Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry handles long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasawurt national who, after long speeches for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he was in favour of the Krasnoyarska High School of Sports, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
A 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a USSR member of the volleyball team Jaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before his son Jaroslav was born, he was recognized as the world’s best volleyball player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The same family stayed for permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a bronze prizer of the European Championship in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was reunited with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was originally targeted, but it was not possible to reach this northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free combat.
He soon won the world championship among juniors and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the combat tournament.
And once again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time it will be about the Northern Ossetian citizen who emigrated to Spain, Timuraz Freeyev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the country ' s assembly team.
Prior to that, a 30-year-old athlete had also achieved high results in Russia.
He became the bronze champion of the country in 2007 and 2008.
The charter of non-congregation, Timuras decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Chechnya boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestana Mahachkal, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has become Canada's champion three times, and in 2012 he has become the champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the Pan-American Games gold, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why are the children in school?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "the saying is not by action and parade, but by systematic means."
They must grow up and understand from at least 7 years of age that they are fairy tales and education.
But as long as I think this work is going on formally, I suspect it's more on paper.
If the fairy-tale classes take on all the positive things that were previously accumulated at a qualitatively new level, I'd be happy.
If everyone gets high and doesn't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The JCC continues to be one of the country ' s most criminal sectors of the economy.
There is an attack on funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budget.
According to the Henprocurator ' s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of GCC.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles to energy.
In the days that followed, the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region found that the tariffs were unwarranted.
A total of 4 million roubles were charged to hire vehicles at a price higher than the market price in the IP-consulting (cold water).
And such examples on the land of mass.
The people pay for the “communal” of the last money, and it pays correctly, according to the Ministry of Finance, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Criminal Code: the crackdown, the legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, the abuse of power, etc.
On the basis of the investigation, Makarov, as the head of the fund for the repair of urban facilities, had concluded contracts with entrepreneurs and had not actually worked on them but had been paid.
Businessmen just gave him most of his money back.
As the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay the service providers and spend it on his own.
As a result, millions of roubles have been damaged by the budget and the inhabitants.
Makarov's machination scheme, earrings, is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the head of the Criminal Code, who were taking the money of the citizens.
Kamchatka continues the trial against A. Kohan, by the way, also a former member of the Horsovite, who is accused of machining for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation version, in 2012-2013 he established 6 management companies in Elizovo Kamchatsk region and created 3 limited-liability societies.
One of them was performing contractual work for the CC, and two others played a role in the clearing house, i.e. they took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not list the funds, but he did spend it on himself, a loved one.
It's quite difficult to judge in the area of the GCC.
Cases don't get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this very complicated housing legislation, according to Svetlana Razvornev, Executive Director of the NP "PKH Control".
We are failing to earn one law, as we are making a new one, which should force the previous one to work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on JCX issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law is given very little attention in universities.
The denial of criminal proceedings, the trains in the course of the investigations, are also referred to in the Attorney-General ' s Office.
Out of the 3.5 thousand crimes in production in 2015, less than half of them were sent to the court.
The rest of the investigation was delayed and one in five was suspended for failure to identify the accused.
The shortcomings in law enforcement work are often offset by gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities of inquiry are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, only 60 criminal cases were filed.
In the five months of the current year, only a slight increase was made in the number of them.
What, though, is the falsification of the housing record?
This means that the change in household management, financial and other matters go around the opinion of the owners.
This also means that normal companies who want to work honestly cannot break into the housing and utilities market, rather than “kid” the population.
It turns out, the tenants are down, so is the small and medium-sized business.
First of all, through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State ' s Property Committee, is confident.
This work is now being carried out actively.
It's not just single shares, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there are no scandals in the capital.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of the GCC as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government has shown iron will and order, said Anatoly the Electoral, a member of the Committee of the State for Security and Anti-Corruption of Corruption.
I mean both the staffing issue and the legislative amendments and legal education.
Management companies have been closely supervised and have all been licensed.
Complaints by citizens are quickly resolved in public space (and residents ' treatment and response measures are placed on the Moscow Government's portal).
Many not only pay monthly bills but also carefully monitor what is written in the home.
Awareness among the public of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks on the validity of housing-communal tariffs, as a large part of the budget goes to grants and benefits for many categories of the population.
Perhaps all of this together explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is it true that everything is in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the unemployed should switch jobs?
Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put forward an ultimatum for the United States, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing the coup d'état.
That is what he stated, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support to the “terrorist organization of Fethullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the United States to change its position.
Experts believe that Turkey ' s relationship with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Early or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (“Terrorist Organization of Fethullachists”).
It is either the organizing of the FETO coups or the democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," the Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan as saying Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but has already demanded that the United States comply with his request, which was first sounded to them immediately after the insurgency was suppressed.
It will be recalled that on the night of 16 July Turkey, a high-ranking Turkish army had attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of State.
However, after Recep Erdogan had addressed the population, the riot was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In all, some 8,000 people were suspected, with teachers and scientists in addition to the military.
According to Rexhep Erdogan, they were mentored by Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogan's supporters also assumed that American people could be involved in the coup.
All claims were denied by refusing to issue Gulen and advising the change of tone.
The last statement made by Gosdep in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also demands on other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date of lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens”, EU Minister Omer Celik said on 9 August.
He said that amending Ankara's anti-terrorist law, as requested by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Let us note that on 1 August, German Deputy Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union by promising to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate visa regimes with the EU.
His words responded to the relevant statement made by Head Mevluta Chavusoglu of Turkey.
Another provocative statement Chavusoglu made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish MlD did not exclude that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign States in the defence area -- they import missiles," said Chavusoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others”, the minister said.
Experts believe that all of this suggests Turkey's serious differences with the West and the country's re-orientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Research, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is playing his game now and cannot go to a hard confrontation with the West.
He is very committed to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more comfortable for Americans to see a fully obedient person on this post," explained Aif.ru.
He said it was not excluded that following statements by the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensation, on visa-free space with Europe and on the extradition of Gulen from the United States) he would be pressured.
"Rjep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial governance and so on," Minchenko believes.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his view of relations with Russia as soon as he can benefit.
Eight months ago Erdogan took a very hard stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very short period of time, the situation changed to the opposite.
Guarantees that, after a while, the President of Turkey has not changed his priorities again, no.
I think Erdogan entered a period of boat diplomacy.
After being between the two poles - the West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," says Muhin.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today was to retain political power in the country, which is precisely why he needed Russia and the partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazov, is of a different perspective.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are now quite tense, especially with regard to the internal policies that Erdogan is pursuing personally.
I believe that this crisis will exacerbate relations, and against the backdrop of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are willing to change their position on a number of issues concerning Syria, that relations with Israel are resolved, that there is an active political interaction with Iran” - explained Aif.ru Glasz, who admitted that the next step of Erdogan would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is currently pursuing is a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"Then, in the positions of 'no problems with neighbours', Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
There have been very good visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions in both the regional and international arenas," the expert believes.
Glasov believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, now the question is whether the EU will start to answer Turkey firmly, which can open borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
The representatives of the junior doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new labour contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Committee of Assistant Doctors (JDC) intends to request its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers had not been able to answer questions about the employment contract.
In July, junior doctors and medical students voted in favour of abolishing the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to “stand silent” about the problems it had said had led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said: “In taking account of the situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues.”
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader today made an official request for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to approve a continuing programme of expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first general attacks in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA's junior medical leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after the vote to abolish the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good deal to be taken during the pre-vote meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Bad Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counterpart to the golden palace in St. Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed strained, and he hardly elicited heat even according to his own contained standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke on several occasions about his "road of the other" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I've lost my check.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the lingering cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey had defeated a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was inexorable.
Mr. Putin was upset by the angry tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the State carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be held responsible for everything.
The most serious were allegations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had been involved in the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal, which was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost thrown off his post last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly rocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The number has dropped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're putting the season at the peak on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," according to the news report.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil to the West for calling it a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent at the cranial pace of EU accession talks and the move of Mr. Putin — who seeks to use the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonuses with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities following the coup d'état.
Remember, this is data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant seafront palace allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described as a "bad alliance" to me: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
Syria is key, where Moscow has recently placed itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
Perhaps he speaks for himself that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language for Syria.
But after months of open hostility -- and given the possibility of a complete disaster when a NATO member of Turkey knocked down a Russian rocket fighter -- it is best that two leaders at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be reduced to a back office, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has withdrawn from them since it collapsed almost eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of international sports sponsorship, from the six-nation rugby cup to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller banking brands for individuals who will receive more influence — Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed during a tour of clients and staff to Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC: “Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one where our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring support to the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"It's a good time for us to move the brand bank because basically (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great customer bank and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on customer needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in New Market on the Addiction
The children spray champagne after a double in New Market leads it to 3,000 victories.
Jockey Franky Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track on Addiction, trained by John Goden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lester Piggott, Pete Iddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Dettor's jockeys, who had won the Ghayyar before, said, "That's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm really glad it happened in New Market, because that's where I moved in 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm off the case and very unattractive.
The children receive applause when they bring Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys scored in the obstacle jumps: the champion of the jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, derby's nine-time winner, 4,493 career victories
Franky is one of the best jockeys of the modern age, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical juice that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for the jumps, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't only been the jockey of weekends and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to Britain for over 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a speedy jump from his horse
From fast finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was a takeoff and a fall.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his famous "Big Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while — Children said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin fires head of the Administration, Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of the Administration, Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the trusted neighborship of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for environment and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin states that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration”, but did not state the reason.
Since 2012, Mr. Ivanov's deputy, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital city of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MIGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
He was later the head of the President's and Government's Office's protocol, reporting to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting laws and in monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to leave his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
This is the move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, has served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it convinced few people — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So these are the unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
So far, no one knows.
But the official statement — that a person who was once advocated as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with great skepticism.
In the comments of Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012, I asked you to talk to me about this very difficult position, even if you might say, a problem position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I've been the head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who had replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since the third deadline for Putin would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was held by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency only three and a half years later.
"Thinking as a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer
Gibson was in the Los Angeles show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative disagreements about the shootings and disagreements in opinions.
I regret that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be erased from a show that monitors the FBI agents' team is expected to come later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom was on the show since the first season of 2005.
"I love "Thinking as a criminal" and have invested my heart and soul in it for the past 12 years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but now it won't be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, above all, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could have been sands left behind by water.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, exposed the scene to Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two - inch [2.5 cm] fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The 1.35 billion-pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers connected the north spring and the Quinsferry Crossing viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the "veers of the canvas" that are now approaching the completion of all three saws of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The 1.35 billion-pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to engineering, truly epic in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and became used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the draw between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete coating is being poured into Rosati today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to be lifted at the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first twist on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, it is the most modern building art.
After the last section of the road canvas was installed and connected to the expanding road canvas of the Northern Pillar, we were left to close the remaining glare on the north — or toward the shore — side.
This was done by pulling a north-facing viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a large and at the same time a very elegant operation.
Large, because a 222-meter-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of about 3%.
Exquisite, because the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
Three men are lucky to be alive.
Three men were lucky to be alive after being thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The rescue station Moelfre RNLI raised an alarm at 13:20 a.m. on British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfr Bay.
Three men tried their best to reach a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship circle around them and assume the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, a lifeboat driver.
“ Fortunately, by the time we went down on the water, a strong wind had driven him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man was found impoverished for 60 years and plunged into a storm without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard a shoreboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but somehow it was detached from the man who was driving the boat when it woke up.
Someone's been watching these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a Deserving Hunt for Health and Happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time on screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and involves some physical activity.
The time on the screen was originally limited by television, video games, and smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to Pokémon Go, an application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the resulting series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this lost its relevance a little earlier than the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to the massive response that had overloaded the servers.
On the counted days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, the smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons who are GPS-tracked, and when they're found, they can be 'photographed' (through a screen shot on your phone) or 'captured'.
The generation, who played the game when they were younger, joined in the pursuit of pleasure by pulling away from the couches to search.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that ordinary people take on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people being monitored every day who performed 30 minutes of exercise jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on how the levels go.
Many health campaigns, which convince people to “find 30 minutes”, “get off the couch” and “be active every day”, have not responded because most health-care messages are boring and express themselves to people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it brings people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because despite the fact that apps for smartphones, such as Fitbit, could track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to do what this game does.
The new one will come, and the use will weaken in time.
But because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bailes wins the gold of absolute primacy in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the mess.
Simone Bailes is invulnerable for all of this.
It's dynamic on the base jump.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of the absolute champion on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was well removed from the silver medalist and teammate Eli Riceman and the Russian bronze medalist Alicia Mustafana.
Bales from the United States plays on a gymnast at the final of the women's individual absolute championship for artistic gymnastics in 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the championship of the absolute championship and fifth in general, earning her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly ever.
She was crying when her final general score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts it in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bailes has spent the last three years dominating in her form of sports, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their mixture of hard work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympics champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, not so much between Bailes and the others in this area as between her and the burden of expectations.
Anything less than going back to my family's house in Spring, Texas, with a bunch of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Bailes of the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the women's individual absolute championship for artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bailes made her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the National Assembly Coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the summit, that is not the case.
Part of her free exercise program — one that includes her company’s passageway — is set up for Latin American music, which would go straight like a house on the street just outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, who were beginning to walk and opened to Coach Amy Burman’s mother during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost any competition in the absolute championship since the summer of 2013, a lane that should last as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafa received a small advantage through two rotations, it was a mirage.
The gymnast and free exercise — where Bailes defends the title of the world’s champion — lie at stake.
She moved forward again from 15,433 on the log and ended up with 15,933 on the floor.
Rysman hugged her gently while they were waiting for the final account — a pure formality — and tears appeared around a bright red with a white and blue eye patch for Bailes when the idea she had once recorded in the album for clippings came true.
Rysman's speech was a small revenge four years ago when she shared third place, but lost the bronze by Mustafa on a tai-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "grandmother" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As far as Bailes is concerned, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack in the first serial killer Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked in a carriageway, the authorities said.
The criminal fired about eight gunshots from a gun, standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he hid on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that triple homicide appears not to be the result of a robbery, since the perp did not take a purse or $2,900 that was available to one of the adult victims.
A representative of the Phoenix Police Department, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting prompted the investigators to check if he had been associated with the four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
“It’s in the residential area in front of the house,” said KPHO, the CBS branch office, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died instantly.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the aim of which was an empty truck half an hour before the triple murder and which was believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and pulled the bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "Better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign that.
Which, in fact, is not true - of course you sign it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put him in a specialized medical facility.
“My first answer was, ‘I didn’t think people would do that anymore,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund's walking through the walkways.
Edmund didn't sit around and crawl until he was three, and he's still not talking.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with foreign help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund made for "please sing to me."
“ We teach his sign language, ” said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just a simple sign language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmund’s infection during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeka.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeka virus.
Pixiuto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I told you all the time what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers with birth defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south of Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened by massive flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor of Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and the aid had already gone to the affected arrivals.
Mike Steele, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for high-water transport, boats and sandbags were received.
Steele said that only Tanjipahoa's arrival had asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The risk of flooding remains in effect until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
Weather Service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could invade the area.
In southern Alabama, on-call duty was in effect until Friday, as it continued to rain in the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, was projected to set a record of flood levels in the past weekend.
Synaptist Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding going down the stream in Assensenchen's arrival was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly stream into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever registered levels at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the floods in the districts of Amit and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another stepdaughter who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest inflow she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family were disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued all three of them with the help of an army truck and took them to the fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is “swift” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingston reported a 13.75-inch drop from midnight till Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was overcrowded with rainwater from the middle.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in Tangipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities claim.
WWL, the CBS branch, reports that the adviser to Tanjipahoa described 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but both are now being immersed.
The president of Robbie Miller's visit said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Ammit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In Hammond, the arrival of Tanjipahoa was closed to about two dozen streets because of high water levels, and sandbags were accessible to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rain was still on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Emit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tawson, "and it's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "resolved by bullets", remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a 6-year-old shooting in the city this week.
His grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown got multiple gunshot wounds, including his scent, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of work, his little body has been cut off with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has survived several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He had to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four men who were shot in the Germantown district.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to Philadelphia CBS.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to the Philadelphia CBS that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapons casings attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have cleared the scene of action.
It seems to have been a long battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting, ” said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in this area have also been hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly watching video cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand of a swinging bullet on Tuesday, playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call a female Olympic gymnasium this year and for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, three gymnasts play a key role: Simone Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Lori Hernández, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this composite, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like America at last.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were Nos.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the last Gabby Douglas Olympics, he was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
The world could now witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simona Bailes, Douglas and Lori Hernández, performing unexpected yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a woman’s individual absolute championship.
And a colleague of mine, Eli Reisman, earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ellie and Madison to form the Olympic Assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnast will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But in reality gymnastics is expensive sports, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay for the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is a costly and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach Simone Bailes, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Hernández, both trained their athletes from the moment they accepted gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable training for the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Latin American) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics, which deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to tedious work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has had a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this gathering that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that is wonderful.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the team's Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have launched further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing on a revised treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, said that NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors were transferred to a new contract, which included changes in working hours and weekends to improve out-of-time service.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Physicians, said in a statement yesterday evening: “The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will support the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
Only eight weeks remain before the first team of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is needed.
The WMA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute was met with the reluctance to act and sometimes with total silence from the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are clear that they are ready to make subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April brought about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for the weekends for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employees, urged the junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "Stands are achieved little or nothing, but they put pressure on already working teams and services, and cause concern, physical pain and disorder to patients, residents and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Assistant Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after career breaks, learning costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differentials in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions achieved by WMA in November, February and May.
A £2 drug a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attacks are going to use the drug for £2 a day after the authorities have recommended giving it to more people and for longer periods.
Ticagrelor, an anti-retropy drug, reduces the risk of repeated seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new seizure.
The NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs to some 140,000 people in England annually, with a fourth of them having another stroke or stroke.
Cardiac seizures and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of bottles.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a thromboembolism that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
A ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, a British company called Brilique, reduces the risk by making it less likely.
The draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited after the expiration of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for more than that period.
The culture of ownership of the PC allows for the development of counterfeiting of vote numbers in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving as a pushover for the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive report of the Government announced today.
Former cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, has been criticized by police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local community, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of voters on a religious basis was so strong that the police had to allow borders outside the polling stations to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters should only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting unsmileable inks on people's fingers when they hand over their ballot papers in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups to the press.
“This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlet, East London.
Last year, the Special Court dealing with electoral matters decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office owing to the long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “sinically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman was said to have “led his campaign based on the duty of Muslims to vote for him”.
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or were the result of the personage when a person votes to represent someone else.
Sir Eric said there were frauds all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about the fraud of voting by post, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote in favour of their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, in his photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are
The report states: “Proposals of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, were provided to vote at the will of the elderly, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from postage ballots to stop “vote harvesting”.
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privilege.
The option is considered to require voters to present a identification before the vote.
Use the unscrupulous ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Insert a three-year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting.
Eliminate political actors in campaigns and activists from working with closed ballots and mail-vote envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around the polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the 1983 submission of the People ' s Act.
Take illegal photographs at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go in one box at a time.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that this is “amazing” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlet case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts”, he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
It also criticises the ineffective “checks for a branch” of the electoral registration offices of the city administrations.
Sir Eric stated: "Last year's ruling at the Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the condition of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy as a bicycle analogy to Kate and the other Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic fans in Rio this week went crazy on French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who appeared to be quite strikingly like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old participant in the Olympic Games is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double, at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities on our screens at this time, the F EMAIL has created a list of Olympics that are more than superficially similar to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the U.S. men's team, Brady Ellison, on the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on a bicycle track, many online people have rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio’s superstar.
A member of the U.S. men's team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of the twitter hurricane, after images of it appeared frighteningly similar to the star Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer found out about the madness of the socialists and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe except for face vegetation," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly show even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British jumper Greg Razerford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafan, with her big eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Bourga, they've been comparing the Horus to Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: This user thinks that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who may boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julius Efimov, can boast not only of the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress Anna Linn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, says the fans, looks like the "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte".
Raw Women: Hope Solo Football Star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently came to the site to announce her admiration that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linny, as well as the winning gold medal by Gabby Douglas, who can boast her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of star Gabriel Union.
The Olympics commentator at CBC apologizes for speaking of the Chinese float "died like a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of fourth place in the final 14-year-old Ay Yanhan on a 4x200-m women's esteaf upset the CBC audience on a live broadcast by the Olympics
Canada's CBC broadcaster was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese floater "started up like a smell" and "died like a pig" during the flood.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m freestyle.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought to the CBC commentators' team to "split it in color", said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
She was too excited, too excited, too excited to start like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, aged 14, sailed the second stage of the relay in 1:57,79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to get rid of China’s backlog.
Canadian-wide viewers quickly responded to the network after being shaken by the tone and expression used
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC dictator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China, in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately attacked Byron McDonald, and many urged him to fire him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sara Paradiz, wrote: 'It's okay #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who was broadcasting the CBC, apologized directly for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the fact that the comment on the float was on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
Commentary's friend Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald's face.
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The calf also rushed to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers on live television and our subscribers in social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about speaking to the floater, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think that his words interpreted him as an attack on a person.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's esthephet,' he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
'I was talking about a floater, not a personal one.'
'Of course there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly used underwear in the middle of a store.
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman got naked to try underpants on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she illustrated what she looked like in them, pulled them down, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually moved four pairs of underwear to the Bouverie Place mall in Volkswagen.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place in Folkston, where a woman used to put her underpants before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at the time, said that after a sample of underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the storeroom, she took a pair of panties off the window, took off her own slippers and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find someplace modest to do it -- she was just standing there, shy."
"It was settled when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked to wear and leave again.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching her or what she thought of the person who would eventually buy those panties she was doing."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "How do I hate to think someone's going to take home the panties someone else was wearing, and they weren't posted."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left -- well, better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out what another woman put on and took them off, and they weren't posted."
The representative of Primark reported: “Primark knows about the incident that took place in our shop in Volkswagen on Tuesday 9 August”.
All the goods in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assault with a gun, using a cow mahogany
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misracci, the magistrate of the Federation of Cows in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Miserci, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you tighten the gun between your shoulders and your shoulders before you punch them in the face with a free elbow.
Then you're knee-deep in the smell, and as the attacker bends away from the pain, you pull the gun out of his hand, you punch him in the face with a gun, and you walk back, holding the gun on him.
For an armed, suitable front, a method of execution similar to that, remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest with your fist, then pull the gun out of its grip before you step back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Misarchy does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a master cow master -- is to give away your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Jan Wright speaks his own language in the dirtiest places in Europe.
The British traveler has put his immune system and the gnarly reflex to serious test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of books on the travels of Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolka, spoke the euro banknote, the pearls of Zirka Piccadily, the button of the toilets on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which should become a movie called "Lesson Traveler's Manual on the Internal Force", has produced some amazing results.
The idea of slipping the washing button on a train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but in fact, there are worse bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and nurses about the increase in gastrointestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked brought him more than bad taste in the mouth.
Wright became famous for his intestinal strength tests, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From public laundry at the stations to the wash button of the toilet, this task certainly tested his immune system
In the film he made, he said, 'I was completely carefree from my health from childhood, and I dragged many things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he gave up was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test lubricant has shown a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000, while just washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a movie about a traveler called “Lesson Traveler’s Guide to the Internal Force”, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
He said in the film, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lesson Traveler's Manual on the Internal Force" was removed together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestines and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Wuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the intestine and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information on this in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's just say that I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the movie."
Of course, some things to Jan were easier to lick, and some were rather rigid.
I'm glad some of these licks got us on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to the good condition of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they use at least sometimes products containing added acid bacteria.
The Hulligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, just before the eviction.
The hooligans left their municipal home with a loss of £50,000 after being evicted for intimidation by their neighbors.
Tania Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the real estate facility, shocked housing and construction officials found the property in a state that required repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, half opened, the garbage was scattered over the floor, and the walls were embossed with graffiti.
The family is now displaced and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, the settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this object of real estate is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple had three sons who had lived in a real estate site from time to time, and the police reported that the reign of horror caused by the family had included fighting in the streets with baseball beats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, disputes and mockery.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial conduct in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be demolished found old garbage
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
Exodus was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here, it's amazing.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Unit, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the hill on the side of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, since eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, since the conduct was limitless, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and the members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will provide some comfort to the neighbours and signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms at home after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as weights, supplies and $1,700 cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money was paid for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms at home were paved with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with the renting rules.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without the prosecution's accusations and those who are harmed by such behaviour', she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low - flying warplane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to indulge in the sun were fearful of their lives.
The aircraft P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while a low - flying plane is prying over an overcrowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand lane in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Restorers jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for good reason, concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but unable to see what was going on in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night not far from the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few vacationers who published a video of a shocking passing in social networks, said, "He flew down pretty low twice, and there was a moment when he seemed to break up."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were horribly frightened when the plane came out of the mist and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was engaged in a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had been forced to descend so low as this was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown slightly lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — dense fog and smog from forest fires that made it worse
The aircraft carried out a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the assignment
HasSP has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active and fines up to 1 million rubles are at risk for business.
For more than a year now, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) - risk analysis and critical checkpoints - are mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as general interrogation companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Business checks by Rosobrenaissant began in February 2015 to comply with these standards in Petersburg.
But as long as officials are fined only for individual violations of the rules (see “List of documents”).
In general, failure to comply with the regulation would cost 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HasSP, as a system that takes into account the risks of food use and prevents it, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food businesses not only in the United States but in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on the territory of the TC.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business was 4 years old (the requirement of the HASSP appeared in the TC technology in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, for a long time we were convinced that the norm concerned only food production, not restaurants,” explained the head of the Public Council, Elena Cereteli.
Now everyone's trying to figure out what's missing.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey, late August, early September.
But they won't be able to demand it, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already getting ready for school, experts say.
The Tourism Agency Alliance sent a letter yesterday asking the Government to authorize charters.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting quality and affordable sea rest is indistinguishable, as most accommodation facilities are already banned at the resorts of the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Crimea by the end of September”, the authors note, stressing that the opening of charter services in August will not significantly affect the demand for Russian maritime products.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), if the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are renewed, is largely dependent on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly build programmes and agree with the airlines on what is needed in the direction of the ships," said Pavel Rumyansev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it would not have much effect on the placement of forces on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from rest and were preparing for school or were taking vacations in other countries.
During the shabby season, tours are usually bought by single travelers and couples.
Charter programmes can count on those who have a chance to rest spontaneously," said Paul Rumyans.
"There is a chance for Turkey to attract many tourists if it now makes very budget proposals -- 50,000-60,000 rubles per tour on two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director-General of Tourism Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, there is no way to expect a ride, and the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be needed, but no wait for a ride.
"For Turkey, starting charters is now a rehearsal for the next season," said Pavel Rumyansev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season”, agreed Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of compensation payments from NDFs established by law within the approved rules relating to compensation for injury caused by injury or other harm to health.
The provision of milk under the established rules for workers employed in working with harmful working conditions is article 222 TC RF.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of extradition are laid down by order No. 45n of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful productive factors in the workplace.
On the basis of those rules, the Russian Federation FNC concluded in the letter under consideration that, pursuant to paragraph 2(3) of article 217 of the RF, incomes in the form of milk issued to employees on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions under the Norms and conditions approved by the Russian Ministry of Health order of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's Gazstrobank lost its CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the licence to conduct banking operations with the credit organization Shareholder Commercial Bank Gasstroybank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the AAC "GASTRAYBANK" has implemented a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets led to the creation of a credit organization ' s basis for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank appointed a temporary administration until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive branch of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
The ACS "Gasstroybank" is a participant in the insurance system of the deposits.
It will be recalled that the payment of insurance to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ “On insurance of the contributions of natural persons to banks of the Russian Federation” is provided for in the amount of 100% of the balance of the funds, but not more than 1.4 million rbs per investor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, the assets of the AAB "Gazstroybank" as at 1 August 2016 accounted for 335 positions in the RF banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said that her family found out about her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is expected to have died from a Russian air strike in Rakka, a plot by a group in the country, according to ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“It is only to be hoped that the only advantage of this is as a tombstone and a will to others, that these are the risks involved in travelling to the war zone, to persuade people to make the same choice at any time,” said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and then took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultans were told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had been a widow for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, but President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group at the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will elect the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at the conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Representative Reed later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to make Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton wouldn't want to "screw the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reed stated that the Republicans who were blocking the nomination of Garland were the "admissions" and "assistants" of the Republican candidate to President Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was not suitable for the post.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The magazine Treats collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to a demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman’s body,” said Shaw in a press release proclaiming the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be given reminders of inconspicuous Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to release a monument to tell us how not to be a victim of an Internet store.
That's what was reported in Rosobnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that departmental experts are preparing a monument that will help citizens to properly select online stores and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules on the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim properly and so on," said Rosobnadzor.
The memory is being refined so far.
It will then be posted on the Rosobnadzdora site in Moscow and is also scheduled to release a print version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement naming the second suspect in the organization of the diversion to Crimea.
Persons belonging to Ukrainian and Russian nationals who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Zacrej Andrey Romanovich.
“They all give confessions,” says the communication.
Formerly, the resident of the Zaporozhye district of Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt for questioning.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google of 438 million roubles, according to the agency's website.
“The fine for Google for violating antitrust legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon," said FAS Deputy Manager Alexei Docenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers sold in Russia with the Google Play Apps store only if other corporate applications were installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine that should be installed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Competition Protection Act (abuse of dominant status).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulation will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile IP market, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose production is supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including," said the head of the Communications and Information Technology Management Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The board suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The New Bookstore network is fined for selling the Stace Kramer book "50 Days Before My Suicide", reports the Moscow City News Agency.
The text of the book can be regarded as “provoking or motivating to the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents,” as reported in Rosobnadzd.
The Stalin District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rosobnadzor Office.
The source at the New Bookstore confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow’s largest bookstores were being checked for “50 days before my suicide”.
The night of Ernst the Unknown will be in Moscow.
In Moscow it will be the night of the memory of the sculptor Ernst the Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Literators.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to arrange this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their home land," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
There it was noted that it was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
On the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Evgeny Evtushenko, artist Boris Messererer, the President of Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rozovsky, and Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Culture Department, Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pečatnikov.
Previously, it was reported that Ernst the Unknown's relatives were planning to conduct a panicoid on a sculpture in New York, presumably until 14 August.
The end user blamed: who actually buys the plates?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you've decided to squander the section of the comments with gross insults under the alias Not All Single Men Middle Years, this statement comes from actual data.
According to YouGov, so many of the albums discussed are due not to the boom among the two-thousand generations who want to penetrate the new material, but to medium-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability range from 45 to 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group 18-24 are the least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering lovers - it is of emotional importance: older buyers of guilt are more likely to keep their feelings inside (56 per cent versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are youGov's results true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of a lively Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and a gesturing before the stop, folding my hands and saying, "Well, let's have a look."
All right, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly depriving itself of its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, paperchase stores have now taken hold of buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic professionals remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to the different people in some of these stores, and I'm trying to evaluate their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgo Stewart, 55 years old, whom I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London at midday to meet, and walks around shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he e-mailed me the pictures, I didn't chase him to the house), follow the lines on the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they came out and buy the items he sold when he was young and small.
"Many of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the early '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He noted, however, a new wave of people under the influence of noise in the media, people who had heard of the return and felt the obligation to buy their old records.
According to the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection in about 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he said.
This may explain the boom among resurgents of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some older clients, in particular, are insulted by a cash-free payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel shaken by the digital world and prefer to move away from the familiar envelopes for records, items that bring back memories of unbridled youth.
“I think that sometimes it can be filling the void or possessing material things as a kind of tranquillity, ” says Wez.
Since I'm a collector, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
“We’re like their social workers!” said a colleague from the stacking of records.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, while 7 per cent of those who bought the wine had no record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by the ploughing of the collections of Bosanowa.
The "Trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny noticed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead record so that we can put it in front of us," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More components, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, older people, a little less than 20, who only get to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores — the latest synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast — rather than jazz improvisation, it is a pleasure to see diversity in your clients.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to establish a painful psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27 years old, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she said, so collecting records isn't a good option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of it is just..." - It plunges into dreams with a breathful of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans overcoating shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid chamber every minute before my father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is the staircase, which is set with the plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Weinhouse and Flytwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plates for any medium collection.
No one is watching — perhaps because they are merely adornment, some so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artificial vinyl."
But given that any attention to these objects can mean more money for the industry and send several clients to the depths of Soho for a while, there is little to complain about.
No wonder that a segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people have is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings show that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and wine lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably all work in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the mornings of Thursday walking around a record store on Berwick Street, leafing records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark — the longest-lived vertebrate animal — video
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the longest life span of all the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female record was between 272 and 512 years old and 5 meters long.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of self-produced shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week's trial, the authorities of Kale said that the State should be able to bring down a total of 72 self-produced shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to shave or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for several euros in self-produced restaurants.
The Prefecture of Kale said that these places should be reduced because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, stating that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that self - made shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Court of Lille found that there was no legal basis for expelling 72 self-managed shops, but stated that the problems of Prefecture Kale “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that baccales, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely harsh conditions”.
He said that the spaces provided a peaceful meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was at risk of demolition was the Children's Book of the Jungle at the camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and consultations on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not more than eight years old”.
Two charities, Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number in Jungle camp had grown and exceeded 9,000 — the highest in history — after a dramatic increase in arrivals during the summer.
The microregion libraries invite young freemen to study programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings on City Day, Russian Film Year and even Physiculturist Day.
The programmes are aimed at children's audiences, so most of them will be in play.
Today, 10 August, the branch library No. 2, in the valley area, invites my small town to a cruise presentation.
On August 11th, at the branch library No. 1 there will be an end-of-life watch "I live in this city, I know this city."
A multimedia lesson entitled “Land of the Past” will be held at the branch library No. 2 on the same day.
And at the No. 4 library in Surazevka, it's a film, film, film game.
On Sunday, 14 August, for the north microregion, the branch library No. 3 will conduct the play programme “Physcult-Hello!”.
Britain stands on silver in Reggie-7 after the master class of Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Reggie-7 was brought to a standstill by Fiji's final team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely crushed 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master class of ball ownership, dispersion, game support, line running and rough power to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver — the third in Britain in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their way.
The painful beating of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal earlier on the same day, could come back to negatively affect them in the finals.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best team of 15 in this form.
This may be some consolation to the British — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow — chief coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was some journey for the British.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started out brilliantly, for fun, refusing to try to catch the ball by the British.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau dived into the corner.
With four minutes in his class, Jerry Tuwai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The spectacular attempt at Mitchell's capture kept Leon Nakarawa's man from killing the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremaloua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption, and there was still more than a minute in class... in the first half.
Watemo Rawovo then made his way through several other attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a score.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji was born to play Regbi-7, while Britain still mastered the trade.
Which is largely the case.
The United Kingdom has been making mass replacements for half the game, and they have purchased a Fiji Dam... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half of the game until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fiji interactions.
Dan Norton took a shot at the British, made the touchdown in the left corner to become 36-7, but the game was long gone on the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was not possible to admire Fiji’s approach with all its joy.
Mata William decorated the Fiji cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another last-second attempt.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semifinals, and the United Kingdom went a little over South Africa in a tense semifinal of one attempt each — the difference of British realization.
Kyle Brown pulled Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, broke the line and killed under the balconies in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, brother of the 15th party of England’s team, Anthony, won — and eventually the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the hump fight against cancer coach
There won't be any more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 hard lifts in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning have found their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were paddling the oars, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always as they pursued second in a row the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unbeatable performance, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that the two brilliant athletes, who slide through the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each golden paddle, a battalion of ready-made hands that contributed to the ever-increasing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a trainer who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing to do.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little bit of a change in your looks for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate to have been able to start treatment in early 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the schedule to a minimum, if that could be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the room — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said enough steps.
That's how it starts.
Snailing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next minute after the victory, their first thoughts were of William, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in trying to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with the service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I was an emotional failure this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
This couple set a tense pace that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, as New Zealand and Denmark’s teams approached, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been through a lot.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for the best way to go and get out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with a television adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took London about six months to realize that I had become the Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the date of destruction of food prohibited for importation into Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended on several occasions and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and milk products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country into the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016 alone, around 100 tonnes of prohibited products were withdrawn from sales.
I'm looking for a restraining order.
On Friday in Moscow, rains and thunderstorms are expected.
The capital region will pass through the atmospheric front, which will bring rainfall and lower air temperature.
During the day, the air will warm to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] of heat.
Thus, on a Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short rains, possible thunderstorms and wind surges up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with thunderstorms and winds up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also projected in Orlovska, Kursko and Voronezhska regions, reports "Dni.ru".
During the next working week, precipitation is unlikely.
The WTO Arbitration Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of accession to WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against the RF”, says a report on the organization’s official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systematic” or “comprehensible”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators soon.
This is mentioned in the report of the Russian Mineconomy Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia ' s actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is mentioned in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in resolving contentious issues in WTO undermined the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
Russia will therefore not turn to the WTO on the Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration has been replaced by a leader
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov Anton Vino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin moved to the presidential administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vajno stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work he had begun as head of the Ivanov administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Earlier, the “Investigation” was written that experts considered the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the transparent and understandable administration and the change in principle would not change anything in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head of the President ' s administration has been gone for a long time and has effectively built the AP ' s activities.
Instead, Anton Vaino, the deputy head of administration, came to know the specifics of the work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that, after a few years, the gas supply from the RF may become unattractive because of the re-orientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Mažec.
His words are given by the TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (at Gazprom), we will now diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, East, CNG and Norway will be the main routes of delivery for us," said Mažec.
Gazprom is currently dominant in gas deliveries to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had given it almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The proportion of Russian gas giants in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
It will be recalled that on 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture Gazproma and its European partners in the construction of the Northern Stream-2 pipeline.
At that time, Poland had previously submitted a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas on the North Stream-2.
This was stated by the Vice-President of the Holding Board, Alexander Medvedev.
The North Stream 2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is planned in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the Polish side's intention to give up long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Government.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased 42 per cent of the Russian Federation ' s gas supply.
In advance, Gazproma added that the very fact that a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not yet signify an end to the negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company applied to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
It is recalled that the Polish Government ' s Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, stated that his country could give up the supply of blue fuel from the east six years later.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
“North Stream 2” includes the construction of two seabeds of a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (MSM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first SMI in Ukraine.
“I can confirm that the RIA Novosti has increased the number of observers in this area”, he said, responding to a question from journalists.
According to OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and the Crimea is calm and security incidents are not recorded there.
Observers tracked three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video of a passenger plane called Jak-42 landing at Ufa Airport, which had climbed over the 400 m runway and landed on the left wing.
The video was published by the 360 channel.
It happened at 4:30 in Moscow time.
The flight of the Krasavia airline came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no victims.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates normally.
The VOLZA investigative office in the transport of the CDC has been investigating the cause of the tightening of the liner aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that it has happened undeniable.
Such statements were made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons being used in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where the Russian military helicopter was hit the previous day, the aircraft dropped the toxic bomb, but in Moscow it was called a drop.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the opposition group Harakat Nur Al-Din al-Zinki of what happened.
Soon it was known that the toxic gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, the burning of my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the eyewitness quoted it as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by the experts, action will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
Inadmissibility of use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that its areas are being bombarded daily and terrorists are obstructing the removal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian break” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered “not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffana de Mistura Humanitarian Affairs Adviser Jan Egellan said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to bring relief and evacuation to the city every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from the convoy trucks in a location where roads are practically destroyed and those left are mined,” said Mr. Egellann.
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue.
How Russia opened humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing struggle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August the establishment of a three - hour cessation regime that will be in place daily from Thursday.
The creation of humanitarian windows is intended to provide conditions for the delivery to the city of medicines, food and essentials.
The decision of the RF Ministry is based on the growing international pressure on Moscow, requiring the cessation of military operations and the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions in Thailand's resorts.
Immediately, several explosions erupted in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed as a result of the attacks, and 19.
The explosions centered on the town of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four-State citizens, and no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has rushed to claim that the Islamists are not involved.
Several persons are suspected to have been detained in the organization of the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the magnitude and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the leading military country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach, in the area of Phuket and the town of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, according to Colonel Crisan Patanacharoen.
To date, he added, but in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the countries “are convinced that they are not connected to international extremist groups”.
Too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patanacharoen. -
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are in fact local diversions, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day of the Queen of Thailand's birth, Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, and the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Sithich Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely at half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with tourists in restaurants.
It is well - known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The other victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and a Austrian national.
The Russians were not among the victims of the explosion, Rosturism reported to the press.
Local experts also associate the explosions with the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the constitution commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system whereby the upper chamber of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, there was a military coup in Thailand led by the commander of the army of the country of Prayut Chan-Ocha.
This step, he said, was driven by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and stretched out the protestors and the upper chamber of parliament.
How Bangkok Endangered
The Thai Government, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawatt, announced in January 2014 the establishment of a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime has been extended for 60 days.
Two explosions erupted in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the centre of Bangkok, the victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, had two explosions that had affected 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions caused unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and drew military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The dry log began to develop conditions.
As “U” has been known, the Government has been invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the dry log gold mine with two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed to prevent a company where 25 per cent and more belong to foreigners and those claimants whose capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the State.
The industry did not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players did not risk taking a difficult and expensive project.
The auctions may be announced in August and held in October.
Minerals have introduced a draft regulation and auction terms for the largest undeveloped gold mine deposit in Russia, Suha Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources of “U” familiar with the situation.
The project is scheduled for Wednesday evening, one of them is being clarified.
In the Mind Nature, they confirmed "U" that the project had been introduced into the Government.
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Cloponin, who was in charge of non-drug use, said "U", that the project had not yet been made available to the clerk's office.
“The auction may already be announced in August, as soon as the government orders are issued, and the tender may be held in October, given the time limit for the collection of potential participants (at least 45 days)” - they say.
According to “U”, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVAM in July (see “U”).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the claimants in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles mentioned in the draft, as already stated in “U” on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the RF or have dual nationality may not accept the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Dry Log refers to the feats of federal importance (stocks of over 50 tons of gold).
The Mind Nature confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on details before the Government ordered.
The auction participants' capital requirement was raised by the Irkutsk Region, said “U” in Minhroda in December 2015 and confirmed later the Governor of the Region, Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to Minhroda by his predecessor, Sergey Eroshchenko, “who had agreed on the projects with Rostech”.
Who lobbyed the restriction on the admission of aliens, the "U" interlocutors do not specify.
"But it is in the spirit of time: not to give control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor "U", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donska, stated on 1 August that foreigners could “go to the consortium” if the applicants attracted them “as financial structures, technological partners”.
"U" interlocutors find it unlikely that the Government will adjust the conditions.
The industry's main claimant for the Sulei Log is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO Paules, under the control of the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said and Rosteha.
As "U" wrote, in July, partners created the SP "SL Gold", where the "Police" 51% off, with the "Rostecha" RT-GR structure - 49%.
At Rostehe, the comments were rejected, the “U” stated in the “Police” that “of course, they are interested in this asset” and have all the necessary competence and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions”, added Paul.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the Russian Federation was made by sources "U".
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, claimed to be involved in the development of the Dry Logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to data "U", were not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold-Industrials of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, estimated the “U” investment in Suhay Log in $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants are intimidated not only by the level of investment but also by the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious exploration of stockpiles and complex ore working technologies, explains the “U” interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A deal - KIT Finance Pension Administrator - started the process of merging the four controlled NPFs.
As a result, the GasFund Retirement Stocks will create a NPF of approximately 373 billion roubles.
The launch of the merger procedure of the four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Heritage and Gazfond Retirement Stocks - was reported yesterday by the owner of the 100 per cent KIT Fund by KIT Finance Administrator.
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the CB in compliance with the requirement of non-impairment of the terms of existing contracts”, the company reported.
The merger is based on the Gazfond Retirement Stocks.
As Director-General Oleg Bialosicki points out, the pooling of funds allows for several tasks: expanding the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative deadline for completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gazfond Retirement Stocks will become the largest player in the SFOR market.
As at 31 March, the amount of pension savings of the pooling funds was more than 373 billion roubles.
According to reports on the fund site, the beneficiaries of the fund - KIT Finance Pension Administrator - are now Anatoly Gavrilenko (because the controlled PLO owns 65%) and the Gazfond NPF (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
For example, the subsidiary group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" early this year.
This joint NPF is now joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“The integration into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet the structural challenges”, says NPF Director-General Nikolai Sidorov, “Future”.
Active work on the consolidation of the funds has also been carried out since April in the Safmar pension group, the European NPF, Education and Science and the Safmar pension group, to be integrated into the Safmar NPF by the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the "Trust" NPF.
“The pooling of funds will result in increased risk control, operational processes and expenditure”, noted Safmar in the pension group.
A break in the pooling of funds supported by KIT Finance, the Pension Administrator, may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs had not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively deployed.
Following amendments to the CB Regulation in March of this year, a number of issuers conforming to the regulatory requirements are no longer subject to such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire edition can be bought by one major player," says the director of the ACCRA Financial Institute Ratings Group, Yuri Nogin.
Several top-15 NPF leaders on assets referred to the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, to the single fund, which the group owners had agreed on.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gabrielenko was not available for comments.
Gazfond also did not respond to request "U" in the NPF.
While consolidation of the funds is a labour-intensive and cost-effective event, it will be justified at a long distance.
According to the Director-General of Pension Partner, Sergei Okolesov, the Gazfond Retirement Stockpiling has fewer outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of other group funds.
In doing so, better experience will be required of the KIT Finance and Promagrofund NPF in the construction of retail SFORs, as well as the use of a more modern PO.
The requirements of the CB for NPF processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure in four funds in a single investment policy, according to the Managing Director of Corporate Ratings, Paul Mitrofanov.
“The effect of reducing the duplication of functions will clearly offset the possible costs of unification”, says Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of pooling four funds is estimated at 30-50 million rubles.
“The expenditure on the maintenance of four such funds is approximately 400 million roubles per year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually halving” - Mr. Okolesov is confident.
The best Disney cinema "Pete and his dragon" came out in the Russian tour.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the placid dragon, the soulful history and country-style songs are enough to restore belief in old-fashioned magic, according to ELENA KRAVCUN.
A frightened boy was selected by a dragon that became a human baby - sitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy in a fairy tale book, plays catch-up with him, and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he was abandoned and in a girdle, no longer to be distinguished from another imaginary forested sorbet, Mowgli.
In this way, Peeta discovers the red - haired female eger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband’s brother, is aggressively downgrading the forest.
Now she will have to believe not only in the existence of the dragon but also help save it.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of being a human being around idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, the moral code in their hearts, and smile more blindly than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible to be really hated or feared.
Even Gavin, who opened up a hunt for atypical forest dweller, is far from an unreparable villain.
The huge fluffy dragon has also become not scary, with a good bulldog’s face, a plane’s wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon roars, frowns, even whines, and, fortunately, doesn't say, but it's always trying to smooth it, making it usefully different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner are so high that at the most tense moments, they cry desperately in three hands not only by small viewers but also by adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Peeta, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually betrays a canon grandfather who would love to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowrey manage to take off a fantastically nice remake of a 1977 forgotten Disney film called Dragon Pie, which was mediocre from the nose to the tip of his tail and was only remembered for a mix of animation and a game movie, and make it the most emotional film of the summer?
No, it's not. It's not. It's a miracle.
In his painting, Lori took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Music numbers and most of the strange jokes are left behind.
This good story reads features borrowed from "Bambi", "Inoplanetian" and many other cute children's hearts.
Disney continues to successfully expand the 21st-century gallery of high-quality masterpieces.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as stunningly beautiful as The Jungle Book, and it doesn't have a master villain like Kate Blanchett as a stepmother in the new "Zulchka".
But this naive film is no less successful in helping us to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, directed by Lowry, will be re-enacted for the artistic cinematography of the Peter Pena story.
The "Pete and His Dragon" by the Tandem David Lowrey and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks have embarked on a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy named James Barry.
RBC journalist Aleksandro Sokolova is under new indictment
BBC journalist Alexander Sokolov's lawyers, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor's office had found fault with their case.
We learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a judicial meeting on the limitation of the knowledge of criminal cases, but the meeting did not take place as a result, and the investigators informed us of the prosecution's submission," explains counsel Olga Dinze.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the case and the materials collected were not in conformity with the qualifications of the case.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new indictment against Alexander Sokolov.
Either there would be another article of the Criminal Code (CC) or there would be the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze explained.
As reported by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the prosecution the wording for “dispersing the political situation towards instability” and “disposal of power illegally”.
Correspondent of Kommersantuboscosport, ALEXANDR ZILBERT, lived the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian assembly, ate lunch in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
Life doesn't seem to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last launches are sometimes completed in the middle of the night, after which athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction are ongoing, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, just arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the head of all the Olympic delegations will be dragged into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, as told by the head of the Olympic team, Igor Kazikov.
The one with the hot water problem, I'm sorry, with the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinicians came, but they were just splattering some stuff on the floor, and all of it.
They have fields, you see, they're innovative.
Mol, you can't wash them humanely.
We know these poles, the laminate is ordinary!
Anyway, we've got a change of venue, and now we're good.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, on the other side of the mountains, with impressive roars and water-filled areas.
Well, there's still a two-meter-long iron fence for reliability, along which the automatics are walking.
The village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, there is a huge Russian flag, which is completely devoted to the needs of our collective.
When you look at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems may be most urgent for the home team.
There are two announcements at the registration stand: "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "Prime in the gift of the badge.
The stand itself drowns in tracts.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the headings of the brochures: “Remembrance of infectious diseases for departing in Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, falling into respiratory tracts, loss of consciousness – stages of cardiovascular resuscitation”, “First aid in burnings, heat strokes, fractures and bleeding”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in the Russian community that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next door is the inspiring poster "No matter what, we'll win!"
And, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear them believe in them.
May the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia not retreat, not break!
And for a greater increase in the spirit is the announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
At the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirilla is provided with spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympic Assembly of Russia by the Protoyere Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeyev.
Order a request and other requests on the phone...
In fact, there is a meditation and religious ritual centre for all denominations in the village.
Well, the Russians have their own watch, in a privileged position.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to take the stairs recommended during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled upon the bodies upon her.
Apparently, they were the sleepers of the new clining company.
I think they're ready to throw themselves at innovative sexes at any time, and they've decided to set themselves a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a longtime acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, coach of our Batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He kindly agreed to show his rooms to the teacher, the champion of Europe, John Paul.
There's nothing to complain about, but it's uncritical.
Sunusel's one in four, but it's spacious.
The cabinet, of course, is funny, made of tissue, trust is not good, but things can be put down.
"No, you're pretending their tea's over." He's handcuffing a tennis player named Svetlan Kuznetsov, who I met in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it represents an area of 2.7 thousand square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 servings a day here for free.
The menu options are: "Best in Brazil", "Cooks of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta products".
The last option, as I've looked into it, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the giant restaurant units.
What kind of soup is Kuznetsov?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, welded.
And a teapot.
But just so you know, we've got worse food on the court.
There's something to choose from here, despite the unendurable uniformity.
I personally picked out a couple of cod and some fries in a tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the nutritional value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, to say the least, it was edible.
I don't even know why this line is always in the local McDonald's.
Satisfied, relaxed athletes are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're lured by a Victorian trap with a T - shirt.
It's provoked, you can tell!
To receive a gift, at least eight out of ten questions must be answered correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But that's not what she attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation has worsened on the second question: "If I have received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping checkpoint?"
I've stopped at option B, "No, I've got an hour."
I've lost my watchfulness, so to speak.
Forgot that the WADA is not to be expected to be weakened.
Anyway, we need to be there right away.
At the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
I thought, for some reason, if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I find it difficult!), I can use bio-addicts to get “additional nutrients to increase my productivity”.
Anne, no, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is that there is no categorical prohibition, but there is a strong refusal in several proposals.
It's not fair, it's WADA!
What's up, Russia?
Fall back behind Ephimov, Isinbaev, and our entire bloodless team.
That's why I've been focused, and I've won an unfortunate T-shirt out of the back of my head.
Know what they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I took to the gym next door.
He's got a trainer count on it.
He hit 250.
Surprisingly, no Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who doesn't know how to play practice!
There was this guy sitting in a clinic next door.
In line with the eye specialist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In a polyclinic, however, as throughout the village, no spat, a condom machine hangs.
There is a heartwarming appeal on it: "Stand up with a condom."
All that remains is the twisting of the iron, which resembles the handle of the door lock, and the condom made from the Amazon’s natural latex is ready to fall out of the machine.
I took it from myself, just to remember.
The athletes won't get away with it, they got 450,000.
It is precisely for a holiday and an empty time in the Olympic village that there is a whole entertainment centre.
It is surrounded by a board of acquaintances that reminds me that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some weird video trainer-like devices.
What's that? - I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian congregator who actively uses a wild toy.
I could just say, of course, that he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a compulsive Russia, that's all.
Here, by the way, there's a strange coincidence in the eyes of guys in yellow and blue.
The most playful congregator, turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village, looking at every corner of it.
But if you go instead of driving electric cars, you'll also have a Canadian house with a moose at the entrance and a recuperation tent, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a bench with goods of everyday consumption, and a post office with unique brands (only you can't wait for a turn from Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and a finder's office, and a photocopy.
And later in the evening, you will be sitting next to an olive tree hanging from a variety of colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left the world.
And you'll be under the accompaniment of a machine that sprays fluids in an orderly manner to kill insects, thinking of eternal.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was breathtakingly watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, the real sick people went online.
Little does anyone know that the news that Inna Deriglasov won gold in a rapier at the XXXI Olympics was the first to win.
Maybe I'm the only one who saw it happen, not counting the ones who watched the Carioca competition that night.
That can only be understood by a real patient.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors below, as they always do by nightfall, wake up and start screaming at each other with a loud voice.
And it's dangerous to move furniture.
There's no time in the kitchen to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule doesn't make any sense, so he just kept the Match, the First, and, just in case, Russia -- it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is a repeat home, the whole sport is in the record somewhere.
It's where the live TV shows broadcast.
Hope, of course, for the Match all night a young man screamed at the news shows first about the great Deriglasov semifinal, Shanaeva, then about the upcoming gold fight.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They've placed the freaks of their own greatness on the scene.
As a result, we have lost, but it is now said that the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with Di France is coming up, and the screen is unchangeable.
In an easy panic, I start writing channels.
That's what it feels like. It's the second time they've been around.
All right, let's go deep, get cables.
There's no fencing on any of the "Mate" themes.
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
I'm not comfortable with texting and tweeting some sports sites.
Boat surfing is an unexpected but brilliant result.
The “First” website provides a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this time.
I'm calling for fencing, I'm getting a gold match.
Deriglaza is a great counterattacker, moving forward on the points -- and it's clearly starting to take time.
The Italian woman is playing almost the whole part.
Our one-point front, just over two seconds.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglasov, but she retreats, time runs out, and the Italian woman stabs.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan has refused to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, DUM's Plenum committed his imams to preaching in Tatar only to make young Tatars learn their native language.
In the Office, it is said that this is “in no way a violation” of the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques Kazani says that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of the people, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar will not reach the entire audience.
Yesterday, the plenary of the Tatarstan DUM unanimously decided to hold Friday’s sermons in the republic’s mosques only in Tatar.
As Tatarstan's Mufti Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to learn their native language.
"For those who say "heavily", in each large mosque we intend to organize lessons in Tatar language absolutely free of charge," said Mr. Samigullin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques the sermon “should already be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that the Tatarstan DUM publishes the Shura magazine with typical sermons in Tatar.
Imam, who doesn't speak very well in Tatar, "can prepare for it thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DUM combines more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufti, Friday’s sermons in the districts are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Kazani had previously used Russian mostly in a number of mosques.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced at the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the management is tasking all students to speak both of the national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm can be said of the Nethar Muslims," Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not compulsory, the main part of the Mass".
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "U", that there was no serious threat of the removal of Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, he said that his sermons were not used in the republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Tatar Executive Committee of the World Congress (WCT).
Rinat Zakirov's head of general government said "U": "The mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language was removed from this area.
He noted that preaching only in Tatar language was “the desire of the imams themselves”, but in the absolute VCT they “consider it right”.
The "U" Imams who preached in Russian are ready to comply with the DUM decision, but it is believed that the residents will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
There are both Tatars and Russians in the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they'll be sad.
“We’ll have to change,” says I’ve got the Ferhat Mavletdinov Mosque.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer to even many Tatars because “Russian in schools and in kindergartens, on radio everywhere at first. ”
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language held on other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show you the way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
It's both Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
We have a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," says Imam.
He believes that in Tatar, sermons “will reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will be easier for me because the Tatar language is my native," Gabdul Galiullin concluded.
Former director of the FSIN has been tried
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office approved the indictment for the CSF investigation of the criminal case of the theft of budget funds allocated to the Russian Federation's FSI.
The ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles to the FSIN, will be brought to justice.
The D.A. sent a criminal case against former Director of the Russian Federation, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, and Director of the F.G.P.U.F.F.F.I.C.I.V.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged with the Moscow SDR of Art. 3, art. 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official authority resulting in severe consequences), art. 4, art. 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (the fraud committed by the use of its official position in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under article 222 of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CDC version, in 2010-2012, these persons were fraudulently kidnapped by the State Treasury of the budget allocated by the FIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budgetary money, the groups developed a scheme whereby the CITOS subsidiary under its control, with which the relevant public contracts were concluded, produced technical controls and oversight, including “electronic bracelets”, and implemented several times at prices.
Although CITOS had no production equipment, buildings, facilities for the installation of production facilities to create a complete cycle of electronic bracelets, five State-owned State-owned vehicles worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were closed between the CITOS and the Russian Federation.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were recovered from the accounts of the Samar branch of the GCC, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rbs of cash received personally from Mr. Reimer in his office from an accomplice whose criminal case had been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machinations, found an unknown source of ammunition in a prize gun, allowing him to make further accusations.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN filed a claim for damages in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.

Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas for national films only.
"I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, for which tickets cost 2-3 times less than for foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for the viewers with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 images in the country every year, from which 20 to 25 tapes reach the screens on average.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in which huge budgets are involved," said the film director.
On 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are creative teachers and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian backgrounds across Russia and from a number of countries of the neighbouring and remote world.

In Miassa, Chelyabin Region, lawyer of former Deputy Governor Nikolay Sandakova Konstantin Akulic is detained.
According to U-South Ural, another lawyer for the accused - Sergey Kolosovski, Konstantina Akulić was summoned today to the Miass CROMAC Investigation Division to charge with the annual statute of limitations on beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulic went to the scene as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
“It was deliberately initiated against unidentified persons, and now that he had begun to protect Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be Akulic,” says Sergey Kolosovski.
Konstantin Akulic became an ex-governance attorney in early August.

The Russian Honey Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RCM was engaged in the modernization of one of the country ' s oldest and ecologically “polluted” enterprises, the Karabasian Mede.
The Karabash medical facility was founded by an English stock company headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was a significant industrial enterprise for the country ' s economy, and it actually ensured the viability of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s production was halted due to financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabash Medical Union.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - the environmental one.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash had already been known sadly as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company had moved to the Russian Honey Company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabin Region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashad in the first numbers of July.
The head of South Ural called the dramatic changes that had taken place with the company since Karabashad turned into a group of RMBs.
The main activity in the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sero-silicate plant to capture up to 99.9 per cent of metallic gases.
According to the President of the Russian Honey Company, Vyvlordo Levin, the investment in the project amounted to approximately 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karabashad ZAO is the reconstruction of the conversion gear.
The replacement of three converters, impellers, gas pipelines is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new industrial waste treatment plant is planned to be launched at 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the city of Karabash will be increased.
For the entire duration of the Tominska Gok project, from the beginning of the construction and to the entry into service of the second line, the federal penalty will be 8.9 billion roubles.
After the introduction of the GOC into operation, tax revenues at all levels could amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million roubles are budgeted at different levels.
And that's the first year.
“The longer the business works, the more the contribution can be,” added Valery Ulanovski.
In the RCM, it was clarified that in 2015 taxes from the Miheev GoK were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of FMC enterprises in the lives and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
The RMIs help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and recreational facilities, and to improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Honey Company in Karabash was major repairs and, in fact, almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten by 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of the RMC Arena, there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and underground parking spaces for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
RMC Arena will be able to conduct spectacular professional international sporting activities.
But the main objective of the project is to make exercise and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The Sandholm refugee centre in Denmark suspected that its young people were involved in prostitution.
This is reported by The Local on Thursday, 11 August.
According to him, some teenagers told the agency staff that “someone in Copenhagen organizes prostitution.”
According to the publication, doubts arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told similar stories in Malma.
In 2015, a crisis broke out in the European Union due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them on its territory.

The man found cancer among others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local ocean.
Lobster weighs about a pound.
It is noted that Wayne Nickerson has been engaged in lobbying for the past 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in his career, the man was caught in a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue adornment as a result of genetic changes.

A five - foot - long [5 m] animal weighs about a ton.
The Black Sea Navy has carried out actions on submarine-diversion defence in the Black Sea.
RIA Novosti reported this to the Ministry of Defence Press Office of the Navy, Igor Digalo.
The training was carried out in the first phase of training on the special types of enforcement of the force of the IMF.
“Militaries of anti-diversion units engaged in anti-diversion defences at the base of the fleet forces on the coast and adjacent Black Sea marine area”, Dígalo explained.
Some 400 troops participated in the exercises, more than 10 military units, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, Graczonek anti-diversity boats and Raptor patrol boats.
During the manoeuvres of the forces of the armoured vessels using hydroacoustic means, conditional diversion groups were detected and the attack by the sea by the submarine divertors on the base of the CF forces was reflected.

Messengers and postal service owners must identify users and remove the prohibited information, such as the short text of the draft law drafted by the Media Communications Union (ICC), which brings together the largest Russian communications operators (the News).
The staff of the three Union-member companies confirmed that the project was under discussion.
At the beginning of autumn, he should be represented by a working group led by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, says the interlocutor “Knowledge” in the ICC.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the RF due to the break-in of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the break-in of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, President Barack Obama's administration will have to formally accuse Russia of attacking the Russian servers or the Russian hacker authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other US special forces are almost convinced of Russia's involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name the perpetrators of hacker attacks.
The exception is the one made in 2014 by the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those implementing or facilitating cyber attacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, writes the publication.
Even if officials found that the hackers had been supported by Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They need to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against the State whose hackers had hacked the Democratic Party's servers.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic correspondence from the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the distortion of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-monopoly trial was initiated at the initiative of the Jadexa.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the suspension of applications from other developers, in particular the Jadexa.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant market situation and imposed the installation of mobile devices on manufacturers along with the Google Play store of other applications.
Following the audit, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, followed by the head of the FAS, Alexei Dęcenko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the competition law should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to examine the solution first, and only then will it be determined with further action: to carry it out or to challenge it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service recognized the company as a breacher of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting trials.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of Ehu Moscow, the leading analyst, Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no effect on users or on the competitiveness of the corporation.

The "Anime" Snapchat effect is criticized as cartoons for Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say that it is racially touchless.
The Snapchat tool allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to create a painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are crude, distortive tools that create more than 30 million modified selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming commonplace.
Linza Snapchat was criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraging the bleached person as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics considered it a racist cartoon for Asians, "yellows".
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to the more serious problem of a diversity-related company.
On Wednesday, reports were spread and reported on The Verge and Motherboard on the day after Snapchat announced that it had been removed.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a tribute to the characters of anime, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the anime.
In an e-mail by Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photos were actively shared, she said that the lens was “insulting and at least embarrassing”.
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but highly destructive yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the virgins that we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- could mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lens creates an image offensive to the user, then said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Joe, "it's much harder to stay out of sight than it used to be."
On Thursday, Jo, the product manager and the engineer who works for the Medium, decided to delete her record in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for the Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
Jo criticized the white company's chief management, consisting of only men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jou, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "There were not enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, or have white people, but they do not have such positions as can be safely and openly expressed."
Other observers share her point of view, expressing their dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to a confidant, the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented sectors of the population and on active efforts to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Jo said that she would keep her record in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say they won't do it."
Military leadership has distorted ISIS intelligence, reports Congressional Commission
Officials from the Central Command of the United States Armed Forces have changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than on the ground, the congressional commission reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican Chairmen of the Board of Representatives for the Navy, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Sub-Committee, found “the widespread dissatisfaction” among Central Command Intelligence Analysts who claimed that the leaders had submitted their assessments of the American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command tended to give a more optimistic picture of US anti-terrorist actions than confirmed by actual data from the scene and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special forces,” said the news report.
“What was happening in Centcom is unacceptable: when our military is presented with unreliable analysis, our military is suffering,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a republican from California.
Problems with leadership in Centcom are reaching the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that have arisen continuously in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that Obama ' s administration had ordered the falsification of the reports, he claims that analysts felt that Centcom ' s leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events”, the report reported.
For example, Centcoma's official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation this is certain,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest management of the United States Central Command Intelligence Service forged command documents to mitigate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the Islamic State intelligence had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more extensive data will follow the Thursday report.
An additional, pending investigation into the Centcoms is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the United States House of Representatives published their own data Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Operational Group.
“From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments relating to ISIS and the Iraqi security forces,” states a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of the democratic party on the committee.
The procedure, according to Shifa, “stopped the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral status of analysts and “not sufficiently reflected divergent views”.
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to bring them into detention under "tasked or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by chief inspector of the Pentagon following complaints by Centcom's analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the investigation of the Chief Inspector was ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in their views in the interpretation of integrated data, and the Special Forces and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital subjects relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims).
But last year ' s statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence repeats the disputes that occurred more than ten years ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration had protested many analysts to support a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said that Hucker's team had found that despite public statements of the opposite, the Islamic State-owned oil-race aircraft did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil-race plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, according to the Times newspaper in September.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
The U.S. beats four consecutive times in female grass hockey, thus approaching a decisive confrontation with Britain
Once killed three goals in a match that ended in a victory over Japan with an account of 6-1, Katie Bam opened an account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. Women's Weed Hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bem, who is 27 years old, says that she is not sure if she would ever do something like this.
"I don't think so," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who follows their goals.
This is what she knows: the account of the Americans 4-0 in the Olympics, and they are competing first in their group with Britain, which remains undefeated after the defeat of Japan with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last round.
Both teams claim a quarter final, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will take second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the game of the quarter final begins.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, took a hockey ball for the first time when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't make the final round.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammate had a disagreement.
The following year, Coig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training,” said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity that we now have.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with a bumpy arm at short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long pass with a ball down to the left of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and abruptly sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the US goalie Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in a fight.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” said Parnham, “but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the impropriety of the Olympic Games, the Dan Jumps on the Bat
Wherever you are, no matter how long it takes, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be constant and inevitable, a fierce combination of competition and desire.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's this hot torch that goes from the archer to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talk in a row at the cafe, and not hear about Simone Bailes, Katie Ledecki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first to participate in the Olympics, the beauty of the cheeks, could well be among the celebrities shown in the primetime promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a feat.
But a 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic Battite Jumps.
The Olympic Fire does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: gunfire from a pneumatic gun, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us for his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to express my own personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the modest dazzling of the jumps on the trampoline.
Although the Battup jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are even part of the Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States had sent athletes to the competition, they had never won medals in the trampoline jumps, and their athletes had not gone to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male awards and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jumps on the whip have the charm of an outsider, especially because for an unenlightened ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit here, I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential — a cartoon of endless jumps — but also a quality of gymnastics and jumps into the water, two kinds of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "buttut" comes from the Spanish word "el tramppolín", meaning "tramplin for jumps into the water".
The winners jump on a giant baton, blowing up almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and flips) before final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity and “time of flight”, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes to the back and forth, to and fro in the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the view of the television cameras, the other annoying frontier: the world record or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and is sufficient to make even the viewer slip through.
But I think it's getting a little tired of watching Games.
He gives the jumps on the shoe a break.
The Batutist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, looks like an astronaut, flies up and down, then no effort up and down again.
And of course, they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program there is no crazy urge to finish, no leaps in length, just a strange, exquisite disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to the day.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast hourly in Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final of the day programme starting at 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, there is a calm, beautiful moment that can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to the usual views and objectivization — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested — Dooley is waiting for a new and enthusiastic crowd of fans.
“The Generation Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Fierce protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, extending to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have gone out to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were put to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep the country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially Somalia, and almost no country in Africa is receiving such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations have consistently referred to governmental repression — the opposition in the territory of the State has been cut off by the fact that the dissidents have actually been silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no alternative but to protest, a rebellion will rise,” said Seium Teshome, lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, beginning with land use, ending with the takeover of government coalition power.
Following widespread criticism of last year's elections, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and are now monitoring 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use unrest and re-arms.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, have now erupted.
First, it would seem perfectly harmless: smartphones.
Over the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara has flourished in politics and business from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together at the same time," said Mulat Gemec, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly recognized the first signs of dissatisfaction and used spies to obtain data and dispose of opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, a native of the Tigrai region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigrai.
Many fear that this will result in even more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia has experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people have protested that, as analysts have said, it appears, it was an election that the Government closed and then falsified.
During the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, although in less than the last few months, and the period of unrest was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it obviously did not stop the rise of domestic discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondara, the city of Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises and anti-Tigerian hatred on social networks is becoming comprehensive.
Analysts say that the protesters put the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it will be difficult to get through this tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to sweep up the last conflict involving his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the presidential candidate from the Republican party to address the American people wisely.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward situation, because they had to explain statements he probably did not mean.
After making this assumption at Wednesday evening's meeting, Trump strongly insisted on his statement Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded the ISIS.
But in a post on Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just an exaggerator.
This post was a direct contrast to the claim made just the day before when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease his speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the candidate for the presidency of the Republican party did not seize the opportunity.
The last scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against the backdrop of lower ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competitive speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Once again, after using Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and he said that his speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he drew on general criticism, almost saying that the Russian should break in Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, said, "Fine, I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is allowed in a political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing messages that respond to his worshipers to see how they work, and then to “explain” them in one way or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, the communication expert, who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he's saying and he knows that they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of easing speeches for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more violent tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump is giving up Clinton with a great deal of leverage in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is taking her to Florida.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous substitutes for Trump, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he is saying is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama ISIS was almost unknown to a tiny organization, he called it an unimaginable threat, totally unfair, and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IGILU to develop, as it has failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for all his words and prejudice against him.
He made fun of the "poor poor" TV experts who tried to figure it out and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have mocked Trump's excuses as an overriding testimony that he is not fit for presidents.
Once the coffee's out, it's back in Greenpoint.
Werb's coffee shop was sauerkraut, which only received cash in Williamsberg, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sheri, who took the place of Werb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of biscuits.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in an up - to - date city.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Werb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is being updated in turn.
The reborn Werb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and they accept credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffeemaker who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to put him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, aged 36, left much behind.
Werb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has mirrors from the old Verbe.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
There are bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches in the menu and toppings of capers or onions are available.
There's a brown rice dish.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but they're making fresh juice.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had called attention to the steady flow of old permanent customers.
"Many former clients were also awarded prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Olivera was one of such clients.
Olivera, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she's having coffee again, although she ordered a cup of tea that day instead of a regular ice-coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another former client, visited Verbe loyally since 2003.
He walked in before work and ordered the same thing over and over again.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as of the hour, I came, and for me they made my bagel with oil and all the dishes," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but sometimes he changes something by using bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the dishes.
Rodríguez said he wasn't offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make special soap for Werba using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the cafe.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window so that his new neighbors would feel desired.
There are other benefits to a new place.
The local juice point plans to pour on bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a chance that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, the new Verb will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular, and he said he was killed with grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whit said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long did I want to feel this smell," he admitted.
Depressive food for depression in the Flesh Table
In March 1933, shortly after taking office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt settled in the Oval Office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable dishes on Fifth Avenue, such as fua-gra and Maryland Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and blackberry pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Wives living in Brooklyn Heights are food history specialists.
The last book, "Raga in Chinese", was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new joint work, "Seal Table", which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some way, in their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny snack shop in Flateyron district, which has been operating since 1929, the Stock Exchange crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, a mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for discussion of food in the Depression era.
“The roulettes were very demanding, ” said Siegelman.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roulette, a bean roll.
They were made of basic ingredients and cheap products that allowed for the expansion of ingredients.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Ko's gone.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years leading up to the depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The Tablet Table describes how the country dealt with the sudden end of being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Koe, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
The same was true of the new budget ration: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and toasters, have become the main food; the pastry is “a wonderful way to finish meals, ” observed Siegelman, because the cook could hide the unappetizing ingredients under the thick layer of the sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
For many years, meat, a former basis for American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
When studying for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared an epoch of baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table has not been successful," Ko said.
Zigelman added, "That was very strange."
Peanut oil is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical of many home-cooked recipes.
More than ever before and ever since then, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept the challenge, and to transform the barrel of like fried spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The Tablet is a celebration of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Guver in the spirit of "let go of pies".
While publicly carrying the simple farmer’s anguish of Iowa’s childhood, he was feeding as a meager millionaire who had become one.
“ He liked continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce, ” said Ko.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example for his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninteresting in taste, and this led to the White House "using not only the most worn-out food in Washington but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared".
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
Wives tell us that when they wrote the book, they had a better understanding of Mother Siegelman’s eating habits — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," Ko said.
Siegelman remembers, "She poisoned people in full seriousness."
There's been an unpleasant incident with the profiteers.
When the plates in Eisenberg's left, they and Coe got dessert, which they made at home: a blackberry dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called blackberry muss,” said Siegelman, adding that it was a popular reception to give modest recipes brosque names.
There were no whipped creams, only ink, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Ko asked twice for supplements.
With the voice of a certain budget maker, he said to his wife, "A few rubles of Greek nuts wouldn't be a problem here."
The arrest of the figures of the massacre at the Khwan Cemetery was extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Court of Justice had placed a mass-drawling case in the Khwan Cemetery under arrest.
In the case of accused persons, 14 persons are involved.
It is recalled that on 14 May, several hundred Central Asian and North Caucasus civilians fought in the Khwan Cemetery, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the Public Organization, Alexander Bocharnikov, was charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Olga Holodec during a visit to the Bryan region.
We have specific parameters for how much more pensions are needed to offset the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now failing the half-hour, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks," says Golodec Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed strategic development centre chapter by Alexei Kudrin, a six-year-old pension scheme, the Deputy Prime Minister reported that the topic was not being addressed in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigorian went to the finals of the small-calibre shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Cyril Grigorian went to the finals of the small-calibre shooting competition in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place -- a new Olympic record in qualifications.
Cyril Grigorian became second, 628.9 was.
In all, eight of the best athletes went to the finals.
Kamensky is a world record player in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempted coup d’état,” reports the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that “if any part of the charges is confirmed, I will return to Turkey”.
However, Gulen denied any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Gulen in absentia.
It will be recalled that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse legal services during the dispute over hepatitis C patent with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the gravity of the Hepatitis C patent with the Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for violating Merck's two patents related to the medicines of Gilead, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, the U.S. federal court judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred during the lawsuit.
Merck tries to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
It happened in 2013, when Gilead and Merck tried each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which is the basis of the sofosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
The United States-supported armed forces claim to have taken full control of Manbage from the Islamic State
The United States-supported armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbage near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who have been hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were detained by the militants, told Reiter Sarfan Darvis of the Allied military council of Manbija.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are doing clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton published her tax declarations for 2015 on Friday, which showed that the presidential candidate from the democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in voluntary contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in honors for the presentations, and the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia and his wife, Anna Holton, published tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency,” said Clinton's pre-election adviser, Jennifer Palmieri, in a statement.
In total contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is a common case for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service verification as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax declarations.
“Your move,” tweeted Clinton Jan Sems, adviser to the pre-election headquarters, referring to a declaration by a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the tests were completed.
Critics of Trump, including a presidential candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of the issue and released an online video Friday that focused on the outstanding republicans who convinced Trump to release the tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a talk on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception for ten years: publish their tax declarations,” she told the assembly.
Polico reported that Trump did not pay any or almost no taxes for the two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times business observer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that this might still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named after the billionaire, investor Warren Baffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Baffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, he invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was not afraid of tax collection agencies, but of voters.
Clinton pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index ration fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chilean powder condoms and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
In Tanzania, environmentalists use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from falling into human settlements by throwing condoms filled with Chile’s powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, together with the American Committee on Nature Protection, took on its promotion, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Before, many used copies to protect themselves.
Friday will be the World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
“Since we have invented a set of tools ..., we have seen changes in relations within these communities, which makes them more confident that they will not be able to release elephants into their fields without harming the elephants,” said Executive Director Honeyguide Damien Bell.
The first two steps are to set the torch on fire before the broken elephant and signal the horn.
If he can't be intimidated, they're throwing away the so-called Chilean cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with the boy in a condom, and the end of the powder is twisted, and only the fuse is left outside.
When the condom is lit, it melts with the peat, spraying the tiny powder of chili in the air.
One blow is usually enough to deploy the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a launching device that shoots the Roman candles into the air by causing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have still not returned to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July.
Such data were provided by Head Mevlut Chavusoglu of Turkey in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we have withdrawn 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 persons did not return without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy agency.
It will be recalled that in July Turkey had attempted a coup d'état.
The authorities officially stated that the coup had failed and reported the detention of more than 6,000 persons, including military officials of the upper and middle levels.
The coup attempt resulted in 290 deaths, according to Turkey ' s MlD.
The Jewish director sharply criticised the Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli telephone code at the request of the Arabs, reporting on RT News
The French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli telephone code on its list, with employees referring to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lantzman, author of a documentary on the Holocaust "The Shaw", expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States where it could be called directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
He wrote Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In order to find an explanation, the director raised the question at the headquarters of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, was "shocked."
Klerk Hotel said that the measure was “a deliberate decision by the manager of the Kempinski Hotel Network.”
The reason behind this step caused even more anger from the director.
“Most of our guests were Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed,” he said, according to Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a terrible disgrace, ” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and this particular network of hotels is an even greater disgrace.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel simply went to the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“We would be ashamed,” said another post, which indicated that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any charges, calling what had happened "unsupervised" and "excusing" Lanceman, reports Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list,” said a representative of the Kempinski Hotel newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest government reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing on the walls of graffiti against the acting President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesting masses went out to support the expelled President, Dilma Rusef, when the Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to the RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagarian of Russia in Iran.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagarian said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has joined the top-20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with confidence that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jedd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist its legs in the defence and industrial complex.
The reasons for the dismissal were the “systematic failure” of the Director-General of the Diamond-Antey concert, “losses in work” and “loss of confidence”.
Gennady Benderski has been appointed Head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Nebrodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the context of the army’s extensive rearming?
It is likely that the RF leadership does not wish to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that there are many problems in the defence and industrial complex (OPC) and the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Nebrijedov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
Almaz NGO is the main company of the company, which specializes in the production of air defence and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Poliment Redut and Morpheus ZRCs, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, esmines and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal, Dmitry Kornev, believes that the dismissal of Nechrodov is due to a breakdown of the deadlines for these projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and was expected to be implemented in 2013.
Poliment-Redut should become the main PPE system on the newest vessels of the IMF.
According to the information I receive, in a few years no real successful test has been carried out.
It's true, as far as I can tell, that there's no definite fault of Diamonds,' said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay in entry into service may also occur with the P-500 ZRC.
The design and design of the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should join the troops.
In the Ministry of Defence, it is assured that “work is being done on schedule and will be completed within the prescribed time frame”, although in 2014 the department recognized the development problems of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Necrodov, who has been managing the Diamond since 2011.
Cornev noted that the disruption of project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the OPCC and business management plans.
The industry has long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
As a rule, the Directors of Defence Companies leave their posts at their own request, under a contract of agreement between the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although there was no resonance.
This suggests that the leader of the Diamond was perhaps a figure of tolerance and resisted the downfall of the discharges.
It appears that such conduct is no longer intended for the State to tolerate.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence installations and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the RF is seeking to punish the leaky managers (Star Shipyards).
The President has paid particular attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrial Commission and meets periodically on the re-arms.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the managers of the OPCC in an effort to have the loyal composition of the directors under its control, who will comply with the orders received above.
This is far from ideal policy, but in the background of corruption and the absence of normal competition in the OPCC, other instruments are not available to the State.
The situation in defense is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in OPCC, the RF leadership is taking full steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The military personnel have acquired new quality with the appointment of Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu.
It seems the President has taken over the famous saying, "You want peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which had established the Moscow spheres of influence on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world, ” perhaps there is no calm corner left.
Despite the common disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia on an equal footing.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and move to new frontiers of world policy.
Scotsman Kallum Skinner moves on the finish line, leading the British to take over the bicycle gold
Scotsman Kallum Skinner raced to the triumph of a men's sprint at a fair in Rio last night, resulting in the British command trio defending its title from London in 2012.
Glasgo's 23-year-old male was the strongest man his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by running down the finish line to win the New Zealand favorite team.
Britain declared its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after completing modestly the sixth world race in London, despite Hoi's career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist in Jamie Staff.
They did just that when Hinds appeared.
Hoya's withdrawal also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now being realized.
Hindez, Kenny, champions of Hoi four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifications, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed it up.
The change of strategy was a large part of the transformation, where Hindez drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi observed from his seat as an invited expert of the BBC and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the pedestal.
A 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is an easy comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez deliberately fell on track after a failed start.
He later gave up the comment and there was no way to appeal to British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the stands."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We played so many races with the world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which won seven of the 10 race names in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the fairies will have five more successful days.
With the form that Kenny showed, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine him repeating Hoi's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow you to see Kenny — who was 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (it seems that the sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) — account for six gold medals and one silver medals.
That would be just like Hoya's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hendez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to win the knighthood."
It was the only one in a day to play medals, but there was some good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dooll are qualified for the fastest four-mile team race of four.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be exactly the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, prior to the qualification meeting, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngawa improved the world record by showing 4:13.260.
The UK Command came up with a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the mid-term Olympic Games and earn a ton of medals.
After an exceptional demonstration of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last one, leaving the position of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and harassment, and leaving large figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
On the basis of the race for the first evening at the fair, however, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain in achieving the summits at the right time may well be repeated again.
The future of the Portland Steel Plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant is said to be the owner of the plant is about to terminate the supply contract: all supply contracts are planned to be cut off.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant expires in November for 20 years.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down the metalworks at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Portland metal industry of Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions have been the result of reflection on the future of the plant for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the factory.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrób Valley, reported that it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the Alcoa and Aluminum joint venture, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not cease”, she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called “Hedged Contracts”, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of avoidance, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring its share of revenue in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since the financial year 2018 is currently limited to projections of a strong future market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of “future avoidance”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a steel plant or to supply electricity to a steel plant”.
The American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Steel Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, it will be bad for the manufacturer," he said.
It's not just the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Genner Maternal Manager Chris, appeared on the upcoming September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has been defiling fashion for weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“ When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and wept, ” wrote Kendall.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian Family?) video-reality, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshers Rob and Kathleen, also joined by the world's most beloved uncle show business, producer of the Cardassian Family Ryan Sicrest), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover, and in the end the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline of almost all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sicrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the multi-hunted bunny program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed that fame to get to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we certainly entered the new era of the Kardashians show.
Have the older sister Kendall Kim take the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of Vogue per year.
Its thickness is more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, and it attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of who will be on his cover from the stars is expected with such anticipation that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine were merged to an official anon.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly presented more “memories that work with models” than “models that are celebrities”.
The Oscar Prize winner and Dior Jennifer Lawrence's brand face were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage's honor was brought to light.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "extreme model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year’s cover, this year was one of the most successful careers in connection with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy for Jenner's success.
Jenner's situation in the fashion world, given her past TV reality show star, was always supposed to be slim.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment".
These sentiments rekindled after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, are selling you their photos in her own apps that are available on a paid subscription.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter herself to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further reduce funding for and activities already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to combat unjust deprivation of property and so on — have already been denied free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Centres, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision wasn't overturned, the situation would only get worse.
“The Queensland Public Legal Centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services they need”, he said.
People who break out of violent relations, people with unruly and destructive debts, families who go through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers — all of whom have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and to the Government of Palaszczuk to engage in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was tried: it is alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after the report that his operations director in North Carolina threatened a staff member with a gun when they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
Director Earl Phillip “extracted a gun, placed his right index finger on the chicken and sent a gun to Vincent’s kneecap, ” Bordini claims in a complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four others had become involved in similar incidents with Phillip, he was alleged to have made a complaint.
“Guns don’t have to shoot to hurt,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place only two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican party made a furore, he told the listeners in North Carolina that the “people of the Second Amendment” — understood as gun owners and their lovers — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
Trump's pre-election headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the pre-election headquarters for negligence and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, abuse and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks made a statement in response to the request.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Presidential candidate from the Republican party Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, McLenburg High Court (Charlotte).
Britain must move the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general throughout London but also throughout the country.
As far as I am concerned, this was precisely the great advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought great benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do that again, creating opportunities for locals and firms near Heathrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new interns, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too extensive.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving behind the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has introduced £11 billion of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 — the best terminal at the airport five years in a row, to T2 — built in the middle of the two world's busiest runways.
They are now ready to secure the third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a huge success for Britain, and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be too.
The time has come for us to direct the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Heathrow, to ensure our trade future and to create an inheritance of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "Battle Cats" on advertising blocking
For companies that earn money on the Internet, trying to bypass advertising software is a game in mouse cats, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post that users could update their filters on the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site changed the series around its advertisement to make it more difficult for advertisers to recognize which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he could have bypassed the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock representative Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of advertising blocking” and that Facebook may present its own decision soon.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered the fight is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers have become a major problem for industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of people using this software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is looking for advertisers on the desktop because mobile advertisers are not effective in Facebook mobile applications for social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But advertising in the desktop version is a lucrative enough article to make Facebook consider such a step a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how advertising targets them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were a source of concern, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rude tool, so instead we have focused on creating instruments like Advantages to transfer governance to people.
A woman was moved to a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was lying on a highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman has moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
An incident occurred on the A1 near the Morge in the canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay on the road in the darkness of “in the gesture of despair” and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died instantly.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, police have reported that they have been called upon to respond and others who have witnessed the incident.
A criminal case had been initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, said Zile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of whom are involved in a person walking in the dark on a highway — it has been condemned that roadists cannot expect a random encounter with a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing the death of recklessly after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Payerne at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, listened to the court.
The Court found that a female police officer, who responded to an emergency challenge, managed the vehicle in a way that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Someone with information about the incident on Thursday near the Morge should call the police for 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the NASA Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for research in the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere overcrowded with carbon dioxide, could ever have conditions similar to those of the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus’s small speed of rotation was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus may have had a diluted atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and it may still have been turning slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thick.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus sets its daily side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained journalist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows Venus' history, similar to that previously assumed by planet scientists.
Although Venus may have been inhabited for several billion years, she has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew away, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey process on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
The executive vice president/main manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice-president of hockey activities, Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the Vice-President of hockey activities must match the vision of the organization perfectly.
It should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach in his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was smashed by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and played the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points left Wild in the fight for the second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
The keeper of the Hall of Fame, Roy won four cups Stanley — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Northern Sea oil companies resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Working strikes on oil wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate have begun a new round of negotiations, the lead representatives of the parties reported.
The attacks against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Water Group and the Unions of Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes,” says a joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to market tensions.
The company's lower rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract staff serving on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give it the space needed to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and has announced plans to cease oil-gas activities in countries up to 10 because it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-saltness with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower oil prices: the economic situation has worsened as a result of the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
Scottish Parliamentary Member Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some”, he said.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades Spear
Kepler's last mission to the Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of the speeds of the stars in the Pleiades.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other star formations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Ribal, a researcher at the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades are 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the colony are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're turning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars cast large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds hold the brakes on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star’s rotation by monitoring the time between known star spots, such as solar spots.
The new speed catalog suggests that more massive stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
Fishing compares the stars to the dancers: the larger ones make the pyroetes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'Pleiades' ballet, we see that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who turn faster are usually very light stars," said Rybal.
Since the Pleiades are so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars to the speed of rotation.
“The star formation of the Playa provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older,” said Ribal.
We want to know a lot more about how, where and why stars slow down their speed and hang their dancing shoes on their nails, as it were.
Rybal and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation rate of the Playads in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation involving the activities of a group of Ukrainian diversors detained in Crimea is conducted by two departments, reports Kommersanta.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions to Crimea.
As previously reported, a citizen of the Ukrainian city, Energodar Evgeny Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan Hemisphere in Armenia, the oil base in Theodosia, the Kerchen Parom Transport, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields as a diversion site.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all vendors have been detained.
This, in particular, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Simferopol Paradise, notes the publication.
The main coach of Russia's football team was Stanislav Cerchesov
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the main coach of the Russian football team, Stanislav Cerchesov.
The contract will be calculated for two years until the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RUF appointed Stanislav Cerchesov as the main coach of the Russian football team.
He is a well-known football player who played in Moscow's Spartacus as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with strong experience who was the mentor of Russian teams such as Spartacus, Gemchozina Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, and Warsaw's Legion, who won the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cerchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will be for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his training headquarters will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the entire training headquarters will pay Euro2.6 billion per year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership has set up a goal for Stanislav Cerchesov to bring Russia's compendium to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give football players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he was glad that his choice fell on him.
The first match, led by Churches' Assembly of Russia, will be held in Antalya on 31 August, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
As a reminder, Leonid Slutsky, the former head coach of the Russian football team, combined him with coaching at the CSCA club.
He declared his resignation following the failure of the Russian national team in Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor outcome of the composite.
Namibia, which was trapped between Angola and South Africa, suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has made great strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries see basic free primary and secondary education as their own, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees for “reimbursement of costs”.
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has become free since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Despite the international trend in inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
As compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Transparency International Perception Index, which consists of human rights defenders.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional assessment methods, remain sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS -- almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with income above the average, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some difficulties that are inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
There are isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes in the desert, which must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the outskirts of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is a challenge for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
Namibia, however, did not intend to give up, and the country was solving its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in creating a diversified economy and a united society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of health-care visitors in northern Namibia are Angolan nationals.
No one in Namibia speaks of building a wall that separates the country from the poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours but therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate in sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia ' s natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country ' s resources and to review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of speech is so important.
As The Hague Head of State said, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, says the President.
Not all key resources in Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can embark on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the greatest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, in the excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts, more than 3,000 total weights, were found.
Only one burial known as “Mogile No. 43” resulted in 990 gold items weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s ancient gold can soon be changed to the unseemly kind of bus, found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as the Tell Junati.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Junati is located far from the sea, near the village of Junati Pazardzhik district.
The busina is a gold band that has been turned into a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, head of excavations at Telle Junata, dated 4600 B.C.E. and stated that she was at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 to 4200 BC.
There is currently no technology that allows the metal to be dated with impeccable accuracy.
How can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that the gold of the Junachi is older than the gold of Varna."
This is a finding of critical importance: it is a tiny object, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajiev, scientists will soon review the composition of the metal and will re-examine and study more closely the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The site also explains a lot.
Tell Junati is a village famous, even if you have never heard of it.
At present, Tell Junaci is considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium before our Common Era.
In the years to come, metal processing has developed rapidly in the region, ranging from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpath Metalurgical Province.
In the five millenniums leading up to our Common Era, settlements of the urban type began to develop around the centers of metalworking.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
Of them, Tell Junati may be the most ancient, since the artifacts of the 4900 years before our Common Era were found here.
I'd call Tell Junacci a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This is the place of Schumer for a thousand years,” says Boyajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia — modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in a common understanding of the word.
The excavations of Tella Unaci have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have unearthed nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remnants of a fortress wall that had once reached three feet [3 m] in height were found.
Few have been preserved from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban construction, business centre and residential landscapes.
The Telle Junati is often called the Bird City: dozens of clay bird figures were found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of peace, hence the assumption that they were not ornamental objects, but the object of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indo-European tribes that came from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
They were not stopped by the three-meter fortresses.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a violent battle: the remains of old men, women, and children with wounds caused by cannons were found inside the houses.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the familiarity of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about separate cultures but about the “lost” first European civilization born in the Balkans.
The “Gold Varna” found relatively recently in 1972 was a powerful incentive in the search for this civilization.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury was supposed to precede something like a tiny gold bus built in the Telle Junata.
The Porsche has artificially aging the 911 Targa model
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
Retro-Lock is, for example, in the special color of the body of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the fair received a firm white chart along the boards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some details of the body design decorated with “white-gold metals”.
In the interior of retro-prints, it is noticeably smaller: it is largely a grey-blue gamma-forming, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical regulation and separate black and anodized steel thresholds with unit logos.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift of a car-chain and a richly distributed album with photographs of the production process.
The power plant of Porsche Exclusive professionals did not move: retro-market characteristics are quite consistent with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 litres, a developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released by limited printing, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular athlete are reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have unleashed an arms race
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented advertising from being hidden on social media pages has provoked decision makers to block advertising for responses.
The AdBlock Plus released the antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The Social Council noted that, in an effort to deceive new unblocked advertising technology, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial advertisements, also blocks many common positions from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they expressed regret for such an AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source of TechCrunch's social network developers, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the Social Council and the Blockers have unleashed a kind of “arm race” in an effort to play each other, and the affected party has become users who have missed interesting recordings from friends or who have seen advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blockage of advertising have recently been fuelled by heated disputes.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to justice by the Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Russian Federation Committee of Inquiry on the Murmansk Region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual assault.
As a result, at the end of November 2015 the accused in the Pavlov street in Murmansk committed sexual acts involving violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The penalty provided for in that article provides for the maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Crosswen Fengguang 370 to Russia and Rich New - driving website www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China's popular car class, combining the values of minivan and crossover.
Another declared Russian premiere is the pick-up of Rich New.
Many Western firms in the Moscow International Motor Show decided to ignore this year, so Chinese firms will fill the void of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor will be a powerful front, with large views on the Russian market and with the intention of offering our auto-lovers a number of interesting innovations in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China this spring at the price of 55,900 Yuan (sometimes less than 550 thousand roubles at the current rate).
It is unlikely that such a price tag will shine to the Russians and that the issue of delivery to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to get to 11th place in the list of the most sold minivans, although due to high road lighting (175 mm) and protective plastics on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be counted as crossovers.
Crosswain is built on the front-end platform of the Fengguang 360 junior model, with the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen “like Tesla” on the central console was displayed only on early exhibition copies of the crosswood, and cars with “music” were sold easier.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed of a flat loading area of 1,650 mm long, with a maximum luggage capacity of 1500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine consists of only one - 1.5 litre gas "atmospheric" of 115 l.c. combined with a 5-stage mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a cost-saving budget for the owner of the appetizer at 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New truck is well-known to the Russians of Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with slightly decorated Chinese stylists design.
Despite the morally outdated design, the model still enjoys stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwelcome “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will probably be interested in the Russians, as modern - day Japanese pickups have become overpriced.
Rich New is equipped with two choice engines: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.s.) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 l.s.).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and a rigid "frontal".
He will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new Flagman Sedan A9, his Russian Prime Minister's mission of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Mine-like crosswords on the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Dongfeng Russian ambulance consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatzbek.
During the seven months of this year, the Chinese firm ' s dealers had 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the procedure for sending property tax notices.
All Russian motorists have become accustomed to the unchanged scheme in the summer and fall: they receive the payment of a transport tax in the previous year by mail.
This year, however, many of them will not wait.
It is a matter of the fact that the tax inspection has changed the way citizens are notified without too much noise.
Those registered in the Taxpayer's Personal Office on the official website of the task agency.ru will receive notices electronically.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard “paper” message.
The innovation affects all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive the usual letters.
After all, there is an opportunity for the record holders to return to the old scheme on the site.
To that end, they would have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" as soon as it is completed, while the letter will go for a few days and may disappear altogether.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspection service exceeded 18 million, allowing the department to be seriously saved on mail.
On the other hand, modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changing order.
Some may have registered in a “personal office” to obtain a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not be expected to receive mail notices and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the personal office of the taxpayer shall be made in three ways: through the records of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally from any tax inspection office (independent from the place of entry).
It is recalled that this year the transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
The notification began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, where the refinements are aimed at achieving a very high impact, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse G-Power's masters, who began to modify Mercedes-AMG G 63.
The G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign to it.
Really, why not improve the G 63-571-powerful flying machine with tank aerodynamics and aerodynamics up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Infused with the shells of a mad Gelic, the master took advantage of the 5.5-litre supersonic eight.
And here's the motion of the race to the hundred has improved to an indistinguishable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying fiddle is capable of pulling in 5.3 seconds.
After all, the acceleration at an average speed is probably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 does not travel 210 km/h faster, the Tuning Allway with a deactivated electronic belt can reach 250 km/h.
Outside the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory original, except for other wheeled discs - 23 inch Hurricane RR of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury unit has an amazing 6m-long conceptual cluster, which will be presented in the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i green subbrand and will move its electrical models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four environmental innovations are expected.
