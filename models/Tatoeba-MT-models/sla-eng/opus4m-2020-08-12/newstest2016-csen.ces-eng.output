On the emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During the emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset, and that contact with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," was in a letter signed by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot his favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school forced the students and the faculty to hide behind the locked door, entrusted authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by the state investigators and students and employees who knew him together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other members of the Faculty and many students attended courses at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclinations regarding problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agile and shaken up, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for health leave when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was probably in trouble."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After leaving campus, the police picked up his trail as he crossed the state line of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with the only gun in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car running on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went into this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb's 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who taught her guitar playing for years.
He was a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all girls is gone as soon as it appears," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house, adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She was my mother's best friend.
O’Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail graduated from the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and casual entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a slowly lit bar near Gautier, said he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and accordion for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We lied and recorded each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy's student club and student government.
In Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, took part in commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the viguilia during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually built.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, a decline compared to the 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit employees in October until December.
While vacations in themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily receive employees for assistance in trade and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts, and I realize that I'm within the reach of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a document on "Back to the Future," which lists interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's truly the best travel document I've ever seen."
"Back in time" will be available on the water, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the UN once again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations on a political solution.
Ban said at a central press conference that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation insurmountable."
The Ban has called on five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity, which they have demonstrated in reaching an Iranian nuclear agreement on the resolution of the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others above the wave hand as over the unbeknownst joke.
And some prepare for implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it (for now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are seriously starting to ask what that means for the nomination of this property magnet.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, and not one of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and start unloading their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow it.
Here are some recent voting numbers indicating that the real estate magnet is not only a fleeting phase:
Trump's benefit rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick in the initial stages.
After a vote at Quinnipiac University last week, it was found that 60 percent of the republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the republicans said that they would either be "exciting" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they'd be "enraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush's favourite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his indignation and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are inclined to the idea that the real estate magnet has the right temperament for being president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post vote Monday.
The same number is held in the senatorial club of Iowa, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of the Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temper does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who will most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the previous cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% bid for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the shattered field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diphtheria spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct match between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always the majority support.
Leads over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christi by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would run a big 19-point dealer in a hypothetical one-on-one game.
The naked majority of Donald Trump's followers claim they've already made their point.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump’s voters claim that they will no longer change their minds.
Clearly, many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door for a change between candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in the announcement of his campaign, immigration has still been the main and central topic of the conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's insensitivity lures key Spanish voters away from the Republican side and damages efforts to rebrand.
But according to a new public opinion poll Monday, ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the immigration theme remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will also remain.
Frustration from the government is reaching new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive roughly half of the support from the Republican voters, especially due to their state of the outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post vote say they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent were "infernally angry."
The House has supported a greater proportion of the State's coal charges.
The Czech Republic will get more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Parliament supported the government amendment of the Upper Law, which regulates the level of remuneration from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them extra money for both the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal has been criticised by opposition members who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as yet, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.The parliament, at first reading, supported the government's amendment of the Upper Law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive more of the charges from the surface coal mining of the mining company.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the proportion of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that companies earn.
The change in the fees for mining is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million into the state treasury in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, about 450 million crowns and 150 million crowns were charged to the municipalities.
Approximately 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns went from the mining of brown coal.
The novelty is also calculated by increasing the remuneration from the mining areas with the permitted mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments is to continue to be wholly owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million annually instead.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government's regulation.
Remuneration shall be calculated as the result of the amount of growth generated and the rates for each type of growth.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting a fee by government regulation does not have to be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging the undergrowth which is a state property.
The fees shall be paid only by the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the village's money and a quarter of the state will be received.
The same ratio will be applied in the case of mining of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that will be taken from the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide the Bank’s rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that it would harm the communities affected by mining and by the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have done so, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Ovvit) elected in the Ustak region.
Prior to the rise in unemployment in Mosteck, KSČM Member Hana Aulicka warned.
Kadner and Aulick had failed to propose an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for work.
According to the mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent agreed on over the long term.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should therefore not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government accepts.
However, it considers that the increase in employment charges is profitable.
According to the rapporteur for the Milan Urban Amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal goes beyond the limits, it will have an impact on income for both the state and the village, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the lower Czechoslovakian army should not fall until 2020.
The limits on the lower part of the Czech Republic should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy reasons.
The happy will lead the Czech Republic as the one, putting on the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time each of them will most likely hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to place the load on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
In Delhi, there is hot and high air humidity, and demanding matches are expected to last up to five hundred.
We've got to figure this out.
I'd like to spread it to the weather.
And according to what it would look like, he said he returned during today's Czech selection training in the center of Raj Kumár Khanna.
With one team and the world's 40, Jiří Vesely counts on Friday and Sunday two games.
Luke Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to turn into a two-man position.
I'd like almost everyone to be involved.
I've got it slow in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another surety in the Czech composition should be Štěpánkova's participation in Saturday's 4th.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced debutist who has a balance of 18:4 in Davis's cup.
I don't think it's going to be a happy one.
There's still a chance with Rosola or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who it's going to look like," he said.
It shall be decided according to the development of the two games.
The variant could be Pavlásek, with Vesely surprised in the 1st round by winning the log over Australia.
"He's decent in the trunk," he said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I'd like to show the same performance I've shown since the second set.
"I love this experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The host will put Yuki Bhambri in two games (125th in ATP ranking) which won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he beat the third and fourth hundred ladder players.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both Challengers players and ours have experience with ATP Tour, but we've already seen many times that the ladders in Davis' cup don't decide.
"Deciding the current form, the weather," said Navertil.
Friday's opening two games start at 6:30 SELČ and can stretch because of the weather.
It's supposed to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
It may, however, be played for artificial lighting if necessary.
They've already set it on fire and it's got two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be allowed to occur under the light," said Navra.
Jeremy Corbyn will be debuting at Prime Minister's Requests
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been very enthusiastically expected
The new work leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Requests later, and for the first time will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow office and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday for the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a national anthem has attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn's speaker said he would "stand in a respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow office, Owen Smith, announced to BBC Two's News Night that he would recommend to the Labour Leader the national anthem to sing "no matter" his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, quoted differences in economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "stressed" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of doses.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Shadow Labour and Pensions, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party to be led by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as the leader of the conservatives.
The leader of the workers' party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas of "out of the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will linger on both "necessary responses", and tooth shop, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him on PMQ when he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea that he would let other colleagues stand up for him from time to time because he heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the policy style "Punch and Judy", which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the opinion of leaders, their leadership and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoons and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Joburg work": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises as wages rise in Great Britain
Libra jumped up the following data and showed a recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above by the SABMiller offer objective.
Between May and June the profits of GB including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1,3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after receiving an approach to the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approximation of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
The stocks in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn by sharing as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The stock in the packaging and the paper group Mondi was the biggest drop on the index and dropped by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to "sale."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jumps in the middle of the year in profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for United Kingdom workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it's unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment marshmallows are glowing.
Controversial building's got a stop.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investmenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is to be built in close proximity to the Anez Monastery in the center of Prague, there were also petitions before the Prague office.
The magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a violation of the construction law, because not all the property of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain characteristics, such as land type, distance from neighbouring buildings, a sufficiently clear and comprehensible structure of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the construction," it states.
It also considers that some of the basis for the decision has been published for the original dossier, which has changed.
For example, it is the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the property of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its consent.
It follows from the file that the landowner has, however, confirmed only agreement with the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the location of the building on his premises, writes the construction policy department.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the investment firm, the construction order department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the time limit for initiating the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we respect all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Razeto in a press report.
The project, which is called marshmallow because of the supposedly proposed façade color, causes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city centre in the past to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby homes object that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anez Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was based on a glass façade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPO), and cancelled the authorization of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investmenti with face-shaped windows was approved by NPÚ as well as by the Master's Monuments and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author rejects the outcry of opponents, said he never counted with the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after the pink white candy.
The Czech politician drove the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he took three Syrian refugees along with his crew to the car, who said they wanted to go about a half-mile back.
At the time, according to him, it was not yet criminal in Hungary, he claimed to the people's newspapers.
We knew that the officers of the law did not punish such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the police custody in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The police said they were doing the right thing, but the communications were tied, because they didn't speak very good English.
However, he found the prison to be three hundred.
For example, in our cell about three times four feet [three times four m] in size, 15 refugees from Syria were oppressed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can't he entertain anymore?
Ask the president of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. will answer the questions of readers by the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fuchíková.
You can ask her about amendments to the law on executions in force from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executioners.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and building an IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers join brands such as Dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering flavors in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defence strategy on 29 September when the food, alcohol and hardware seller celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia represents almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade and generates a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South Australia and 30 in the West during the following year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in a solid price base Metcash could cost about $13 million on pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's latest survey found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "very likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the profits from Metcash's food trade, which is supplied by about 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operational developments in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone into counterattack and invest more than $150 million a year to match counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and helps IGA retailers re-invent trade by adding fast-growing food and news from the private.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the pricing and business equipment programmes will catch a fall and hope that the wholesale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more fame for his behavior than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral loss in a recent battle around his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves to be praised for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo commonly called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with an infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon thereafter, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one to pull on Kyrgios and I was supposed to pull on him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a spasm hit him with the possible defeat of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis was unwaveringly defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for the second two-game location behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I was thinking quite intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of the US spasms, but he's not the first player to self-frustrate his own rage on his rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can tell you he won't be proud of this event.
But he did really well, because in the US he was exposed to a very provocative circumstance because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a great deal of recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, works very hard and fits the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, in the wardrobe is highly respected, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I briefly think he deserves to be judged according to his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important match that starts Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the native from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term chair.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy that arose around it [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federerer, Murray and other people point out, in public's eyes he's growing rapidly, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for a while outside the hearing, when he can think about it, it's the best solution for the team and for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and holds migrants back
Following the notification of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and Serbian authorities reacted rebelliously.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time on the country's belts between the two states are those who flee from violence in their native countries, build tents and settle down.
But there's a sense of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants call together "Open the border!" and give order to the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect injury.
During the next days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic says in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-nation bloc did not come with a single immigration policy for continuing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not rely on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's threat situation in the two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Shijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence from a wire line along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point in the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other countries of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are pursuing a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of the 4m fence that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of threat," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
In this we have a clear understanding: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press at the border have been watching a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for domestic defence, said that authorities had caught 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the state's territory.
They have infiltrated the fence by damaging the fence and are now being charged in police custody with committing offences under new laws.
The authorities quickly let the fence be repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with wire.
There was chaos at the main border crossing at Roszke because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and people were pressured.
There were about 20 of them inside, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's jump in front of Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic National Nomination Race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of the democratic primary voters (a 58 percent drop), while Sanders is ranked second with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the opening of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that the candidates will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton's land has been lost under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton's keeping a big head start between women and she's slowing down, but her leadership's narrowing down.
Her support between men has dropped significantly and Sanders only loses five points.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and now they're equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to the senior voters.
Last month Clinton had a two-digit head start in front of Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing five points in this group.
About half the democratic primary voters across the country say they would be thrilled to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her just for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't think it's a surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly inflamed by her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), that it is time for the president to be a woman (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great deal of choice and consistency in the problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidate for president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary electorate would like to see a third think he should not run for office.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, she listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win the general election; however, this number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far different on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely elective is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate is acting as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key features among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, that is, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that opinion.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological outlook.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as state secrets continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of the matter has not affected her at all.
But it's a completely different story between the American public.
Half the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
Public views on this subject were divided in March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion of Clinton.
It's mostly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say that their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among the voters of her party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a decline of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters throughout the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take an opinion on him.
The error margin for sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in the national elections.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey.
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and the others leave the search for support.
Voters from all over the country continue to support Trump by overwhelming majority, and rose from 23% of the support in the latest survey of CBS conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and he lists Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the governor of Ohio John Kasich, is behind with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the run from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error margin for sample 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey released last week showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% of support among the republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
During Carson's upward trend, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon blindly on duty, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump announced last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a pre-emptive brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Denga during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police report that he had blindfolded, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fainted.
The members of the Pi Delta Brethren didn't call 911 right after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and essentially gave priority to the well-being of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by blunt force to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by strains in fraternity and at least one student dies every year from overload since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Mengo, will also be charged with assault by overload and criminal association.
"We want to keep not only the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also urge them to be responsible," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood terminated its relationship with the local branches.
This is the situation where the Fed raises interest rates
The increase in rates will come and the bull market will be crumbling, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it'll take and how long it'll take.
For the economy in particular, it offers the history of a small producer of timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve system in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases start, but rather on trajectory, how long normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the violence caused by the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, head of the global economy Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low level, creating seismic shocks that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy will react based on historical trends:
Given that the market has recorded in the last month or so, the expected increase in rates may make the air slightly unstable.
But once the rise occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for restopping stocks after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
In fact, the market over the past approximately 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - heading towards an increase in rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main stock-exchange company, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares has a tendency to become more significant later in the cycle of increasing rates and the return is beginning to decline.
The recession is a real economic life, but rising rates often help.
Currently, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
Most remarkable is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history when raising Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 increase in rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual increase in GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect its maintenance, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, says Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question "is this time different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for Fed growth all year and all eyes turned to the Federal Committee on the Free Market, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the upward cycles have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the tops of the early recession very quickly after starting recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of the ones that Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now 74 months old and we are still continuing.
A strong return was also called for because the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of shares.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for shares when Fed changes its policy direction.
For bonds, income appears to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle increases the yields of bonds fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategy believes that an increase in rates will bring incomes between long- and short-term bonds closer to the curve.
Debts with high yields often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about straining income," said Kathy Jones, a solid analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
It's interesting that Jones thinks the markets are already adapted by the anticipation of Fed politics.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is wider, the credit margin has expanded and volatility has increased - all the market characteristics as Fed tightens the policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win interest rates after the increase and local products will become more attractive.
Supernational companies with a lot of debt will get worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to overcome within three months after the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsve said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets preceded weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields, as well as low-volatility stocks, also exceeded their percentages of lower quality on average by 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Besides the purely stock game, consumers also benefit from the growing dollar.
Sponsors can also see their profits through higher profits, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, states Member Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham has criticised this station for "stupid"
He feels that he is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
MP Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not the original idea either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" in Classic FM, claims a leading MP and accumulates fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove that they are doing something commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster seems to be "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to be changing into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, these are two examples that I'm wondering when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charges on the ground that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living by music and creating music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," she says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulater Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve audiences than before, because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire because of trampling on business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
conservative member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
You see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced by "a typical BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when the next time it launches a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice shows or spending money on license fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest pace since August and the Black Friday may be on the blame
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth was recorded since the records themselves began in 2000.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for stopping spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain’s main streets become ghost cities.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August was the lowest increase since the very beginning of the 2000 measurement, with only 5 per cent increase compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth rate over the last years and you go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says the IMG sales index editor for the Guardian Andy Mulcahy.
Explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now it's kind of staggering, and that's why it seems to be reverberating.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could delay purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more than the average of buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and to dump several websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers re-contract, can keep customers from other purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion shops.
The Muslims buried the victims of the fall of a crane in Mecca and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group construction magnate.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane crash in Grand Mosque, Mecca.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose their way and gave up their respect to the victims when the first of the fallen got on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosques and had fallen upon a believer.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the building crew of bin Laden's family over a disaster that had also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crane fell in Grand Central Moscow in Mecca were carried down the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj chain.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hades in Mecca will take place, and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the crane's shoulder up when it wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company’s bosses were not allowed to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims convert before the Haj captivity later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any declaration of a collapse of the crane and its commentaries have not been made available.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and the lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binlad's family has been close to the Saudi-Arab ruling family for decades, and they have been carrying out major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Osama bin Ladin was the son of an outcast whose family gave up in the 1990s.
The crash took place in the middle of a strong wind and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom in a bond that must be completed at least once in life by every capable Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be devoted to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of that amount.
Chief B&Q claims East European traders working for cheap trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, claims Veronique Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is open 200 Screwfix stores aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outletts all over the country
Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for Daily Mail
They say the British are dumping hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work in their homes.
If you're doing it with a hammer or a paintbrush, it looks like you're in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do work at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible price is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
At present, most male workers are.
She said that there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women's households that make more household adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the purchase decisions.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of the only five women at the helmsman of companies according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Ms. Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversification is an important topic here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to our house.
Kingfisher announced a decline both in profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took over the closing costs.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
ODS President Zbyněk Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorisation because it would be reflected in the years ahead.
"We have room to find the mechanism we will arrange," Stanjur said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), which said that next year should be valorised over the framework of the law.
Marks defended the grant by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which according to her is not pink.
Higher valorisation next year would, according to her, mean the budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers debate every one of them.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorisation had decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KŠM), pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
This right-wing payout in December will greatly complicate and may even make it impossible, he said.
Czech Parliamentary President Roman Sklenák therefore proposed shortening the time limit for the committee to discuss the standard for 10 or 20 days, and the right one blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
Money is to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
Next year, pensions should rise on average by about a centipede.
The contribution should be given to persons who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December, according to the pension amendment.
Those who lost their pension before their payment in December may also obtain it.
However, they would have to apply in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, with prices rising and a third growth in real wages.
This year's pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion per year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension last year increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714 according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left his plans for a political career, he'll be devoted to science.
The Senate chair, however, had a billionaire according to Russian media almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, which Governor Nikolaj Cukanov, as a candidate of the government party, has defended his post in Sunday's elections with an overview.
According to Russian laws, the senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor's election.
After the election, the senator of the three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication was the fact that he had not lived in Kaliningrad for 20 years as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin found an exception for Yakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of a long-term stay does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy of Tiger Theory is over.
The last drop in the main hero's determination is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janjour decided on grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzera are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he used to have his own will and dreams, he wants to live a decent and free life again.
He seeks to regain his government over his life - and as a solution he chooses to flee from the previous one, he referred to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would be to Bartosh, with whom he had already cooperated on the show Invisible.
Still, he was surprised by the actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break in connection with recovery after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he was obviously a vicious athlete.
He used to ask himself where he was going to sit before he shot another scene.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing rocks, and even climbing a mountain.
And that's what the director pointed out in the record tropical buckets.
According to Bartoshka, women take a tiger to make it a rabbit in time.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't accidentally think of playing outside the tiger rabbit shop.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was made by Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to cherish her husband to death, said Bajgar.
The film parallels the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanja Wilhelmová and Paula Beretová - and the sons-in-laws Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohak.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from the company Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet Company Google has promised to provide another up to 5.5 million dollars ($132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees in Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charity of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled the part of the visit to Telick for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech Member of the European Parliament for the YES movement Pavel Telička postponed the planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities today cancelled his official part of the visit.
According to Telika, this is justified by the EP resolution last week, which criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and which was co-authored by Telečka.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telečka lost the opportunity to discuss with the official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depend on the approval of the authorities, explained in a press statement his Brussels office.
The road, which was planned months earlier, wanted to use Telečka to meet with Parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by ČTK clarified.
The EP resolution condemns "the unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on the European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent verdict against Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chaddíjo Ismail, who was seeking to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the construction of its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not rule out the future creation of a Russian air base in Syria when visiting Novosibirsk.
We don't have that kind of plan yet.
But nothing's been ruled out, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which it has used to date as a service and logistics centre.
According to Russian press reports, however, Russian arms and military supplies to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakia, which remains the garden of Syrian President Bashar Assad for the time being.
But Washington doesn't have a clear understanding of Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, which was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to interpret the concern over the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The White House Speaker Josh Earnest called Asad's support by Moscow a lost bet.
The objectives of Russia's policy in Syria were said to be rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made Syria its own satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is scheduled to be the main theme of the Russian press today's speculation of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas is not to be spoken of by the Russian leader at all.
According to The New York Times today, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama and the Russian president could meet during the UN meeting.
The views among White House counselors are still breaking up.
Today, TASS, with reference to the words of the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on his New York program.
Put sesame oil on a gallbladder diet, the hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing seeds in cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
These are the most common cause of the death of Czechs, according to the Constitution of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not lack sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used on a gallbladder diet.
Essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties three times as often as men.
In general, gallbladder problems concern overweight people who do not sports and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can also be used successfully on a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil consumes, they should be careful about goods from exotic foods.
Asian producers often use overgrown seeds that have a greater taste for pressuring.
Oil thus loses all the active substances, described Ladislav Hachecký, executive director of Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, Czech company, which produces bio virgin oils pressed in cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our fox will be able to lick eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material shall be heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product complies with the criteria for the special virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood disorders.
The Czech favourite among oils is sunflower.
The research by Jarmila Hamerska, who led the University of Masaryk, found that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for roasting, it is already starting to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and is especially suitable for diets that help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduces most cholesterol levels.
In case of heart problems, care should be taken for the total amount of fat and calories taken.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sunflower oil; 99 calories in a spoon of rapeseed oil.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sesame and hempy 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator will continue to last longer.
Old oil is especially known for its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no contusion at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are one of the so-called superfoods, and hemp oil is therefore considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this designation, it owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be made by the body itself and must be accepted from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European Clinical Nutrition Journal has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, but the Icelandics accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the menu as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using cannabis oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that you found this oil on your way to consumers confirms that Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon after a morning.
Hemp oil is not a good taste, but it strengthens the immunity perfectly, advised by Daniel Vlček of the beautiful company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the most important nation is American grillers.
For one household there is 1.4 grill.
All over the world, there are various grilling competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs aren't even in the background.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not grill.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating several hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this, while keeping the good substance healthy while grilling?
Generally speaking, during the grilling process itself should be saved by fat.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils are then also lost to the body of a beneficial substance, which is otherwise obtained by consuming oils from foods modified at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Horrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolovska are immediately disposed of by grape oil.
Amazingly, it complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen is characterized by a unique quality of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the advantages of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the positive content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil we also help to increase our external beauty - improves skin elasticity, is used to treat acne and helps care for dry and brittle hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for cooking cold foods, for example when tasting salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, grilling can be used immediately in two ways, marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their suspense.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, acidity will be supplied with apple vinegar and will result in meat softening.
The spices add a lot of flavor and oil cans and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils, it can flow through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how do we move on?
Extra virgin oils are marked by only a few drops to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this way.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the oil, and prevent the burning of the food.
The preparation of annexes is also an essential part of grilling.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bundle of shakes • 1 cup of chopped cucumbers • 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a sliced shake, chopped cucumbers, and large sliced peach cubes.
According to the taste of salt and resist, you can also taste the ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dig in a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, then salad can be sprinkled with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only depends on medication, but also on the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, and social legal advice is included in the care of these patients, as well as recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally affected by the patient himself.
The more he struggles with the disease, the longer he can work and the more he needs to change the way he lives.
As doctors point out, the passiveness of the patients relaxes the area for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when a patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to a variety of myths, such as that the disease automatically causes them to end up in a wheelchair.
And that is why the page Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of multiple sclerosis, there is a twofold claim that the disease begins treatment earlier, rather than affecting the doctor’s ability to do so.
It's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory phase where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Very important is in people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often resolves the weakening of the lower limbs or imbalances.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, to improve walking, to strengthen the pelvic bottom, to reduce swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says MUDr. Martin Kövári, primary physician at the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests in a slightly different way in each case.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, mobile activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and it strengthens their confidence.
"In exercise, endorphins are also washed up and people feel good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Rásová of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vineyard.
By influencing the physical side, we affect the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we intervene in the mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"In the past these patients have been saved, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the advantage of the Rehabilitation Clinic and the Physical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physiotherapy is to keep a person as long as possible self-sufficient as possible, including work placement.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergotherapists in order to provide each person with a compensatory aid that he can afford.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it'll shake most people up.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we should go to someone, not try to take everything on our own thighs.
"I work with them to conclude eventually that even with the Handicap can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't produce and process immediately.
Yet, along with super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for composition-forming composites, you can run into something as ordinary as mermaid ovens.
In a drum, which resembles a pot of cotton candy, in a pile of ovens the edges of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine are softened.
"So far no one has found anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, Director General of the manufacturer of the airport doors Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Letňany, the former Letov manufactures a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the world's only door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which part of which is built in Prague, also include passengers in the first and higher classes on the upper decks of the world's largest airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Maybe the momentary keys are allowed by the company to set up twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a control record, the Prague race should have something to explain to the airbus or Boeing auditors who travel regularly to see if the door is manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
Human sense, however, has not yet completely replaced advanced technology.
There's 1,500 thread on one door to A320.
Those smiths have to knock by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the catchable hammer, they'll know if the thread's broken properly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The thread can rise from zero to 0.13 millimeter above the plane's surface.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When you're in control, it's time for a trained touch.
When a controller crosses a string of strings, he'll know if anyone is out of tolerance.
Then he takes in the exact detour.
Food flight before 1989 programme of the L-39 training military aircraft.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
At that time, it was combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection procedure for an emergency door supplier for model A321.
Talking to Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable supplies," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained in love if Letov had not taken part in the Prague conference of the international airline association of the French group Latecoere in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with the Airbus.
The next day, talks with the French began, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoe bought a Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
Immediately in 2000, the assembly of parts of the door for A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck door arrived for A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of composites for supplies for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get into these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of delivery for 20 or 30 years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after taxes of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position between aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoe has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 specific production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made any doors to the planes.
Get certificates that production processes meet the requirements of customers, and keep them in repeated checks according to the Dubsko million koruna.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and stricter.
We need to train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is preparing a process for zinc and nickel coating that will replace the harmful cadmium that has so far been used for human health.
Although they received the request from the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their labs and then compare the results with ours, brings the Dubski way in which customers control them.
The reward is for Prague's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race standing today, the production of embryos is falling.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
The replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible for a Brazilian or European manufacturer or very complicated.
However, this does not mean that he could say any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It shows how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, sum of pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we'll process it, says Dubsky.
Half the hall where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall there is a new semi-robot line for threading and mounting doors for the innovative model A320 Neo.
It's going to speed up and be more precise.
"This is the trend that the installation of aviation is taking away," Dubský adds.
Retreat has a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 pieces of the new model A320 so far.
Just a few meters away, there will be a line for the complete assembly of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, to install certain electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new A350 Airbus programme, which will compete with American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge loan for the company when it can process composites besides metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, Latecoere is available for food production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in the Letov area where he's staying.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
Now it's 800, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of schedule, how many hundreds of new airplanes are booked each year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although it has contracts a few years ahead, the Prague Latecoere parent company faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off the loans.
Finally, Latecoe was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
In late August, part of the loans were exchanged for shares.
Believers gained a share of 37.4 per cent in the company by raising capital by 57.4m euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed a new shareholding of EUR 222.9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, it raised capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
The average increase in contracts is expected to be four per cent per year until 2017.
The contract book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to four-year production.
French media say that Latecoe can finally breathe again after years on droplets.
The Czech race in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
The group’s sales are accounted for by 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a greater proportion of the state's coal charges.
The change in the fees for mining is expected to bring more than CZK 427 million into the state treasury in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipalities' budgets is to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, about 450 million crowns and 150 million crowns were charged to the municipalities.
Approximately 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns came from the mining of brown coal.
The novelty is also calculated by increasing the remuneration from the mining areas with the permitted mining per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments is to continue to be wholly owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to 100 million annually instead.
The amount of the mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government's regulation.
Remuneration shall be calculated as the result of the amount of growth generated and the rates for each type of growth.
According to the government, the change is due, inter alia, to the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting a fee by government regulation does not have to be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging the undergrowth which is a state property.
The fees shall be paid only by the municipalities whose territory is affected by the extraction.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the village's money and a quarter of the state will be received.
The same ratio will be applied in the case of mining of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that will be taken from the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide the Bank’s rescue service.
Today's proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that it would harm the communities affected by mining and by the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as they have done so, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Ovvit) elected in the Ustak region.
Prior to the rise in unemployment in Mosteck, KSČM Member Hana Aulicka warned.
Kadner and Aulick had failed to propose an amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for work.
According to the mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 per cent agreed on over the long term.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should therefore not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government accepts.
However, it considers that the increase in employment charges is profitable.
According to the rapporteur for the Milan Urban Amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal goes beyond the limits, it will have an impact on income for both the state and the village, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the lower Czechoslovakian army should not fall until 2020.
The limits on the lower part of the Czech Republic should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy reasons.
Time for a decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching US Federal Reserve plan to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey by 80 Reuters economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event, because it's been years since the Fed's reduced rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of a zero-leaf and start the process of standardising interest rates," says Angel Ubidine, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy was doing quite well, recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready to increase, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great odds against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day to his colleague - wrote a message saying that he was "summer" for the first time and that he wished he could take it back, was discovered on Tuesday by the government authorities.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi reported that Lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police to his house.
He said: “I shot my wife last night, ” and he also mentioned that there is a“ cute dog ” in the house that “will not bother anyone, ” but is upset.
The police asked for the names of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why the house was shooting.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, Amy Prentiss’s body was found and a handwritten note from Lamb saying: “I’m so sorry, and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a message, Lamb set out on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The Dean of William LaForge University said that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “something was obviously happening in Mr Lamb’s head. ”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb supposedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, the government authorities said that there was no "no evidence" about the "merciful triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, said that she was “a great person. ”
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shocked."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as Sun Herald put it, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the cops caught him on the freeway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran off into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
I'm sure all these things are taxing themselves.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in Lize Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and removed it from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by the reckless action of Hector Moren in 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw penetrated the PSV area.
Nine minutes was treated on the field and oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported tomorrow or maybe the following day and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has a very hard time, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in his dressing room, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and won't be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he'll play this season again.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penal kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their news, words cannot express how destroyed I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded the injuries of Luke Shaw in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the field with such a wound, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in the Mexican match against Van Gaalov Holland in the World Cup 2014.
"It is very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the seriousness of such a injury, it is not good," said Coco.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like it touched him [Moreno], but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel really bad about this. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This thing every parent knows: When a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn to remember it almost.
Of course you can't be David Cameron.
At the request of the provider of children’s schemes to appoint a favorite children’s book, Prime Minister Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seuss, chose.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and strong content, I loved reading to my children because behind it was always a picture or message that I had never seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the history of the books according to the 2012 film elevator, which added further figures and details to fill out the short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is the brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it were not suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads as a summary elevator of Lorax, which is on the site of Internet Movie Database, and starts with the words, "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is commodities, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be familiar with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by a scavenger, trees-throwing industrialist once-ler, who despite the protests of the main Loraxa, a shrinked, musty creature who "speaks behind the trees."
With the most likely so relatively little significant PR task got an assistant who has never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
Speaker Downing Street said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of failing England, but he still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England has chosen for this tour, I think the repetition of the 3-0 defeat that she suffered last time in the trial series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't exactly rule out winning guests.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this regiment formation and collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only with youth positiveness.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth stepped out of England's team in a series of experiments and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to warn Adam Lyth is a tough nut for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement because — and I mentioned this earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centurys, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more jockeys for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely 100%, and that did not surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the bat gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you can do to keep your mouth shut is that in the Caribbean, England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a gunman that I value very positively.
He's an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all of this will depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen starts by Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he kept four quicks, was filed and I have no objection to her.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there is no big difference in that.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 trials before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was intrigued by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a spring, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decided for the young.
They'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jaywardene, a Sri Lankan batonist, as a consultant for trial matches may be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful playing men who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless sparks to the team.
I've always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even though they are voices that say consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes ease and refresh the atmosphere.
Colleague of Colly Durham Ben Stokes got one day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
Brexit could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unimaginable strategy of renegotiation of David Cameron for the maintenance of Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with each past day and without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn will take the whole situation around Europe to the head of the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take place on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbin and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of the British egocentric agendas, the sharing of concessions and the disturbing changes to the treaty that they generally did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they did not want it even if they starved social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home with the words that the allies win for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unbiased Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German prudent chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it has been for too long of continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they themselves do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP style notes during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a friend claims.
"Re-negotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know for their own account how fierce Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are the press oligarch barons because they were not, during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a ratio of 2:1.
They may well remember the name Boris Johnson, a captivating Europortunist who made his name as the Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free thugs, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo-non-minor departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt the same way about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a mad gorilla, you had to throw her bananas so that she wouldn't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair accepted the principle of an repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a card of dismissal.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that I shouldn't waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of re-admissioning the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I say, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of the crazy tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly go for it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbin's appointment as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70 years when his old father fought on television about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "under all circumstances" - Benna's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, or what JC told his colleagues and members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever background there is, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to share - remember, he has touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of all-day television transmission and especially in faith, paranoia and betrayal, which are social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as of course, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbin's basic mistreatment of EU membership - in line with their Bennet besieged economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric debate between leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic encroachment.
As with his mistreatment of NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspected voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's start of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise the review on electronic published by Public Health England
The statement by the government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, by researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "major" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet's journal last month attacked "an extremely chaotic base" on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for BMJ questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public could expect PHE’s claim to be "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called for the analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the responsibilities of the public health of BAT in the sustainability report, states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an electronic cigarette producer, but not funding previously obtained from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
There is no reason to select panel members, but there are several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
A meeting in PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "expresses," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claim in BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers is going to die because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking and smoking-related diseases each year, costing NHS £2 billion per year.
With clear emphasis on current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end up with East Enders, former Director Channel 4 claims.
Former director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public service programs, which would probably only be followed by a handful of people, in difficult broadcast times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for six years working on Channel 4.
"I am struggling with the idea that the BBC is setting up and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast to rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the Communications Commission in the Upper House as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep a licence fee, which I am not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce the creation of at least as regards programs that others do not produce or issue.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and of course ridiculous.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be financed without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, the EastEnders is another, and of course made on domestic soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasters.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up with ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those former executive director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggert lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more hiccupic BBC public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often they cannot measure the audience, but they fulfil their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocrite mission justifying £4bn income from license fees, "But, of course, we are doing all these disgusting programs that no one is looking at."
They broadcast them at a time when no one looks at them.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a year, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its reith mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as educational - it used to be 1% television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take the form of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, explain and entertain."
On the topic of partnership Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on TV, and connect with commercial reporters so that we could all see them online.
‘Sonogenesis’ or ‘brain cell control’ using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the worms are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small worms change direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses that are insensitive to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenesis, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, stated to the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure whereby electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient’s brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani has found that the reaction will come when they are placed in fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the body of the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves operate in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
With sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, reports Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the worms using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when he used ultrasonic modified worms like this, the sound waves were enhanced by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light.
But Chalasani has heard that sonogenesis could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also be used to treat insulin-producing cells and cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
It's a press release that's embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the Amnesty International arms market.
The menacing drones!
Footbands that break ankles!
Shrimp shots!
And electrically stunning earrings that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to emphasize the will of the British government to sell arms to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice in ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also led by the emergence of posters at bus stops and subways that require a second view.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from September 15th to September 18th?" reads one, using a letter from the London metro with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This September will be a swarm of arms dealers coming down to DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen Key, which allegedly "will gain access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and expert assistant at Essex University, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they must get out in the real world to have an impact on society in order for their art to have an impact on society.

Video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency working without a right to pay and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising of arms trafficking - he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign that he's trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of a more realistic, risky corporate advertising, but "by adding a variety of colors and animations, we have achieved that they bind more people."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," said Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the United Kingdom government to take measures and ensure that the torture apparatus is not illegally dealt with on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US Army to "on the arm of the launch AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects beyond the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.

11 years ago, I moved to college as an inconceivable nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but until now, I am remembering the tense smiles of those whom I have disturbed - and numerous, prolonged complaints of others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorms can move from a little bit to the nerves going down to a total shock.
It's tempting to chat: tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why you honestly don't hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA's yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't talk to if your eyelashes were in one fire and they'd release fire extinguishers.
Let the people have their space.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, movie evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and dress.

Introverts in college will come in short.
Your room should be a haven, but a lot of colleges change into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to see when your classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a knock-off.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One of the guys in my dorms used to think that if the door wasn't locked, he'd be invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to the roast.
Because you started going to college at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door, and a performance with a canvas of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions."
Offering house manners is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and perhaps it will all end by making your face a delicious surprise.
Of course, that's the object of being a decadent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and stiffness will likely prevent others from pretending to sleep if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing an entire chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk stolen into your tea?
Check twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decadent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because they were three at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was to turn up the music.
When they finally shut up at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours, and then she played her own music out loud, locked the door, and went to her three - hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future even went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you had mistaken your roommates for your future though they slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day and maybe take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you won't tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate isn't 100% your future though, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At the lofty moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin border between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer, but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve had a heartwarming experience when she was pregnant with a seven - year - old Vítka.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone in preparing and raising her offspring.
With the situation I dealt with relatively quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for a positive.
The uncertainty and being alone with my child made me try not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, today Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
She had already met on the Internet at the chateau of the Elder Village, with which they began to talk about favorite films.
Vásek Eva and Vítka even brought home from the maternity ward, but he didn't get too involved in the role of stepfather.
"For a while then he withdrew from the program," said Eva in documentary series Four in this 3.
The motive of the third series of the Czech TV series is to look for happiness on the second attempt.
Taking care of Vítka and the family’s financial security helped her to cope with part - time work and the great help of her mother and the help of her aunt.
Not even the prospects of responsibility for a stranger's child ultimately ruined Veskov's affection for Eve.
They've definitely come together around Vítka's second birthday, and he now understands Vázka as his father and he also refers to him as his father.
Although Vašek already has two grown daughters, paternity in its 60 ’ s enjoys it, and children are also given more attention.
In addition to the Vítka, two - year - old Leontínka and the twins arrived.
"Your family has been affected in some way naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother has never spoken much to me in relationships," she thinks, smiling Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ella were born with the Empress incision after Eve had been diagnosed with pregnancy during pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which occur in excess in the blood that are pregnant and manifest in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for an unborn child who is threatened with premature childbirth and death, and most of the time, the mother will give birth willingly.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and village happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
The Emica was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where Vaškova's niece, who was able to take over and accommodate her, also works.
Elinka was bigger, and as soon as I was transferred from IIP to my room, I had her with me, describing the challenging period after Eva gave birth.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release babies who in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the children in Eve’s foster home did not make Eve happy.
"I was madly stricken by my husband and children," recalls a tough moment in the department six weeks four times a mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen, and the doctors released Eve and her twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirths broadcast ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
A large number of families can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to have enough with electric double boards and cramped conditions.
Although the house did not grow larger, Vašek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make the cooking more comfortable for six people.
If it gets worse, we'll take a cab.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or delusion of the house.
So far, we've made up a lot better than we expected.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the baby is sometimes overstepped, but at least we are all nearby, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to any situation.
The village's work as a light bulb in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes takes off on the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At 60 years of age, according to his own words, caring for the finances of the family and children physically manages, how long will it take?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family," admits Eva to the level of questioning for the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly hot for the employer.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can swap cabs, and she's a cute blonde.
Apple's got a yo-yo effect.
There's a display for everything.
A more efficient processor, a larger resolution camera, a stronger chassis or a touch-recognition display, are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend in Apple was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous generation.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in favour of the news was indeed negligible.
However, this is not the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in a smaller model, then by 20 grams.
On the one hand, you can't be surprised, last year's affair with the bending of Apple's pockets has suffered a lot.
The chassis news is thus made of a more resistant aluminium alloy of 7000, which is also reflected on the weight.
But there's a much greater impact on the display.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, making the displays recognize the power of the touch.
To this end, it was necessary to provide a further layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice over the previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams per 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest used component.
The weights of only 143 grams are then achieved with this news thanks to the fatting bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible on the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As long as the new display technology is practical, it will only appear when used.
The first users will be able to try it already on Friday 25 September when sales of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the wolves been breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicca, archaeologists succeeded in finding interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern man's habitation from different times, including wall paintings, remains of instruments and so on and so on.
In layer 23A, which according to the instruments is dated to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists discovered something that very much resembles the rest of the breakfast buffet.
For there were traces of oatmeal, which apparently passed through the process of producing so popular flakes today.
With it, the grains will first get wet today, then dry, save the packaging, the so-called plough, then burn and spread.
In the cave of Paglic, it was possible to discover grains that were apparently heated or heated, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least it indicates traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for the magazine PNAS that there would be a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but the similarity is really very visible.
We also have no evidence of how people of flakes could eat, but the idea that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm is, of course, offered entirely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture was established.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have been ahead of agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New reporting of stations in the Transport Business of Brno.
So once again I listened to the report of the names of the stops on the trolleybus: Hnusáčková, Ghost, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so the male voice report was a little less understandable than it was before when the stops were called in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better known than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the travellers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but this was certainly taken from studio recordings obtained in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the frame of the bus engine.
I've lived in Brno for a few decades, so the correct names of all these stops I can remember, so I don't need this report, but strangers from abroad who don't confess in Brno and for which these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may be at the end where they went by mistake, then claim that the stop they were supposed to go to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of voter - but better again - should be made again, and this time under the color of the usual traffic noise and engine billing, in which the sound of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to continue to listen to the names of the stations of Water Herspice, Schmírová, or then the Diorna in the creaking lair that I moved into in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the one day that the speaker of the stop changed.
I understood that report quite well the other day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track records.
Today, few know what the biggest and the smartest of the party's governments were called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't crash with your associate chief, come a minute ahead of you and it seems he's not in the mood," the dispatcher noted while I was signing into the arrival book.
Thanks, I'll take care of it.
Tell me I'm on my way to the districts to revise the small mechanics.
That's not going to work. There's a checkup today.
They're all so fucked up, it's horrible.
What's this all about?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time you will be.
I ran into the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief showed up.
Stuck, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted him respectfully and quickly turned on the two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning," answered the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man had answered.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, the elderly lady who I very much appreciated.
She said she was even the chief before her comrades put her down.
They're check-ins, and you'll come like this.
How many times have I asked what these complex background checks are, but no one wants to talk too much about it.
They say they're once every three years, everyone has to go to them, and it's pretty embarrassing.
At least for some.
I think I'll see.
I pulled out of the drawer a folder with periodic reports and then a phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me right away," the chief answered.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good afternoon, Comrade Chief, I've come upon your order," I reported, I've barely entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk, looking at some sort of banner.
"Colleague mechanic," he said after a while without lifting his head, and he kept looking at it carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the ladder on the table, leaned against the chair, and looked at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, pussy look.
I'm not sure.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that I had worked very well in office over the past few months and that he was very pleased with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
And now this?
Realize you're a line-side technician, and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I felt that I had been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I had been so raised, and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
For the Chief, it was like a red turkey dress.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," the superintendent said.
Plus, you're still wrong about addressing your superiors.
You'll say "sir" one more time and you'll say "partner" again.
But I'm no chief to you, but Comrade Chief.
The viceroys are comrades to the viceroys, the masters are comrades to the masters!
Remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a simple civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work or a comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It is not your privilege that you are not on the side," said the chief, who in the meantime calmed down a little.
There's going to be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone something wasn't his preference, it didn't look good with the one in question.
For a while, he was stabbing me with a cold, pussy look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his elevated ticks.
He was only a few years older and played god, actually a comrade god.
Jovial, puffy, authoritarian, arrogant, as he pleases at the moment.
They all kicked him out.
Come on, he's the chief.
In fact, not all, the chairman of the party organization, as all the parties, but also the non-partners, were tickling him.
But the chief was tickling many, especially those with whom he could exercise his supremacy.
He just hit me for a total shit.
I thought of something about ass and it cost me enough to keep it out of his face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a pickpocket, not even to being an ardent official.
What would I use two kids for?
And then there's the house!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all yet, you can go," the chief terminated his audition and began to scrutinize again the banner he had previously in his hand.
They called me at 7:30.
Everyone in the office has been there and they've been asking questions about what and how, and they've been saying that yes, that it's going to be okay.
Only Jožin had a bit of a say as to how his habit was, that they could not throw us all out, because the job would have to be done by his fellow chief himself with his loyal ones, and that he would not threaten us.
The word "companion" pointed out, as if he knew what the old man had killed me for this morning.
There was a nice meeting at the chief's.
Comrade Chief, at his desk and at the long advisory table, other associates who were to decide whether or not to be my official.
Kadrovák, President of the ROH, a staff writer, a reference for special purposes, something in the way of countering the war, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of a party organization.
I knew him from the rack.
A simple line worker, who was a match to the rods or forks tossing the gravel.
But he's also an ex-watchman.
There was a rumor that there was no funny thing about him back then, a pretty beast.
Bad languages said he went to school in seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the crime was lifted, he ended up on the scrape at the dealer's.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in my neck, an inconspicuous gun.
Kadrovák read the opinion from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, it's good, I've thought about it, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the opinion from the Civil Committee, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of long-standing members of the party refused to come before the inspection committee and subsequently resigned, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me very hard.
The fireman noticed and stopped reading.
The Chief has instructed him to proceed.
It's just been worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM, and that's where I was won as a candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents on the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I also had a wedding at the National Committee.
I let down the trust of the parties in the worst way.
That's why I was crossed out of the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother when she died, I fixed a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
This is all a negative attitude towards the role of the party.
When the station attendant read it, only knocking the chief's pencil into the table board interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was looking at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
And I kept saying in spirit, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could've fixed the bends without some fucking check.
But now?
She took the career of a performance officer for herself before she started.
Go back to the company?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief's gonna leave me for an hour.
"My comrade, how did you examine the comrade in question here?" interrupted the silent chief's question of the coach.
Well, according to the previous employment report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, it wasn't more than once.
He spatters sweat on his shorts, frowns nervously as if he had been checked himself.
He nodded and handed the chief some paper.
"No," said the chief, with a sign of joviality, which was often the harbinger of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with distinction, studied industry, worked in the task force as a locksmith, fulfilled the standard on average by 100 percent.
But it's missing the point.
Where did you get that judgment, comrade?" he turned again to a caboose who felt that somehow he was beginning to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a caboose.
A friend here gave it to me on the way in.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he came to our house, he went to the precinct to the company," he said.
And there's no need for an opinion, which was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you put this piece of paper into the technical function, it was enough for you," the chief said.
The cadaver frowned nervously, and he had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the matter and the coach was obviously relieved.
For now, he's standing still.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes were dark, I was hot.
Following the tide of remorse and accusation, I knew that I was the most repulsive creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by substantiating an incomplete assessment, I mistakenly misjudged the comrade of the Cadra referee, and I did not understand why the judgment was incomplete when I received it from the coachman at the factory.
I also lived an antisocialist life that, at the time of building real socialism, supports the realms of religious darkness, even participating in them.
That, uh, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I'd still do it, and I prayed silently that it would end.
I didn't care.
I didn't care if I took off as a mechanic.
I didn't care they'd take the dealer away from me.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of my comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party's chairman suddenly answered and strongly interrupted the chief's levity.
This is where a comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could possibly be worse for a young man than closing the door to his side in time!
To open it again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he that tally or papyrus from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat mistaken comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty, which no one will save you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
A comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes but also loves.
When the president was finished, no one even turned up.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade President," the Chief of Staff said in an effort to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk to you, you'd have heard that's exactly the conclusion I was going for.
They all shook their heads in agreement, but they didn't seem to believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate care provider," I said on my return to the office and wept.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch with Eve's engineer.
Those silences listened to my unrelated rendering of fresh experiences and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked me if I could have some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and made cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about curvature practices.
How one judgment, often full of praise, will be given to a person, and another, where there is dirt, will be sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had to go, but on the screws at the dealer's, so my factory buddies didn't know where to send it.
What about our cadaver?
He's just getting old where he would eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"He's got it from the old man," she said ominously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party president?
Basically a much worse chief, no human being.
Zero from a cruiser with great power.
The water for the coffee started to boil and the office filled with the smell of freshly watered coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup, and the silences mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
Now they won't fire me, and the next checkup is in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief will not forget my day.

The symbol of the alien is alive.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
You can see it from a distance, because it's located at 15 meters high.
People from around here call him "the wind of Chlum".
For the municipality 150 inhabitants became even one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the municipality gained at the occasion of the reunion of relatives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign then and we wanted to have it on the sign, of course, everyone around us knows it," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chum's wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
Only in 1910 did the Flemish representatives decide on a solution that was then in line until the mid - 1980 ’ s.
In the village near the branch of Čihov, they were allowed to dig a deep well seven metres.
Three years later, the well was complemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which drew water into the tank at the highest point of the village near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on Moravia with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the memorial inscription on the ground floor boundary of the construction of the mast.
After several repairs and falls of the wind cycle, the pump served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the battle for water began to be written: On that day a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a dysfunctional general symbol and a local rarita.
The Dominant was operated at this year's reunion of relatives.
Only in 2008 did the Chumskys decide to repair the wind cycle again and put it back on track.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced on average by half a meter.
The wheel was placed on the mast, but it had to be brought down in the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the suitable material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
Then the Chumma Dominant rested for several years, stripped under the roof.
However, as of this June, the bike on the high-rise is spinning again.
On the occasion of the gathering of relatives, the village had the replica of the bicycle adjusted and again placed on the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws useful water from the well only into the seizure blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it, because there wasn't enough water in the well.
It was at least empty.
"Then, in autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the windshield from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind cycle has reached the general sign, but it is the only species of this species in the whole Highlands.
A similar element in the sign is the honour of local technical monuments, such as in Chvalkovice and Zelena Hora on Vyškovska, Kuželova on Hodonínsk, Partutovice on Přerovsk or in Polica on Vjetínsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafatu, she confessed to the resistance of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at the pre-stage press conference.
We were trained by Georg Hagi at the time, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I give Sparta a goal now.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who won 60 matches for the Romanian team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a hitchhiker, he will face the invasions of Spartan offensives.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Greek battle of Spartan Hibsh.
And he's got a pretty good idea what he can do on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their games.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he also went to Sparta, said Goian.
He did not name any other football players at the Prague club, so the direct question came to him whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly scolding look, he directed at the Czech journalist.
The helpless expression in my face meant, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a while, he kept quiet.
We've seen some videos, and I've noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fataie.
The Spartans know about Goian very well.
"He has experience in larger clubs, it can be said that he is defending Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
In time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchester units, from Steauy, but headed for the Italian Palermo, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a large team, regularly plays European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
For me, this game is a favorite, but we're playing home and we want to start a group with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we'll try to win, Goian said.
I am in peace with Slovak goaltender Tomáš Košicki, who is very pleased with his rival from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new residence should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading company shares on Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the framework of the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the movement of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
In order to enter the Stock Exchange, Prague completes a prospectus of securities, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and the related transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no public or new investors will be offered any shares in this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decided - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any share offer could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offer in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of the objectivity of Czech television in informing about the migration crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news coverage of Czech TV.
And how did she stand?
When they teach journalism at the Faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today's broadcast of the Czech Television Event.
About 80% of the media coverage was devoted to the migration crisis.
Only at the first minute when ČT reported on the unrest at the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers called them euphemistic patience - throwing stones and attacking with metal rods), did the current migration propaganda - evaluate the names of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for nonprofit organisations that criticise mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Travel of refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee, not migrant.
Most strikingly, the Czech Republic uses only consistent images of small children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, however, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have the same patterns as Communist aghits.
I must say, as an ex-journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once went to a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've had fish moved to the Umakart toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with a change of imperfection, i.e., not reproducing that rebirth from the caterpillar to the beetle and the young looks like an adult, only small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lazily lose them.
First by hand and later by chemical means.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals for their destruction.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, they were successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into their nest and then he wouldn't let the queen produce a new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went by, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became increasingly attached to the view that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and bugs is I wouldn't be able to make my karma worse by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish don't get behind our backs, let them eat the peels of their skins, some of those invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence was violated by a spider after a while.
It was a common kind of penitent who had long sat on the ceiling.
We thought he lived on occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he has lived with us for several years, we have found that he feeds mainly on fish and that his numbers seem to have maintained a lucrative number.
We have found out that she is a female through regular contact with every need we have ever met.
Because we witnessed a romantic conversation with a partner about a third less, as he carefully threw the spider’s fibers at him so that he would not be eaten before reaching the exorcism.
It took about three days when they didn't move and they didn't respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games were played, we later found the remains of the dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging in her neighborhood.
They're gone soon.
They were eaten by their mother, worked elsewhere.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she went away or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
The truth is, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that former toilet dweller.
For a while, she observed our behavior carefully from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our failure to attack as a friendship.
The initial condition of the somewhat multiplied fish again decreased, and the spider was calmly looking for his usual activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter, in the meantime, grew up when the use of the nightgown was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've had enough of pouring its contents forever.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
However, in order to maintain her habit, her daughter found an excuse in that spider she saw very well when she was wiping.
Our talk of the spider seeing, the happiness of the mother's house has not been taken at all.
She made her nightgown cry and scream.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There was a time when the spider had to be in order to command the developmental movement of the daughter.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and found across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I parted with him as a friend, but I still felt as if I were throwing away a relative after so long of cohabitation.
We assumed that the fish would begin to appear more often and would start to multiply geometrically.
The world wonders, a week or two, we didn't get any.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider, like an ants, was somehow growing that the toilet environment wasn't as good for their existence as we thought.
But then came the first pieces of medium size, and they were creaking again.
I had to come up with another theory about the reason they disappeared, and I figured that their connection to the spider had to be because if they didn't see him, he was hidden somewhere else, and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm.
More like, I'm not making any illusions about their eyesight.
Some light showed shyness, but that it would respond to wavering or rapid movements, it did not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's forgotten her nightgown.
All that's left is to attract another spider.
I'm already sending my wishes to the air, and I hope they haven't shut me down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-cycle.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century are likely to never cease to be fascinating to mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deeply that the fetus was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the minds of people, he entered his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic relationship.
It is also not possible to ignore its explanation of the photoeffect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the scribbling and system of knowledge of popular theory of relativity is so confusing for many that they prefer easy examples to get to know.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: the clock near your loved one seems a minute; the minute in the hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I have allowed myself from his entire collection of famous quotations to choose these ten that have literally caught me.
Smart people try to solve problems, genius tries not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But at any time, the only one who can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in that fourth, it's gonna be stakes and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there is no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it and 5 minutes solving it.
The world's hardest thing to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive not to introduce Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín region are waiting for a change of 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four are kept in black numbers this year," said Haytman Stanislav Misák.
The total profit of the circuit facilities is about 32 million crowns at the moment.
The share is mainly higher than that of insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Větín, Uherské Hradišti and Zlín, it tends to build buildings that will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
A long time ago, when we were shopping mainly for machines, it was over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them top health care will not be possible, he justified the plans of the Regional Health Deputy Lubomír Nečas.
He's looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In Svetín they are now selecting suppliers of the new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kromeríž, they have planned the addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradište wants to install a new interior for about 200 million by this year's open central pavilion.
And the Zlinska Bata hospital will have a long-delayed construction of a new central income and interior that will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a fundamental and often the biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Věra Prousková, director of St.
The five-storey building is expected to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for the patients.
The changes that the patients will most likely recognize will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients in one room have only one toilet on the floor, beds are inoperable, windows are inoperable, and health care professionals do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our interior was built five decades ago and is now on the verge of its existence," said Zlin hospital director Pavel Calábek.
In a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half the finished Hungarian Hraště.
Central income is already on the table, and within three years it will be internalized.
"We will pay the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sladek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profit is still the highest, and it was not even two years ago when perhaps the Zlin hospital faced almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdak, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the hospital are also looking forward to improvement.
Over the course of ten to fifteen years, it will go to repairs, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year the repair of the capture station will be ready, then the construction of the dialysis, or the construction of the building for the new magnetic resonance, will begin.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after dealing with his European colleagues that the other Czech States are pushing for the adoption of quotas for redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
It also points out that no one has yet explained to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should be kept if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get the answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Khuvanec told reporters.
Can you describe in particular the position with which you came to the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and abroad of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they redistribute.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration places, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand recently, now it's one hundred twenty thousand.
When is it going to be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
There's almost no one here, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country are ambitious to go to our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, namely Syria and other countries, is extremely close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to come to us, but 15 hundred people have already committed ourselves.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We have committed ourselves to receiving 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, there will be 1,100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detection facility and we'll treat them as much as we've caught them.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe, if we can keep people registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that, if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet in place, it may be that we will not even keep the 1,100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will return to Germany upon their arrival.
If we can hold them off during the asylum procedure, we'll handle the asylum procedure with them.
If they are Syrians, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of European statistics receive international protection.
Then they'll get documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people are going to end up in targeted countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move in.
This is the second project that is under way so far, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that at the ministers' meeting, the other states were not willing to discuss it with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas, but offering no solidarity step that would unlock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is going to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the report shall be disseminated in order of hours after all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It calls for another migration wave that's going to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - just to discourage the migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Make it clear that they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars arrived in Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the sabotage of this state, including the police, the courts, the state's offices.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, 50 percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
On the first day that Germany introduced the controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
Where is it going to go to make border checks tighter?
We were afraid of capture in the hundreds of people's order.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have a few hundred seats available in stone detectors.
Of course, all the people we're keeping will be returning to Austria in seven days.
We do it on a standard basis.
Rakas are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary, it's complicated, and the Greeks -- that's a completely useless story.
So where's the breaking point?
Does it have to be a grand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will drain our capacity to the point that crisis plans will come.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister to call an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation were to occur, the government could de facto meet immediately and by a single resolution would decide to strengthen the police on the military, give it customs administration, or prison service, as appropriate.
The ultimate option is the state of emergency, which has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, the Schengen border we have only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of debts at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid her debts.
The football players were looking forward to their money.
Soccer Slavia stood up for the first time on Tuesday because of insolvency proceedings before a court of law.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns submitted a proposal to Online Services from Pacific Samoa.
Lawyer Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours not to declare bankruptcy over Slavija.
And she had to say she had an argument.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavia became the great Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also demonstrated by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the top club sent tens of millions of crowns on Monday, just the day before the trial.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said legal representative Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay for?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, Slovak representative Milan Ivan or Czech magazine Maria Ličkova.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club paid the city of Prague 10.
The part of the insolvency dispute therefore remains de facto only the claims that Slavie is opposing.
Either according to the club, the liabilities were not incurred at all, or they were subject to legal disputes.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts in case of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove with the statement from the account," said Judge Mládková.
"All that was paid after payment is paid," Mládková said and added that only unliquidated obligations are outstanding or void.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
Then there will be an assessment of all the evidence.
Decisions can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the proceedings on 3 November.
The decision, however, does not come at this meeting, but only in writing after it.
Medals for Finny and Rakus.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of invertor welding sources.
The combination of top technology, hardware and software integrated into modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Whatever, from welding construction steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding rough materials to welding thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, the simple setting and expansion of the welding source allows you to react quickly to the change of requirements, which leads to a reduction of permeability, the need for a change of source and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
It stops wasting time and does not waste material or repair faulty quarrels.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less space, more welding and more profit.
It's this year's news that premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We value these honors very much because they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The leading world producers may boast similar systems, but thanks to the different software and parameters management, FastMig X is one of the world's peaks.
For the interested parties, the delivery deadlines, which move for about three weeks, are certainly pleasant.
We have already established our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years and almost always our business results are better than before him, he stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, manager of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanke went to build it so it wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanke went a little safer, says the expert.
The Blanca Tunnel Complex was able to be built so that there would not be two collapses of land in the Prague Stromovce, claims the manufacturer of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it Wednesday night during a news tour of the tunnel.
But he thought it'd be about half a billion more expensive.
The driver will be opened on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went down safer, but the costs grew exponentially," Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovec were the same all the time, but the country failed just a few steps from where it began to grow safer and more cautiously.
"If the measure had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
Blanca's tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, said the weekly Euro.
The construction was originally intended to cost 17 billion crowns.
When we add VAT, which jumped out twice during the construction, you're twenty-seven billion.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering, valorisation and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer so far away from the 37, he said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

Profits of FedEx mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast for the entire year's profit due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the centre opening.
FedEx says it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite an average increase in interest rates by 4.9 per cent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher charges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher income and growth in online trade.
The chairman of the board and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "played firm performance despite weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in the processing industry and global trade".
Holiday plans were announced the day after the rival company UPS stated that it planned to hire 90 000 to 95,000 extra workers, which is probably the same as they were hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August, 31 FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The share profit was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before FedEx opened, the shares of FedEx decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Tuesday ended with a fall of 11 percent a year and 17 percent under the 11 June record.
At its most expected meeting in years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week at a 27-foot long Honduras mahogany table and decide whether after almost ten years it is time to increase the key interest rate.
On top of them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-storey conference room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should give the nation's economic interests over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Feds have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the American economy is ready to start off when the unprecedented stimulus is suspended in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in the global financial markets could already scare the wary Fed for adding to the instability by increasing its federal fund reference rate - and nothing more than just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piezza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse for not increasing the rate, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if the policy reduces the decline by promising that a further increase is overlooked.
On Tuesday the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed policy will delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their programme statement and hold the financial markets in order to avoid panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slowing down monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that she expected an increase in rates this year, despite complaints from the liberals, over the spring and early summer, that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, this year the labour market saw strong growth.
The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level considered by the Fed to be full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of a pick-up.
And while inflation continues to be below the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed states that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to decline at the end of the last month after China devaluation of its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market kind of bounced off this month, and Dow is now losing almost 10% of May's maximum.
The volatile situation on the market gives the Feds a comprehensive calculation of when to start increasing the interest rate.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the head researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Fed.
Now it predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on regarding the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health state of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be involved in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed has become the currency authority of the entire world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "breathe" their monetary expansion on the market triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected, it can be expected that the Feds are also watching elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of excessive movements in financial markets that seem incompatible with economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making committee of the Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed the increase in rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a 0.75 percentage point reduction in its reference rate during the three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Feds reversed these cuts.
The Fed should take precedence over concerns about financial stability only during the major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting the rate in the Bank of England.
The latest noise does not even come close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets are getting angry," said Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/store is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
Even the car part is available if you need some motor oil.
The shop is massive and it'll take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you are hungry from all this shopping, go to the food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different pick-up points.
What's in the stock: do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large amounts.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - employees at the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free selling semi-finished goods, etc.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Broad alleys come in front of shopping carts and high-rise carts.
Find: Fresh moonong durian next to the treasury stand.
Where is it?The shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and the centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will stay the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
At selected motorway sections it will not be possible to increase under favourable conditions the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h.
On Tuesday, Parliament decided when it joined the Senate's amendment, which rejected an increase in speed.
The new Earth Communications Act is now headed for the president.
President Milos Zeman said by the end of April that a law allowing for a foot-mile speed would be ventilating.
Against the increase was also Minister of Transport Dan Chok (for ANO), according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the law before the Members.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase of speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four-pronged roads.
The House first extended this option to motorways on which it could be driven at selected speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport of the Amendment, also excluded the authorization of the transport police to have the last word in the preparation of the local communications that the municipalities care about.
The Senate version approved by the Parliament also calculates the possibility that sewerage, water pipelines or public lighting cables could be stored at length below the surface of the wagons.
The municipalities would have saved up for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The Novela is also designed to help improve road protection and facilitate the handling of hauled-out vehicles to which owners do not report.
New municipalities could sell hauled vehicles which, within a six-month period following the notification of withdrawal, their owners will not report.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory through the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines for shipping companies as well.
The novel is also hindered by the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of existing paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral exterminator goes to court.
He's been in danger for 10 years for his terrified welcome to the townspeople.
The case concerns the alleged project of welcoming citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute Zuzan Kailova (ČSSD) in this case, but the House of Deputies did not.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both to ten years in prison are at risk.
The main reading is scheduled for two October days.
According to Attorney General Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have been damaged, resulting from the indictment.
The plaintiff is relying on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, have unlawfully allowed the company that organised the citizens' welcome.
According to the indictment, Mandík filed a complaint with the then head of the City Services, Education and Culture Magistrates' Department to address five affiliated companies in the selection proceedings.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the councilman cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges were led to ensure that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the reception of citizens in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and acted in a coordinated manner at least in contravention of the requirement for the proper management procedure, writes the Attorney General.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore subsequently charges Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Citizens' welcome event a price which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company reported more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then the contract went away.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least a million crowns.
Mandík had previously refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-up cause, said the former prime minister earlier, saying that the city under his command only connected to a similar project from the previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, Roxy II provided the event.
"It was under the same conditions, with the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals also originally wanted to accuse Commissioner Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Deputies didn't send her in for prosecution.
Therefore, in her case, criminals have postponed the cause, but they count on Kaill's charge after the parliamentary mandate has ended.
Welcoming the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children’s needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog escape.
Then they got the press to delete the record.
According to the Hungarian police at the border with Serbia, the AP cameraman briefly detained him and forced him to delete a record of a police dog allegedly hitting the fugitive's land.
The Hungarian government, however, questions this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday evening, when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
Police officers stepped against the refugees, and one of them attacked a certain Syrian with a basket on his face.
The dog of the man who screamed "Please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
That Muzi was filming everything, one of the cops noticed and wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist could no longer call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to erase the tape.
Muzi thus lost his two-day job in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a protest letter to the spokesman for the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police in it was considered unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government would destroy the legal material obtained.
Mr. Kovács, with reference to Muzi's police report, questioned the timing of the events.
He said the cops just wanted the press to show them if they're on some footage, which they say they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare off a little, but with certainty they didn't attack," said Kovács.
The unpredictable League of Masters.
Winning the City will kick us, believe Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," he shook Manuel Pellegrini's head, coach of home town.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic League of Masters game.
Not one team has created many opportunities, but the ball on the kicks has been longer than we have.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," Pellegrini, whose team scored in the competition after a long 636 minutes.
The finalist of the past season Juventus was on the opposite side before the collision - after the first three rounds of the Italian league he has the title only point and the score 2:4 is located at the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turn of the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to face the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tedez and Vidal.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mandzukich and Morata were replaced.
"That's right, this victory is very important, so maybe it will bring us a victory wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"We were able to score 0:2 in front of our balancing goal, but Gianluigi held us," praised Allegri's coach, goalman Buffon.
"We burned some good odds," lamented Yayu Touré, the City magazine.
We must take experience from the League of Masters and next try a better outcome.
Good-bye, Angela. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media chatter around is controlled by professionals.
According to media needs, and also upstairs.
So let's stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and media full of children who carry their parents on their hands after the dusty journeys of exodus.
And that causes in a person - that is, in a European person - an automatic sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here desperate babies, notice on the footage of the boats landing on the Greek islands that the baby can't see so much on them!
And recently, images of ships heading for Lampedus, fleeing the French border at Menton, with thousands of young men lying on beautiful promenades, have disappeared from our television.
Most of the young blacks.
And the images from Callais, where these men eat, and the black men wait for them to make it through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think she appreciates it anymore.
Not even those images of the primitive Christian church of Eritrea made a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There's been too much fraud.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of a secret that it's not just poor kids from Syria, it's also stable -- for older people: fashionable -- young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of a gym.
And there's only one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
And out came the young blacks.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all the clothes in branded clothes and shoes. In hand, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested in employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the bearings.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was just in the sea was in bad luck.
They were dressed like American rapper movies.
On the heads of the fingernail cap, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started growing.
They sat around the tables, crowded next to sitting breakfasts and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining room terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming black people drank beer directly from thirds - how in the series from the USA! - they threw empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other loudly.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went to drink wine, too, right out of the bottle.
They jumped into a hotel pool - in brandy swimsuits, especially those young ladies - in the water they were screaming and shouting, mothers and children and pensioners ran away terrifiedly and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the swimming pool.
They're all gone.
Whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, everybody had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had about a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"These are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen how they drink," the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle drugs, they don't use drugs.
They're smuggling something else.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn't that important to me yet.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-corrective policies, as if intellectual and related lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized major force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the August 1968 Moscow television.
Of course, there were some sunflowers at the station, but mainly - the ancient German - Muslims welcomed their fellow Muslims.
For many weeks they have been blabbing on the news on Czech TV as the Germans are said to be almost all for the arrival of immigrants, according to some research.
Of course, who's only been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to receive even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
Of course, what broke out in Germany the next day was that the poll showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people participated in the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel, publicly in November 2010, five years ago, declared: "Our efforts at the 'multi-culti' have completely failed the community."
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coexistence have failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, according to her, there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live beside each other without being integrated.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily with each other, has failed this approach.
He totally failed.
But neither Merkel has the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is rising rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who does not appear to have a degree in the Euro-Parliament - yes, he is the one who Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play the supervisor at the concentration level from minute to minute - he has already shown himself more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last German politicians' statements, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let us note that, to some, most European politicians, these statements are not supported by states that have been victims of Nazism.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Are those who say there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence in Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the efforts of the Magnetics to control the entire centre of Europe with all his power?
When did he say that the big German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Velkonemecka, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxists tried to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the NDR failed, in Germany, for example, based on ecology, which was one of the main ideas of Nazism, new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunny.
German elites have long defended the origin of German nationalism, and so left in peace all those fighters against the atom, eager to seek paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, they fully bowed to the fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped the nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this current there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavan current that considered all Slavs to be difficult vervain - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents' Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threaten the disobedient eastern states, the idea of leader Germany.
Which must be heard without an answer.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And if we involve the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind it as always capital, especially German, which is suited to it and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's countries through banks and the Union.
The sunflower Pseudovar first brought the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism and today brought them home and would bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, seduced by sirens' voices, will soon come across a wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbours with force, again part of its population - but it seems to be a smaller part - ideologically delusional, but eventually reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the coming Islamists erupt?
Will Muslims long live in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans follow up on the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany at all, when the people who will protest loudly and publicly against the new euro superhuman Muslim are raised?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which in Europe has sparked the support of solar ideology, i.e. the ideology of elite and essentially totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the relentless conduct of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the subservient and disobedient eastern neighbours, it cannot go well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders: scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock, and the robust knock goes down on you in a way that the weaker character doesn't just have to stand up.
The lively head will wipe you clean and drive you away, accompanied (or rather driven) by an uninhabited seller and a lively statue.
Perhaps it's a shame that the speaker can't really get one.
We could use a lot of exorcisms and scumbags.
Pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it's between the outer tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansion weeds, but it gives a nice impression on the flowering.
It's between the outer tiles.
She's inquisitive, she's doing well in the garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and unsuspecting.
He's making leaves with a chaotic composition, but it's worth watching and taking pictures.
The beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with a purple escort is just under consideration.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet when breast-feeding
Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to provide women with knowledge of the importance of good nutrition when breast-feeding using images of children sucking from breasts painted with an unwholesome display of food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that deliver to infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only diet measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's trying to take the lead on Today's Show
The involvement of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the costs of escaping liberal leadership has failed to create a sufficient increase for Today.
Nine's morning show, projected from national capital after Malcolm Turnbulla Tony Abbott's down.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armitage stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance to audiences of Aussie TV is so important because it recorded on average 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers of today’s broadcast.
Today saw a slight increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand sea side has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven left a strong 1,136 million viewers, beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed surveillance on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe' said, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped on 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline of the Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets Revealed?...
Lana Yeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have reluctantly found out who's going to win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is covered in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay here will definitely not tell you who the right one is, which eventually gets the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snow White Markoski and Lane Yeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they said thanklessly who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final.
All three women lyrically sang about why Wood is the perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If you don't, who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could function as a spokesman about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Marcoskis quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood apart from them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been having an easy relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sara and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Yeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really an underground woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're fine and comfortable together.
Sarah MacKay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She claims herself that during his last visits at home she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if he didn't eat, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say this," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snow and Lana indecisive.
Bachalor's on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several opportunities to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and many teams asked after his excellent start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which led to the conversion of the Australian rugby league on the first kick from the pitch at Tuesday's win 20:3 on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after hurting Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also still honest in the wardrobe after the game.
Instead of chewing new ones in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and only care about another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught hoping when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 a worse beginning of his career in the NFL he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goalie territory led to the trio of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans holding an Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet in a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovski was arrested at gunpoint on the Siberian range.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovski was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. came to the attention of the emigrants who sought to replace the property.
The two emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple applied for compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The court first awarded them the amount requested, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, the appeal court amended their claim by granting them only less than 90,000 crowns with a reference to the amount of the refund being determined in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The emigrants were held by the Supreme Court, and they were tied to the amount originally sued.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, turned to the US.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the refund granted under the legislation in force at that time - although it was then an adequate refund in relation to the forfeited property - today is only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This can't go to the trouble of side participants as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who haven't had the opportunity to provide a refund before," the judge explained to Jaroslav Fenyk why ÚS took the side of the migrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly stated that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted in favour of legitimate persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the elimination of property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the Studio DVA musical is now being created by Radka Fisharová.
Radka Fišar became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she became the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "Today, Evita's challenge has not been matched by much performance."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monica Absolon recommended her as the first lady of Argentina.
I saw the Monk three times in Evita, and it was certainly inspiring to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite the proponent of more modern modifications, but this one is just being particularly behaved.
"Ondřej Sokola's director is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fischer.
The musical scepter between the two singers will be sent to Monica Absolonová's birthday concert on September 27th from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
Tonight, they're going to finish their songs from Evita's musical.
Experiences will surely include a joint duet of Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Quiet your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also bounce away from the director's desk when he represents Karl Roden as President of Perón during the film.
Due to public interest, additional deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondřej Sokola, Monica Absolon studied the main female role.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and as Che Peter Strenačik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with the Czech texts Michael Prostejovsky sound in the presentation of a live orchestra led by Christopher Mark, who was already involved in the first introduction in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police officers shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber missiles at a crowd of demonstrators against the proposal of a new state constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, says that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and arson bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they went to the rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles known for their ability to kill, but they were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi said they had established a new province under the proposed new constitution and eased their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the creation of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in Kathmandu this week on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of Master Litvinov you couldn't even handle the home duel with the hockey game Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about the same catastrophic entrance to the extraliga as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.
Congratulations, Folke.
NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to have a 60 percent chance of creating a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, probably in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent probability of creating a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecast with its headquarters in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to select $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at selecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries on the run from war-torn and poor countries. Each selected amount of Google will double.
Google has announced this on its blog on a very unusual route.
Google employee Rita Masoud published a report on her blog on the basis of her personal experience when she and her family fled Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled on many dark trains and buses and we were hungry, thirsty, winter and fear," said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like her are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via Google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe faces the greatest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria through a four-year war that has only driven four million people away this year.
Many people also flee from the war fought by Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be useful
The benefits of weight loss for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"Death data takes a long time to be seen," claims Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial in the new study of surgery by JAMA.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the ratio of weight relative to height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values 25 or higher suggests overweight and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital of Min-Sheng in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery decreased according to study 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remains the same for those who have not received surgical treatment for diabetes at approximately 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36% and partially in 28 cases.
In the group of medicines treated, only 1 percent and only 2 percent of patients were fully resolved to compare diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigyllcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the haemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood, reflecting the ongoing level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin value of A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the group of medicines treated, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu's chief researcher and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After five years, the group lost more weight with bypass than the group of gastrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI reductions (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and was more likely to have diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the fall of BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we are waiting too long with the people being exposed to the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you've accumulated these genetic changes that will firmly connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to understand all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of the Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee home countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interest of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even the continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to how to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to the charges against George Bush following the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve the problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used his strength to create unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have experienced a sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres around the United States reported a nearly 400 per cent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgian Toxicology Centre, the number of children under 12 reported on poison control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who must be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink sanitation on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking sanitation because of cheap shouting.
The Nactilists allegedly mixed a sanitary device with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the medium.
"Children don't think that it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitation) are the ones that are perfumed.
To the deposit are sanitary facilities with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several locusts can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Medical Director of the Control Toxicology Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't just let a glass of whiskey get laid, either, but people leave it outside, and when the kids get to it, it's a fast way to drink alcohol.
Nhaiah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently seen up to four locusts of a strawberry-flavored sanitizer at school and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double threshold considered drunkness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke inconspicuous words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell down for alcohol and got hit in the head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaijah.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be available to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation was linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary device containing toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Healthcare professionals thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teachers by placing antibacterial products across the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.
The police considered the misplaced plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No disagreement on the Celtic team
Griffiths is babbling about the controversy in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new January reinforcements will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons raise their head above Celtic by 5 points
The first half Penalta in the administration of ADAM Rooney provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave them a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies rumors of discord
This situation sparked rumors of disagreement in Celtico, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his team members are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're under pressure. I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers magazine and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador to Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about getting the Rangers back.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm's games and not only people in Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things around for good, Deil's committed.
ROONY DALIA mistook Celtic for a little bit, but the Norwegian boss committed himself to turning things around for good.
Malm's defeat and subsequent exit from the League of Masters was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current day.
We're the same way, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support, because it makes the players much better.
Now it's very important to stay close.
Warburton's worried about January reinforcements.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January goals, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the big purchase of reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former chief of Brentford says, "The ice-cold window is very different from the summer."
Players who come in summer have the entire pre-season period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
The cross-border objective of Celticus Micha suggests retirement
Swansea Micha's attacker, who was linked to Celtic in a window of transition, suggested that after the end of his contract with Swansea, he could retire.
A 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with a bent ankle for two years, and he couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent to the dressing room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - it is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths has undertaken to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely punished after admitting that he sang a song with a text directed to former players of Hearts Rudolph Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Rosenburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a ghastly moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can safely say I won't go back to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic's jersey."
The board in Tannadica believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCines is happy for the "ugly victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold on desperately against Hamilton Accesses in order to succeed in winning the seventh league victory after each other and a five-point lead ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of Adam Rooney's application.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged, while UK total unemployment rises
INSTRUMENTS in Scotland remain unchanged in the number of 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK (5.5 per cent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 during a period of three months, and the number of workers now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland dropped to 75.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the British average of 73.5 percent.
State Secretary David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment grew while unemployment declined.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the murder of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery at the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and seeing Richard Glossip executed by a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm afraid of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America and because there are often more requests than vacancies, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a special bond with him over the months of calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just gonna have to remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the behavioral story how he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help counter the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would have made him guilty of co-crime.
But I believe there's a high probability he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that insufficient evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
To that end, you can contact other journalists.
What you'll get from me is the experience of seeing a man I love die a needless death.
The man escaped Canning River after a police chase.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he straightened out the man from Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh running away from the police didn't come out after he got to the shallow mud only meters from a policeman who tried to talk him into coming back to shore.
The Canning Vale police were called in on an incident that went up to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by means of the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I won't go out, just come get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion gives a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins took a car to a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biatlon.
Peter Moody says the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation regarding the Lidar's positive sweep on cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He bit his tongue about the spying charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on this for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it will all come out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"18 months ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint after the question - and offered him employment in my stables for finding information about the things being done in my stables," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in an effort to catch me, they completely burned me down.
Robert Roulston, former RVL President, David Moody, current RVL President, and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, were aware of that and aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and ensure that people outside the training position take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really upsets me.
I'm going to push them, and I'm going to put burdens on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
Coach's frustration levels increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch in it aroused the feeling that "he could have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, the most famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race as "funny" after the horses were applied to their feet by clay cover or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three-month disqualification for the treatment of the covers on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who took off was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after the crash.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy strikes rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the actions of his players as "setting a plan" by two NRL favorites of the prime ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "screw" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly obscured note on Strom after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of the rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy was defending the actions of his players and he said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation raised his confidence because his team is being criticized by two leaders, which could mean they're afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming -- I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we've only been putting emphasis on contact during the operations, and that meant a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which may have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come to this year's part.
Bellamy discredited Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiereship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours. It was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that he thinks is cancelling, especially his young backups with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
That's what he said in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backups like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals fell in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If we're mentioned, it means we'll definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm have this weekend off and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets bail for $200,000 for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life for holding 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled from Queensland received a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men who was arrested last month by the federal police searching for 100 kilos of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and anchored in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting with the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he was facing a potential sentence of life for the possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maximovice made a defense that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in a cafe entirely by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would have escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the court said on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown case.
Mother and stepfather Maximovic jointly offered bail for his release.
"After reading the accompanying statements, it is clear that the $200 000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts themselves were apparently insufficient, for the accused did not go further in court, warning.
Maximovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will comply with the curfew from 18 hours in the evening until 6 a.m.
Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then checked in on her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate pictures of the kids that another user sent him.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing a phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
You passed him, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "concerning" search on the website using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was "to put pedophiles on the Internet" before he "acted as a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was done by him, but he claims he just wanted to pretend that he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked at his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he was doing it to lure them.
He says he got drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shook and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone, and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hog, 23, a resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to an action for the admission or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and did not reach a hearing on 24 March this year.
Attorney General Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sex offenders, because he can argue that in his act there was no "any fundamental sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delinquents before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became virtual in social media.
Parliament's opening was also marred by statements by opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats of murder, which warned them against Mr Mugabe's writing during his speech.
Last month he was fired and provoked during his speech about the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the MP's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to defend Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but is called 'death'," said journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It cautions the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and once it comes out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has a "oboe" about threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancellation of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services to the company.
Later this year, HP will split into two companies listed on the stock exchange and separate the trade in computers and printers from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the board, who will head the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops that will help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion per year after the company's statement and will "focus on providing uncompetitive integrated technological solutions" to companies.
This will mean the distribution of a company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP went through a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest of this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain Michael Artet says the teammates must get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there's no reason he won't play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next summer European championship is clearly uncertain.
The great damage to this most recent problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after wounding his ankle and then regained his former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger claims.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the wound he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant formula here.
The survey carried out by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the last five years, he has played only 65 league matches in the Arsenal of the total 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal, this means that in the sixth of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two clubs of the Premier League, which lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger claims.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Lize champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb match with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Artet will probably take off.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Walcott.
“I try to maintain balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite of the F group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation for the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after the "insurmountable" campaign last season.
The stadium shook at the middle of the night with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit [3.2 ° C].
That was the tenth year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal has learned from the last season of the Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco, and he has a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This setting is enormous," Wenger claims.
The arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar displays in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever about suicides among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013 it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured one had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood", their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends is a half chance of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not the content of communications, the immediate answer is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker explained recently, money doesn't really buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of that thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that radiated through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the sources of knowing that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."My role as listeners of people who feel depressed or suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will rise in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He highlights little moments in male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater proximity, from a network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you're going to FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central Station, why don't you take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edison Cavan after shooting the goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in Lize Masters and helped PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey to Lize Masters with a final comfortable victory 2-0 against Malmo on Parc des Princess.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after her debut in the Lize Masters and this PSG player sent French champions after winning, but then threw away a few chances until they finally raised their headline when Cavannis shot the goal with his head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on qualifying for the laps, but on improving their trip to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In Lize Masters it is not easy to win out and home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents problems and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the season's process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes of the PSG team, which at home spent this weekend of the 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was shaded by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after crossing from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran onto Marc Verratti's passport to defend Malm and with a beautiful ending, he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the distant corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to trigger a grand victory of the PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in playoffs and got to this stage, took place with nine internationals in the basic composition and five defenders and two pulled backers were a tough opponent.
But apart from the shooting of Nikola Durdjice, who just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad performances and a miserable ending, which was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot came into the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavanaugh.
However, he proved much more suitable when he came to prepare a chance for his teammates, and it was precisely from his performance when Di Maria sent a swing shot that ended in Wiland's gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan head sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played it from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make a difference in the game, and only Wiland's excellent move from a great close to the hope of David Louise and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the rotating Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The team coach Malmo Age Hareide admitted that the PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in Lize Masters took place last December."
Since then, we've only played Swedish leagues that aren't on the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The weighting giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
This company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is facing commodity price fluctuations, as China's slowdown reduces demand and sparks destruction across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pennies on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent above.
Glencore discovered last week that the sale of $2.5 billion shares is part of broader plans to reduce their debt by $30 billion, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pennies per share, which was a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares in the total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on 25 September in Barack Obama's reaction to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his though Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity to strengthen the relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with controversial problems, including Washington's fear of China's alleged cyberspionage and its increasing aggression in the South China Sea waters.
How the refugee crisis scattered the Schengen area.
The emergency lights set off by Germany did not darken the European crew, but they are already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
On Monday, the European Union decided to deal with the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters the old continent - especially Greece - than to argue over the future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of quantities that are getting further away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of refugees, it is necessary to filter out those who are already arriving today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday stressed.
After the crisis, the common currency is found to be at risk by the EU in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increase its pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
Central power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement is possible in Europe.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with different intensity.
Hungary has come into this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
That it's a dominant effect, but it's also seen by the blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone to the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new at all, but it is being implemented with a stiffness.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others so that its thighs will not contain camps in which refugees will accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after having passed crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge yawn hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil, waiting for a new government, has put its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan road and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it did not specify any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece relate to the whole of Europe," the EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum reception capacities and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athena.
The issue of the creation of real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the eighty-two, as well as the second round, raised the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was strongly supported by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the duty, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the eighties.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during the EU's hectic summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, three of them supposedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who survived as one of the eight-member groups affected.
Previous media reports say it's Polk.
Some 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur area.
According to the AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue action is over, and the victims' bodies have also been transferred to Briancon for identification," said the prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The accident took place around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area under the top of Mount Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a metre high," noted the head of rescue workers Nicolas Colombani.
According to the eight - member group, about 1,900 feet [3,900 m] of snow fell.
Meteorology today did not warn in the area of adverse weather.
Trpišovský before the match with Brago: Finally a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his cup premiere, was able to cross the European League into the main group with the Liberce football players, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The words for the introduction of the main stage of the competition welcome the 2011 finalist Bragu and according to the coach wants to force her game style.
After all the nerve in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could shut you down on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've got, we can play our tactics, and we're not tied up with just a two-band.
"I look forward to it and it is a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovski said at a press conference.
Bragu thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult now that he doesn't have a name like that, but he has a player in his cadre who I think had three goals for Manchester.
"It is an excellent whole at top team level," said Trpišovský.
He doesn't consider Bragu to be a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think that we have shown that we are strong at our stadium in both our home competition and in our classrooms, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost eleven duels this season only the opening Supercup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can even force his style.
We've got a team waiting to be strong on the ball, and at the same time it's untypically disciplined for them.
They're playing from the 4-4-2 deployment with a rapid transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, though we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
We studied a lot of competitors in the suburbs, which has helped us a lot, and this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to practice.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films will rule Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works this year to the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Sand.
Four dozen of them, which the commission of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from October 15th to October 18th in Portyč cinema.
The best of them will choose an international jury, said the spokesman for the Jakub Charvat festival.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which unfolds from the festival sound.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year's celebrations, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to connect the elements of television, film and theatre works.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime committed in our retreat this year," said Charvat.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting of student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include, for example, the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers, like every year, are preparing an accompanying programme.
The Vatican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player at didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, Turbosanson group will fly?, play band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will bring a graduate of the Sand Film School and the recipient of prestigious awards, among which there is no shortage of this from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The German film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber with music by cameraman and documentary documentary documentary Martin Čech, and the sand natives of Brukner, Novotná and Hlach will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Sand, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common links, as well as a film craft," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several work auditions at once and thus get a job position.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher School of Film in Sand.
Her founders, husbands Vladan and Miloň Terčov, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
When CK falls, insurance companies have to pay the full amount of clients' claims.
Insurance companies should pay client entitlements when the travel agency falls in full.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House when it approved an amended amendment to the law on terms and conditions of tourism business.
The travel agencies will be able to replace the insurance against the bankruptcy of the bank guarantee according to a template to be assessed in the Senate.
Insurance undertakings with the obligation to pay for the rights of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is in the process of adjusting, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against collapse when the amendment pays.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll have to either end up or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karla Šlechtová (for ANO), pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not Euro-comfortary.
It drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund of the money regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Schlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee won't work under him because no one will give it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The Presidium member of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey between the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The comments of the insurance companies do not consider Okamura relevant, no official written comments in this sense exist in that respect.
They say, however, that travel agencies will form a partnership, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Before the provision, Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and her foreign counterpart Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs by Czech travel agencies.
Fischer's travel agencies won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her proposal to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KČM) did not come with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of alleged contradiction with the civil code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies that he believed could endanger consumers.
In view of the Constitutional Court’s ruling, the rapporteur for the proposal, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agencies offering air travel tours and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 per cent of planned sales from the sale of the tours.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such that, in the event of a loss, the travel agency will cover all the customer's claims.
The standard, even after the modifications, provides that travel agencies will have to re-design the travel agency of the tour for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit information on the management and number of trips to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract.
The approved amendment to the Committee on Public Administration shall also count on further regular information to be provided to insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to provide data each month on the number of passengers and sold tours, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advance and sales for the tours and their vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations vis-à-vis the insurance undertaking, it shall call upon it, in accordance with the correction proposal, or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of the customers.
Novela is also scheduled to reorganise the financing of mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, the financial plan of expenditure and the outlook for the next two years.
According to the Association, however, the drafter of the law did not understand what would happen if the insurance company denounced the CK contract.
This can't be organized, and the clients who bought the trip before the insurance was cancelled will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even fail, although its management was in good condition.
One option of how travel agencies can settle such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and make use of much softer conditions abroad and on our market then we will act only as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Association Jan Pope.
Although the proposal of the amendment also contains a bank guarantee institution, it is so reckless that it cannot be implemented in practice, since the bank guarantee cannot be made to an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change in existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
Over the next two years, the whole law will have to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs ceased their operations.
Domestic travel agencies sell annual tours worth about 20 billion CZK.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be set up to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced it after dealing with the German Earth premieres.
At the same time, she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the member states of the Twenty-eight.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are delayed after leaving their country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will meet on decent terms in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which more financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations could be such a signal.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis in European countries," Merkel said.
Earth Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this connection at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas is rejected in the long term by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke for speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start the integration of foreigners more quickly, said the Armoured Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends in the care of the runners be used to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to get the refugees to master German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runner manages to integrate, they can become a contribution to us, he said.
Matt Damon bagatellissing the film's division
Matt Damon confronted Effie Brown, an aphro-ametic filmmaker, during a debate on diversification, claiming that it was not necessary behind scenes.
During Sunday's HBO episode, Greenlight interrupted an actor in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversification, you do it by casting a film and not by hosting a show,” says Damon.
Shocked, she reacted badly to Brown with mistrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown brought together a well-known producer, Ben Affleck, and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think whether the director is anyone, how they will behave towards the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character who's a hooker packed by a white pimp.
The producer of the Precious White People advocated the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon cut off that their director "so she could finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the video, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Tweet has gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is ahead of social debate.
After being killed by a teenage Michael Brown white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took on a national effect and pushed law makers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made advances on the movement, while listing the nominated in the category Album of the Year during the transmission of the Grammy prices.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the album is still important.
The latest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leader declared.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope, it is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional climber and piccolic Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition that had just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final season, two men fought to the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of slough after more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first in the set limit and became the first contestant to win in the American Ninja Warrior 4th section, but Caldiero beat him by three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the news! News immediately after his hard-earned victory and was aware that he was still in shock at winning the $1 million main price.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to my winnings.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten won no reward even though he became the first competitor to finish the line.
According to the rules, money belongs to the person who finishes the line as fast as possible.
"If more competitors participate in the track, the winner will win with the best time," Weed said.
Even though the profit of the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd have any resentment in him.
He's glad he could do what he could.
He got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me: “If there was to be someone who could have defeated me, I’m glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only went right around Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk in the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the final place of the Central Division of the American League.
They only narrowly turned back their defeat when they beat Minnesota in Tuesday's match with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium.
The twins lost their chance to get close to Houston Astros and grab a second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which to them during the second half of the season was so elusive.
"To win is always fun and it doesn't matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive appearance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another one in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the launches and 3 rounds.
It was just his third play of the last nine games.
"This year I want to end with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a game when you're often sitting on a bench and that's why I want to get in the game."
Tiger champion Victor Martinez scored three times and made two rounds and his first download point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game, where he scored four times in the Battle of Seattle Mariners.
"He's got a lot on his plate," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in practice, fired a lot better and managed to get it into the game."
Thanks to three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins won the greatest chance of getting back in the game.
The middle polar Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right polar Aaron Hicks won a point thanks to a set bat and Simon insisted on Brian Dozier before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy shut down his only rival, Mauer, and before him he had a Miguel Sana, a gunman who fired a ball and circled two goals and left right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the goals and chances of a second shift, VerHage managed to send the third metre over two meths.
Plouffe has already won 27 runs over two goals in this season and reigns a league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two downloaded points and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man shut down Sana for three events.
Detroit took advantage and scored Phil Hughes.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against a well-earned right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month’s break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” said Hughes, “but during the third shift I felt I was doing better.
After resisting the first shift, Hughes released one point to the second meter to Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar J.D. Martinez took out Victor Martinez, who first circled all the targets.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third metre Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the court and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was transferred when he tried to reach the third target.
The tigers added in the second shift when the pitcher James McCann and the polar Anthony Gose won two and towed one point and the score 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"It got us to our knees," said the manager of the Twin Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in third shift without points and replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes made three rounds, got six rounds and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a true tiger pitcher, ended the game with pain in his right shoulder.
He's going to be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the list of injured by the stretchy muscles in his arms since mid-August, should be in the middle match.
Sanchez will replace left-handed Daniel Norris, who will come back after the injury and take action against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left pitcher, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
Since August 20, however, he has not yet played for his muscle.
The Tigers and the Twins will play the third mutual game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Anti-Noris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is built the Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of an economy into a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to the group whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," the Central Steering Group said on the 16th meeting to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of opening up in emerging reforms will provide a new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SEEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, states the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or a "green card" by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The right of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and a public prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, there may be a new Bedroom.
According to Hejtman of the Karlovy Vary Region of Jakub Panik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities for extended care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department, one-day surgery centres could be established where, according to the established concept, the performances of surgical fields that do not require hospitalisation would be carried out for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on day-to-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
A laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin disease could be set up in Karlova Vary’s skin ward.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic centre to care for patients with brain disease who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of focusing such equipment on the island hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is the bed of subsequent care, in particular the bed of the Long-Term Hospital Treatment (LDN), whose capacity in Najdek is insufficient and in particular should be closely linked to the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the beds of subsequent care are mainly missing at Karlova Vary Hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are social beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are insufficient throughout the Republic and could therefore serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer’s Centre.
As recommended, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds for which funding for European grants will be released.
"These are the beds that will follow the disciplines of subspecialized care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery for example after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
