Republic strategy for resistance to re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat counterfeiting in the elections.
At the Brennan Centre, however, the latter is considered a myth, claiming that counterfeiting in elections in the United States is less frequent than lightning deaths.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of elective counterfeiting in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have adopted laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon was re-emerged after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were adopted in one year.
The new electoral laws require the electorate to present a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to vote on the day of the vote and deprive citizens of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had obliged voters to present a photo identification.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend this practice to other states.
During the last two years, they have initiated legislation that obliges voters to present identity cards with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity card with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are believed to vote for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo identification card issued by their educational institution.
However, these states permit members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American nationality for voting.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at restricting the voting of Latin American nationals.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This limitation has not gone without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of voters who voted early were African-Americans, although the latter were only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin American citizens.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, which, by forming 76 per cent of voters, were only 46 per cent of voters in the short term.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were promised by democratic governors.
The effects of the most ambiguous laws were suspended when the United States Attorney General intervened.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the identification of a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that had entered into force would certainly make it difficult to exercise electoral law in the 2012 elections.
Critics of Democrats condemn the biases of the laws that have been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Centre of Brennan shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
A screening of the cancer of the pleural gland: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, false, and sometimes false positive results that lead to useless medical interventions.
Men, and so reluctant to be dissipated, have more reason to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have found many cases of infection among study groups, and data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to come up with any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, revealed different levels of mortality among those who had received screening and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastases occurring is 30-40 per cent higher for those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend that you take a 50-year-old test or 40-year-old test if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at higher risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and pervasive.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer by offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk of life, but by making a choice, in these cases, in favour of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
We increasingly define the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not this test is necessary.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess everything in favour and against the passing of the test on the PAS.

Prevent the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented if all human beings ate well and moved enough.
“If no one smoked any more, this figure would have increased to at least 50 per cent”, stressed André Bolje, secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It does tremendous harm to the health of the people.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” says press secretary André Bolje.
It is encouraging to note that the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half after 10 years of smoking.
Wes
According to CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and straight intestines, food supply, stomach and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer”, added the Association.
Food
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of developing colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by pressing, drying or salsa may result in the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter may harm the body’s cells and cause cancer,” explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But to date, the results of these studies cannot be described as unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other was the opposite.
There is also no complete clarity in the impact assessment of vitamin D cancer.
However, Mr. Boljo stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in detail
Last summer, reports that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real exaggeration, not without justification.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle that was predicted to exist in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, “the least imperfect” description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which was previously not found in an experimental way.
But physicists aren't quite sure it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very much like the Higgs boson foretold in the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine what the Higgs boson is, because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is completely inevitable, stating that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to get past this rule, not even try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it also turns out that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of Paula's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quant state” is “state” in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Hence, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good-natured citizens called farmes, who wisely obey Paula's principle.
In another, there are bosons, a loathsome gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything — at least that principle — that means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (in fact, quite unusual) the article Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided into two groups: the ones we're not going to talk about here, and the “particles of force” that are the main forces of nature, and some of them are Higgs bosons.
These very bosons should be emphasized, not all of them are exotic beings, as you might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of the light", which is the "courier" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a spring.
This “disruption” gives birth to an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon, and therefore one of the bosons of the “power carrier”.
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the difference that the boson must have been “broken” by another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, such as the one used in the CERN, the Great Adrienne Collider, which is a 27-km ring! - to achieve such enormous energy.
The similarity with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, and others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never hold on to a refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have a mass, while others (such as photon, by the way) do not have one.
So, what can all these studies bring, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to distinguish between observations and projections of the MM.
In addition, some of them are passionate about finding such a difference, since the slightest discrepancy can open the door for “new physics” and shut some of the gaps in the Model.
The latter, to be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But until such time, such differences were found in the CERN.
Consequences
It would be more difficult to predict the benefits of these studies for the average person's daily life, but it would be a mistake to assume that he is not.
See, at the beginning of the 1960 ’ s, pioneers in laser research at Bell’s laboratories could not even guess what revolution their work would be like.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, already a late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (formerly impulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered as a “laboratory gadget”.
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his research in 1969.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, is now an eye for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the work of the Great Adront Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows that everything can happen.
Palliative aid is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec had recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debates should soon resume, and a bill is being drafted at that time.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Long tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer that destroyed it from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in Victor-Gadbua's home of palliative care in Belay, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom and even eating yourself.
Sitting at a table with an appetizing meal, he gives up and agrees to help him take food.
He wakes up, even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In life we are taught that a man should pee on a stand," says Pierre Broder, psychologist at Victor-Gadbou's shelter.
Regressing to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to accept the decline, he claims.
Because many people who are involved in palliative care believe that important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Prognosis gives them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing assistance called “medical treatment”.
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die consciously of strangulation.
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put on a mask that makes her breathe easier.
She is still waiting for her son to arrive from Italy in the coming days.
A group of volunteers are providing body care and food assistance at the Victor Gadbua shelter.
That is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 inhabitants have one seat in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
The dying one, we'll agree to give mouthwash from brandy or pepsi, even if he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son drank that beer in the deceased's legs.
“We help our loved ones as well as our patients, ” says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
There's not a single day in Victor Gadbua's shelter that looks like the last.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last encounter with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a young man dies tragically 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children, and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months from three to five beds, they've always been engaged in cancer patients under 45 years of age," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbou's shelter came from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is considered that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Society of the Greater Montreal Home, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec ' s health system that makes many doctors who are qualified for palliative care afraid to adopt legislation that legalizes euthanasia and help them commit suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto signed by the lights in the area of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, indicating their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec ' s health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to make them easier.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients until the last day despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard’s hopes for survival were already minimal when she stopped her exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she told me she was sorry that I was quitting the fight, she said.
At the same time, she told me that my days were considered!
There's no such thing as an all-powerful retreat.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the people who ask for death are due to medical personnel for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not entirely powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal House, patients are not susceptible to 8 percent of the cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient sleeps until the moment he dies, either from time to time or permanently.
We can't pretend any more that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Sick people who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized," it means "I want to be relieved."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists day after day tell of what they know about the colossal “system” that encroachs on the construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
The “Industry”, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how this system breaks down after all the funds have been released, Jacques Ducheno, deputy and former chief of police of Montreal is joking."
It was because of him that there was a scandal in 2011 as a side effect of the investigation of the road construction offences in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of the time of the Liberals, Jean Sharé, was very reluctant to accept.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he has stressed that the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts”, if some had held back their instincts to take part.
The Charbonno Commission “has already moved two mayors”, he added, hoping that it would be able to “cover up the schemes behind individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The 2011 Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts, was involved.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molot, which had forced the Montreal East Cartel since 2009, to stop the excess of the value of contracts.
A series of searches has been conducted over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Vayankour, recently retired mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving bribes on a number of occasions during the posting of government orders.
In addition, the official indictment was made available to several Montreal communications engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accuro and Lino Zambito.
The latter blew up the real bomb by investigating the “system” of government contracts.
For several years, Zambito paid 3 per cent of the cost of contracts concluded in Montreal to a mob mediator who, in turn, transferred the money of Mayor Gerald Tramble's party to the United Montreal.
During the 2000s, Zambito spent money on the right and left; he credited more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parts of the province, mostly liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Sewer contracts in which value has been increased
In Montreal, the system of corruption worked without fail.
In ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts that he had raised.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they had received an increase of 30 to 40 per cent through false additions.
A party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to kill an alarm.
The mayor of the Rivier de Prairie district in the east of the island, has been opposed to the sale since 2010 of a municipality purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million builders in the midst of a construction boom.
70 per cent of the dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would eventually be initiated, she would “restraint behind a thread that would enable the ants to understand the functioning of the system to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized as “painful but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
We're going home.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Ducheno notes, for his part, that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the schemes.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the Quebec electoral campaign was 70 per cent, he joked: “I was told that it was only a vague reflection of reality.”
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 in donations to parties, but he said this would not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the public contracts system and the financing of parties: “We cannot go down below; we have boldly entered into things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy”.
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PJ - not FK Barcelona!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary height in the FGM.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be by a new dimension of the FGM.
Big players are here.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a great deal.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not getting hot.
From the very beginning in the pre-training centre at the Klerfonten NIF, and until my arrival in St. Etienne, I have always moved forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition that Carlo Anchelotti...
This summer's not a new high-level game.
They also know that each exercise is very important.
This leads a player like me to want to be on the level and be taught as much as possible.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti supports my position.
He's been assisted by deputies like Claude McElele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancholotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancholotti honors all technical staff.
Today, the First League has no equal and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from the whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the First League, Leon took the lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified for one eighth of the finals.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
First, we want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take back the match in one eighth of the finals.
Can the FGM become a top-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure long-term positions.
That's not true today.
Financially, PWF has the means to make this project real.
Not taking a title in the First League like last season is going to be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had everything to get to finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Leon and Bordeaux have joined the title fight, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the PJ?
It's normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and how many players we have.
We're totally ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Tru, and we're still being found to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what people expect from us first.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We're not Barcelona's FK!
We're trying to put in a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, whose two seasons have failed in one eighth of the finals, although they have also spent huge money!
Given the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and the French champion.
Leon and Marcel, who weren't at high last season, were "waked" by this new PIC.
This shows how appealing the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PIC seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's exploits.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "Golden Addiction."
This only means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he is killing many heads.
He came for it, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and star of the world.
In the group, we respect him as a human being and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This stimulates others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro-2012 with the Companion of France?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate very much in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting some time playing games.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I've come out of there stronger.
Today I'm able to play a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to behave exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Didi Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're effective for him.
He's got a good position on the world championship team.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he inspires us to win.
What was Laurent Blan like?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1) ripped out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match has given us faith in itself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had no matches like this.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The total opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens to these technologies, it is clear that a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, an invented Satoshi Nakamoto (alias), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept battle stations for donations or as a means of payment.
At a maximum of 30 Euros (23 Euros) in June 2011, five months later, the bitcoincharts.com had dropped to $2 before returning today to about ten dollars.
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competiting with a dollar or a euro” and “like ordinary currencies”.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as credits used to advance video games that are earned in the game process or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are held simultaneously by accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mails, like e-mails.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it can be verified that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent all over the network.
A key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent out to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. turning a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before they're able to keep it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus results in an unbreakable link to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user wished to pay twice with the same money (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that did the job gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly distributed in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided into one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing as the computing capacity increases.
The life of the network has already survived the ups and downs.
Bitcoin sites were under attack and battle stations were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paimium, a company that makes payments with real money using Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress’s blog platform, are allowed.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and discovered that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
Giant Sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmkvist, who works in Coinabul to convert Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency manual, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just give us an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by telephone, says Pierre Nuaz, saying that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in the revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, in its report, envisages reviewing the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of the success of the system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We were mainly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we considered to be terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, let jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West becomes more sensitive.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was fine.
Truck convoys and armoured personnel escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances changed from the time of their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, in which they were overrun by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mojaheds, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to hold women in subjection.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become traffickers taking over state lands to resell them to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave when those who have experienced American generosity will leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders must be ensured.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who watch everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will command her be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who led the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, following the example of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the '50s, and even before, depends on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country devastated by the thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has vast mineral resources.
It only increased the feeling that Western countries were there just to conquer them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the birthplace of Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a vast Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that, on one beautiful day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French military units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: a face for girls, boys, a French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “encourage hearts and minds” and to achieve the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military civil action” service at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, have helped to halt the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and land expansion.
What will we keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work based on local communities in Capisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings run by foreign groups, as farmers have told me, it is necessary to provide them with a small non-military support that is well controlled and direct to them.
Heavy births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Mursey's new risky move.
While Egypt was more divided than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, he decided to play the va-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Soon, as Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the separation of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusion”, continuing “infringing the word” and “contravening the law”.
His followers were convinced that this was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that causes the brothers to give up the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsey seems confident that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people, “either you vote in favour of my text or I retain extraordinary powers”, which are expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their views.
Representatives of defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 reserve participants were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
No wonder the articles were voted unanimously in most cases.
The commentators, by the way, were distracted by the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been misconstrued.
The text on which there was still a vote yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 was ultimately an identical article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to be applied more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
Hypocrisy is the answer of liberals who only see a pear in it.
Because they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which provides the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular with regard to verification of the conformity of sharia laws.
According to Egypt's expert, Sophie Pomier, this is disturbing, namely, “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can see the origin of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain in civil law.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulems, but people with university education have been trained in the French system," said Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “in the context of article 220 there may be ambiguities, since the terms used therein are derived from religious language.
This applies, in particular, to “fix” [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how many civilian judges are competent to make decisions on this matter.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad authority to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have fallen considerably in comparison with what they were under the old regime.
Another issue: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not take place in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles referred to the protection of women, notes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak on television last night, the event is scheduled for this afternoon.
Members of the Head of State will, in turn, take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, a Pup Earth and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the splendor of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the perfection of nature.
Aif has identified five of the most important reasons why we should go to Israel.
Worshiping Sacred Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this “buyer ” will be reduced by God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: the turning of the marriage of the water into wine, the walking of the water, the calming of the storm, and the filling of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most sacred place in Jerusalem.
Believers here go through the Path of Jesus ’ tribulation or the Cross Road (Latin: Via Dolores).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia Pretoriaum, where there was judgment, and in the streets of the Old Town brings the Lord's Temple to the mountain of Golgophe, to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing, and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pup of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected at a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was grown from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem also has the most sacred place for the Jews, Stan Placha, who remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave notes with desires that are then fulfilled.
Take a Walk Through the Vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on the rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who take part in mountaineering can reach them.
The rest are brought to this historic summit by a cableway lift.
In the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon mountain resort at 1600-2040 metres, where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
From the foot of the mountain, a shuttle bus takes him.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountains.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are some 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, should visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located not far from the Knesset.
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
There's an art museum in Tel Aviv.
Its exhibition features an impressive painting of Moné, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanna, Sisleya, Matisse, Modillani, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is a few halls of old Turkish baths with visitors and bankers at the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Rally Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir benches.
Access is free and donations are not received categorically.
The fifth is the Holocaust Museum or the Jad Vashem Museum in Tel Aviv, which describes one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children ' s memorial, was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
You'll get better.
The three main resort areas of Israel are on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, even during winter months, the temperature of the water does not drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, and it bathes for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below ocean level.
The laser water in it is a solvent that can easily keep swimming even when it is not able to swim.
The landscapes are unreally beautiful.
They're coming here to take a salt water treatment course -- raps, and purposeful dirt, and treat the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus to get the nerves going.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it came the famous Maritime Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
It was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of the narrow streets named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna will be favorably favored.
Young men from all over Israel and even other countries can be found in Jaffa at the photo session.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can cross the Roman theater, take the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarius was the capital city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The well-restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Visitor to the Note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population knows Russian.
Travel money is better taken, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but there is a tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only subway in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower Town to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funnikler.
All forms of urban transport cost 6 shekels for which you can drive with transplants for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, Sabbaths are observed in Jewish tradition on Saturday.
From Friday evening till sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation cease to work.
On Sunday morning, a working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher food that excludes pork, seafood, Czech fish, and meat are mixed with milk.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared for coconut milk, traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, mint balls, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fat cats who are "walking on their own."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The murals love people's places and don't give up their treats.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
And a bike ride is going to cost 15 check a day.
Tickets in the museum average 30 shekels.
Numeric Language
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from around the world.
The United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine most visited and rested.
A total of 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51 per cent more than the 2010 figure, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Big and powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants dig money into language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that they will pass a mandatory language testing law, there have already been frauds in the country that trade in “leak” certificates
Every year, 13 million gastrobytes arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left behind.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force that every migrant worker will be required to pass an examination for Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing, housing, housing and retail trade.
In time, however, - promised in the FMC - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Not only the language but also the Russian history and the basis of the legislation will have to be given up.
Knowledge of language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend work permits.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is a national language.
The law does not apply and people who obtained certificates and diplomas of education prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefits, consecration and protection of rights
The Network of Examination Points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, IHL, SPBSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by both the Gosduma deputies and the FMC.
And these human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press many times: What is this going to do?
What will change the obligation to speak both for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service is responsible, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian FMS Mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
The problems arise from migrants without a profession, education that does not have a language without a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev is confident that the future migrant is destined to face unethical people who, by means of help, will put him in a yellow, narrow barracks, where he and dozens of such ones will be lurking for months without food and documents, injecting 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one at home, and they are deceived upon their arrival, taken from their passports, not paid the promised salary," said the Chief of the Directorate-General for Labour Migration, Ms. Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, hillbilly!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics are seeking to earn money in Russia, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country they seek but they also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, it's not as much their fault as it is their trouble: few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even more basic education.
Their families do not even have to feed their children, let alone dress them well, dress them, and equip them for school.
As they reach their teens, they are going to work at the earliest opportunity.
It's hard if you don't know the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders, there is one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or formal work.
In the meantime, most of the Gastarbiters still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or the Foreigner is forbidden"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is the bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 rubles.
And here's a fake registration that can be done quickly and only in one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, no extortion cases.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," said Tajikistan's citizen Umed Khuskadamov.
"Fly, don't focus, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “stick” certificates for language tests have already been removed by FMC staff.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they had not been able to afford new owners, each of the migrants who had hoped to make it easier to pass the tests had paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
This is twice the cost of official testing: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand dollars.
The main challenge is to protect the system from corruption in the near future, so that the “steps” cannot simply be bought, the authorities and human rights defenders meet.
While the authorities can promise those who have failed to pass the test for the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not trading in the illegal arms market.
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To fire on weddings when there were no casualties and a massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the use of trauma in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption of Corruption, Irina Jarovaj, and promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be made to Gosduma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "twisting the hooks".
There was an open letter on the web, the authors of which, representatives of various social small organizations, demand that “insane tightening” be waived.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian Service of the BBC criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 firearms crimes have been committed in six months 2012, while 1,168 000 crimes have been recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil arms legislation does not place the offender in the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The "black" arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired Colonel Victor Baranec, who has worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Genstab.
Screenshot of the gun-taking site
The first is an army or military trail, a weapon that was stolen during hostilities in the Caucasus.
“Arms were carried by both Russian officers and Caucasians themselves,” says the Baran.
The next type of "black weapons" is stolen by criminals from the forces.
The Ombudsman explains that this includes police-deposited and directly stolen law enforcement personnel.
Illegal "boilers" are leaving the military warehouses for sale.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that part of the fires were made specifically to cover up the shortage," says the former military.
According to the Barantz, the producers of weapons are making their contribution.
“At present, private arms factories are being produced, which are not competitive in the international market and are dumping weapons from the fields into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Guns and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are particularly common.
"There is its production, sometimes artisanal, and there is a mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each source of illicit arms transfers to the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
The experts reviewed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminological literature and the open data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and from the forces.
Half the arms in the black market were “guilty to officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report said.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent from weapons-produced theft, and 5 per cent from “black archaeology”.
An arms dealer who asked not to name his name assures us that the weapons found by black diggers have not been purchased in a long time, too old.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers go to the military warehouse for a new party.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's getting it out, he's getting it passed over to him through the rectum.
"He takes her to town and sells 900 euros for a two-store thing," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the crime detection plan is on fire, they conduct a verification purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons”, the consultant adds.
"How's the fancy store?"
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a friend who offered to come to the Behova platform, where there's going to be a person who's going to take me to the corner where we're going to trade.
That's the only place I knew the price of the gun.
Military observer Victor Baranez
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out.
There are salesmen in the markets, but there is also a need to come, on condition, from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell his daughter that the tooth fell out.
I'm getting a few castes now through someone I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me because he knows I'm not giving them up.
Newbies are looking for guns in different ways.
Former military soldier Victor Baranets tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on this.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos of "anything."
"I felt like I was in a fancy store," remembers the military.
The buyer, according to the Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - anything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy-- we go with a salesman into the woods, we put a target there.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are good, we start trading," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Internet search engines put in Web sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons “for different purposes”.
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.

In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets
Working on the McDonald's register brings up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universities and restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Until no one dares to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or is destined to be exhaled in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries of regular Walmart workers and the fast food system, the purpose of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
So far, this sector of the economy is barely covered by trade union movements.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when an orgy of cheap sales attacked America, captured millions of invaders and sometimes accompanied by pranks.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who worldwide employ 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picked up with trade unions and left-wing activists the stores of a corporation whose goods are based on people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the light, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to forests, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average between 8 per cent and 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only charged at work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods to the traveller partly because he pays his employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of motor loaders or manual scanners.
Shareholders on "Black Friday" demanded a raise in wages and netted that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 an hour, that's not on his pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost a corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages right now.
If Walmart completely shifts the salary growth on the hands of the buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
The Walmart party is quite aware that the protests took place only in nine states and did not cause any minor damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued in her stores from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of the corporation, claimed in an interview with Huffington Post's left-hand site that jobs had left a total of “less than five” Walmart staff, and that the protest was merely another “piarist trick” organized by her trade union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart University (they are not mourned in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but by McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of rations, and then he doesn't even give you hospital bills or pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, New York High Council member
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants have been increasing it over time, but little, and on average their regular employees are getting $8.90 an hour in New York City.
There's no one in this expensive town who earns less.
How you can be in New York for that kind of money, it's impossible for me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their benches after school lived with their parents.
Few people have seen the main source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly confronted with interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal Forum has a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
The American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with bullying and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult for the union to reach fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main issues is the unusual turnover of staff.
Disagreements
The noisy protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The stake culminated in the middle of the day's rally at McDonald's, near the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, in particular a member of the Mountain Council of Jumaine Williams, who said: "Macdonalds" says he sells billions of rations, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the demonstrators, such as the mayoral candidate Bill De Blacio, who stated that "we must join in supporting fast-food workers in order to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being each New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described, it was the largest such action in the history of American fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were workers of a rapid general inquiry, which included tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to the flames of mass traffic.
"As long as you fool your brain, you get the average."
The recent topic of complementary reality that is popular among fans of modern technology has been taken mainly through the prism of special points.
At its annual conference, the current model showed Google first in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the relevant patent.
However, a conversation with the leader of an interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Izadi, shows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are a stage taken.
They have the prospect of being manipulated by virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Please tell me, in general, what is your research team doing?
- We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to extend the boundaries of that interaction.
As long as mankind in the mass is stuck at the point of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes with their fingertips.
We want to take a look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everybody is interested in sign management.
- What else is ahead?
- Although Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do so, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, damn these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but aren't they overestimating it?
- It certainly cannot be called a panic - it raises a question of privacy because it does not always want to inform others of its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about crafty ones, but about such expensive, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken, not by camera, but by hand bracelet, which fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to hand hours.
But in general, the future of a mixed type of governance, for example, a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this gas jar?
You'll say it and you'll show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think we're going to have to work on developing new types of sensors in the near future that will allow for a more precise definition of human reactions.
This could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good clearance in the depths, it's very important.
- About your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of clearance or depth or something?
- In principle, the present generation is something that can be pushed into our work of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 at a rate of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not about megapixels themselves, it's about matrix and depth.
Last but not least, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the X- and Y-axis authorization, but also the Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes, of our Redmond laboratory, made a controlled processing delay sensor from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I could use the equivalent of such a device in my work, just not requiring a second's attention.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the signal.
Now, the third camera is actually the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially higher number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera's curvature and see how this would help in the three-dimensional determination of the situation.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its points to the audience.
Don't you think, in terms of the everyday use of focal reality technologies, that's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking, holding a smartphone in your hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "passing" complemented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from a point to a smartphone, a projection display and beyond.
The glasses are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time the weakness - complemented reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's just say that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often referred to as criticism: there is no tactful response!
My hands can't feel a thing!
What are the answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be an addition to tactile feelings.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of cover for the image.
She's a great pressurist!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to give these images in the air to resuscitation -- for example, the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a sense, but so far it's very weak -- as if you've got pillows.
And there are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers -- also a forward-looking direction.
- Were you trying to fool your brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that before.
There is another challenge that remains to be tackled for a long time — how to force a person in a very limited space to believe that he is walking on an open, virtually endless scale — to work on the concepts of race paths (not quite like clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
While lying to the brain is achieved in average, work for many years is still in progress.
This is what makes working on the virtual reality so attractive to a researcher -- a lot of things in an entirely inn.
Tasty instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project “Peterburg Avantgarde” on the citizens ahead in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top-list has already caught up with the bright characters of the art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, past the Russian reputation.
The new character, Rosbalta, is an epic artist named Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all the red ones that are found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, at fashion parties and at weddings.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they are.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Petersburg socio-philosophy storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late '80s, early '90s.
In addition, he is a city man who, by his appearance in the streets, makes the citizens smile and cheer them up.
Recently, he took the charm into his hands and became a Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this difficult role with all his godly existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around town in all the red, not the yellow, or the burgundy, for example?
- I picked a red color as a model of vision and image.
In this world, a red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and society.
While everything in society is almost gray, it is an act of aggression and inciting bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting the conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevskok, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
At that time, the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I began to associate with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonite that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me into the theater, the clothes, the music, all the genres except the word.
It was important for me to feel at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took over the territory of Pushkinska-10, and there was a music club, a religious club, a home of the Petersburg Godem.
Many were born there: NOMS, Tequila Jazz, I remember Schnura being brought in with the Van Gogh Ear Project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the fanner, they were wearing a tight shirt, among them was the fashion composer Igor Wdowin.
When the band played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programmes to the Hali-Gallivic times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we gave him a great career, and he got basic education and education.
The "D 137" Gallery, the "Griboids" Club, is a response from Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and our people have gone forever.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the interview was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination of "The Wizard of the Year" was called me, my culmination ended.
In the new times, the old rules are insensitive to work, and I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It's easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are shared, we can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is well-known.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a program show, "The Russian Clown Museum."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being that way is painful and scary.
But in clowns, things get messy, and tragedy gets away.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian rescheduling in order.
Now they meet on their clothes, focusing on the outside mechanics, not on the inside person.
Or maybe he can't have his hand and spit in the flower.
And the deception will be removed with the help of a change of clothes.
And recently, we've seen you as a city charmer.
I don't know who they're gonna be.
- Well, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactical, sweet.
There's disintegration of cultures.
People used to crash into rooms, and the gods loved one another, and the commoners loved the other.
Now they're all broken up into microcommunities, and now it's hard for everyone to like it.
I'm not a $100 paper to everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailova's coming a few thousand!
- He's got the fliers coming in, and the sex and social spheres are working.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, less money, more and more.
I've got fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin what they've earned.
I used to write paintings like that when I was a young man, one collector had them on a wall next to Falco and Laryon hanging.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Now it's often confusing.
They say it's a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, raised on the example of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, giving up money to paint paintings.
That's the culture I'm after.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an official from a culture.
But not everyone can do culture.
With the right kings, the kings may not have understood the culture, but they realized that they needed to hold the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they're stuck because they need higher-level experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
Now it's delicious.
The same Eraarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted by us, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has a lot more culture, there's soil.
And on our rocks art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the early centuries.
Project implemented by St. Petersburg Grant
To give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with grounders on board are heading for the search for a planet.
To preserve mankind, the main question is, How can we continue our race in a state of ignorance or on the same reserve planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars”, says Senior Researcher of the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more lively, the surface of Venus is at 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus orbit... in space.
To address the issue of reproduction in space, the flora began.
Half a century ago, they did experiments on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then there is the release into orbit of insects, tiny fruit fly drosophylls.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of unconsciousness.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird out of here.
And here comes the problem.
“The problem is that the bird must find its support, it must get up on its feet and start moving,” explains the head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Rán Vladimir Sychev.
Without resistance, the birds scolded in an orderly manner.
Ten hours later, the newborn had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they just died.
"And twice we have hatched the birds, then we have refused because it is simply impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in space Vladimir Sychev.
With the animals, the last time a biological "minitzer" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only the same-sex individuals will be present on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered there.
"It was just on the biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," Vladimir Sychev notes.
After the landing, there was a progeny in space rats.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not a simple task.
Animals, losing their habitable environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
But man, unlike animals, in principle, may be.
Homo sapiens has an abstract mind, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is a woman's organism.
Our Tchaika has flown away, and no one on Earth could say that it will remain after the flight into space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
“No one has answered this question,” says Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to outer space, the first cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijaan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitzka, the second cosmonaut, was born twice in orbit and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough units, there are cosmonauts, and after long flights, they're all gone, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," says the cosmonaut pilot, the Soviet Union hero, the Russian hero Valery Polakov.
Yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
Here, at zero buoyancy, astronauts work on open space skills.
Water imitates ignorance.
If for adults, the water is comfortable, but it's a foreign environment, it's a natural trait for breast-fed children.
It's as if the little gouts have confirmed that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby being around nine months in the mother's fertilized fluid, and it's easier for him to get used to the water.
It's logical, in principle, because it's only been two weeks since the birth of that first bath.
"It's very little to forget," says Martin Aksenov, a breast-feeding instructor.
In other words, if the unborn child has a more natural state, it takes gravity and gravity for the woman to be born.
The muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to push the fetus are shaking very quickly.
All right, let's drop it by relying on the progenitors.
Of course, in a special cell, she can give birth, she can push him out.
"And what else?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special exercise load suit.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment, which you and I are going to go to when you have a child born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person, a completely disadapted person to Earth," says the chairman of the IMBP's bioethics committee, RA Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
Later, however, it will be a reality for earthlings on their ships to travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit and Audit Office: The check of the malfunction system was failed by politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good controls and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit and Audit Office, from an interview for the site Aktuálno.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack,” commented Kala’s current situation.
Such findings are provided by a joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Nest's approach to the so-called malfunction system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is this prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions which are required to verify and enforce obligations,” notes Kala.
At the audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties comparing the legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was that about?
There's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation asserts how public procurement is to be undertaken, national legislation is to be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in the course of the pending verification, interesting differences have been found -- easier to say, we may have the law “accurate and unmistakable”, but in the practice of applying some parameters, we will resign Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, and it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you what it means to you?
Such joint control can contribute to efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not result in a positive outcome.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to do that that's reducing the restrictions on orders.
Perhaps this system will be overcrowded with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the limit did not go down.
You are referring to the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is there an organization like our C.I.A. or does it work differently?
With regard to the institutions, there is also a committee working in a slightly different way, but mostly the two institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level - their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal accounting chambers.
As far as local law is concerned, it's simpler than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be certain that it is the best in everything.
Is that because they're better able to control themselves?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But we have to say that even model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperating with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment, how did the consequences come about?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our monitoring work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay has to be taken into account.
We're only taking this into account in the process of preparing future checks -- we've started using our new "detection of the risk of economics" tool, through which we've driven out almost 14,000 public contracts, and we've analyzed them, and that's where these changes are going to appear, because the constraints are changing, the terms of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add to the burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will become worse” and cannot be respected.
In the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the public procurement law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth strengthening the law in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but should not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GWP would not bother entrepreneurs with checking the so-called Schwartz system.
Is the Schwartz system prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies entrusted with the obligation to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're changing this law and we're going to solve it," but we can't say we're going to pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules as to how and what should be formally carried out, and that is correct, and this will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass through.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing through, but somewhere with more caution.

This morning in the Carlovar region, roads were paved, but some frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it must be slightly warmer.
The snow has ceased in the region, with only a small layer in the lowlands.
However, on the ridges of the Red Mountains lies about three inches [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it was known that the places were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 and first-class roads in the region are currently on the freeway.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are also covered.
But some of their sites still contain the remains of the frozen and snow - covered areas.
Special attention should be paid to high - altitude roads.
Pardubice and Kraljevjegrad region
The Czech Highway and Highway Administration on its Internet pages reports that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are at risk of starvation, while mountain roads and high - altitude roads may be covered with snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holodeck that can be formed especially at the heights of the Pardubice region.
The holodeck may be around Lanskroun, Usty nad Orlicí, Policeky, Svitavi or High Mito especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially is snow lying on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlick Mountains.
The paved layer of snow is situated on roads situated in the highlands of Richnova nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today, the changing cloud is without precipitation.
Temperatures usually vary from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzen Region
Roads in the Plzen region pass this morning, but places need to be guarded and adapted to the weather.
In the morning it's freezing, the temperature is going from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it may be slippery in some places.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 is now almost unlimited, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In the southern Plzeň and Tahov, the cold spots may be found.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and in this case there is also a warning about the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-road roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading for the highlands of Olomouc today must take into account snowstorms on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Riding Hood and on the road towards Videlski Kršž.
At night, snow forced road workers to enter the street, according to traffic information, about two inches [3 cm] of snow fell in Sumperka.
In other parts of the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"There are remnants of snow on the highlands of Sumper.
Drivers heading towards Esenika should bear in mind the presence of snowballs in the Red Riding Hood," the CHAN (Czech News Agency) said today.
During the night, their colleagues from Esenik went to clear the roads and assured them that the roads at high altitudes after chemical treatment remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are unfettered, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in forest areas where moisture is still available.
Oral Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow falling, the mountain road is closed at the Telenice site at the Clinic in the Ustec region.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads. In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report a famine in the vicinity of Damage.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for his education at night -- all day long it rained and snowed, at night the sky was clear and freezing.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main road and on route I/13 on the border of Ustec and Liberec.
Because of the snow - covered branches of the trees on the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica, Kninica.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy
How do you feel about the end of the world less than a month from now?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
What's more, in December you're going to give a completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced at 11:10 p.m. on 21 December.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava are held in parallel.
They'll end up, roughly, when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours ahead of ours, ends with a May calendar.
Who thought of that idea?
At first it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusto.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world that we will once hand over to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of footwear, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world.
The Tap Tap team, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called “The End of the Light Fails”.
Will you hear the hymn you already love at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if all comes true and the end of the world does not come.
He'll be sang by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the gymnasiums will also sound on live television in Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the Thomas Ganak video, and Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charitable events and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turns out that many people like working with us, they're interested.
What will come of the concert versus the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO Barrier Education Centre, we have been doing so for the sixth year with the Tap Civil Association at the Edlički Institute.
Teachers regularly attend the Edlicki Schools and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are thus trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project for the additional construction of the Edlički Institute, a separate building will be set up in the future, to which we will move with the project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to draw up a programme that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dana Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi will perform in Prague.
You can find both details at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “grandior activities” in the future?
For the first time in May, we will be performing at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be delighted to have a presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
As far as you're concerned, you've made serious plans, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, as long as we've dealt with this without any problems, Czech CSA airlines and British airlines have always been excellently prepared for us, which has surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
Travel abroad allows you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that it is still at the core level in the East.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are still many barriers, and there is a separate movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
It's not like there's any banal stuff going on, either, like giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, should we constantly catch up with the best countries?
There's a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in which we and The Tap Tap are a little ahead!
Respect for the public or dissension is one thing, but when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us, then everything will really start to change.
As long as they're single cases, they're people of great will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I joined Edlitzka's Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself, including on a saxophone, my colleague and I organized an interesting music ring.
Well, over time, as our lead Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of control.
Has popularity only come in recent years, or am I confused?
It is true that we have helped to join the famous singers and to work actively on the propaganda of the group.
We've come to the conclusion that work that no one can evaluate is as if there is no one.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the Tap Tap so good for you?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
There's a lot of things in Shaw's business that imitate each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it goes on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary because people with limited abilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned individuals that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Have you succeeded in being a strict leader, as many view you?
If we want to do our job well, we must be in many ways uncompromising and disciplined.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend training courses, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
At present, there are twenty members of the Tap Tap Tap group.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, at the Fléda and Ostrava Club, in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a calf at the time of the performance of the band The Tap Tap "The End of Light is over".
The aim of the project is to raise 25 million kroner funding for the purchase of multi-functional barrier-free equipment for the STUDeo Educational Centre at the Edlička Institute in Prague.
The ticket to the concert is 400 crowns, for children up to 12 years of age free entrance. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in several Agency projects over the years.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always understood.
Recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, which on 6 December 1933 presented an idea in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory from his innovative work “Introduction into Space Science”.
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years Sterfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch's Prize for Space Introduction.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great advocate of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space propagandist, and his contribution was assessed by the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway train equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket had to be used to launch or brake the trolley.
The information on this cloth is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to contemplate missiles.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzicki.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press developed the idea of a photoelectric fighter missile proposed by the Rogozinski engineer, and the following year came the work of the Air Torpedo Missile and Air Missile Bomb by the author of Leliva-Kjioblocki.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Prior to the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee) coordinated all work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the beginning of the war ended.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polish Society of Astronautics).
For the first time, society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which publishes four voluminous articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovic suggested that a society should be organized for space.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already in circulation, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has tried to join the International Astronautics Federation (based in 1951) and has already become a member in the autumn of the POA.
The following year, the first President of the PLA Kazimež Zarankević (1902-1959) became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Meteorological Missile), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first was launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built and tests of a two-stage RM-2 rocket were conducted in the Bled Desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work, the RM-34 rocket could have traveled 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM rockets were succeeded by the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designed as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a starting weight of 380 kg, was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (the Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The ruling had sparked a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that separate economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and free, free movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) there is a price pressure.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation when a producer tries to stand in economic competition through the delivery of cheap goods by “beating” the cost of a competitor in order to take most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for the majority of entrepreneurs either to move production abroad or to buy cheaply abroad or to disappear, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than in others.
As private capital is not responsible for any social responsibility, including unemployment, the inescapable cost of the State for social needs is on the rise.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the lords of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious private capital practices create situations at the economic level of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own populations free private capital despite the social decline.
This is particularly reflected in the changes in existing legislation.
The objective is to force its people to submit to the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty and the gap between the poor and the rich are increasing.
For several years, there has been a public distribution of products to the poor who are unable to feed themselves on their own labour.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases where employed people receive such wages that the State has to pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional workers of the Bundestega.
Economic measures in virtually all the southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to exist on a depraved wage outside society in the hope that private investment capital will ever arrive in the country.
But where would he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the share of European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the mass media claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy.
Further, the question should be answered as to whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the same whole State, operates for its own selfish purposes?
A clear answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipresent lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a bottomless situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In FRG, the situation is that public ministries are tasked with drafting draft laws to private legal firms that are closely linked to industry because of lack of funding.
Those bills were then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole power comes not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly in the situation described by Appian in the book The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii: “The State has long been falling apart, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Collections, illegal receipt of graces by means of stones and swords.
"...the good people did not even run for governor, at the end of the day the state lost a consul for eight months." "They began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was the self-government and the need to choose an energetic man." Apian thought it would be Pompey, but Caesar had finally changed democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, in modern society, self - centered interests prevail without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for public use.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the Fascist and Communist regimes must be found in the reckless liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries economic systems.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, followed by the next tour.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solutions are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"There's no way out of violence and there's no way out of it" - Sting, the song "The Crush," where the main verse of the chorus is the words "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want a war, there wouldn't be a war." "The dying Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild."
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many responses.
Some advocated Israel, arguing that it had the right to self-defence and that Palestinians acted as terrorists, others supported the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and that the State of Israel was attributed to the role of the terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who in these recurrent wave of murder is a criminal and who the victim, after all, today's Israeli citizens, including self-governance territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small stretch of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether someone has been behind their throne, directing their actions towards their predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we are living at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the head of the bar (I don't know if anyone is above them, but it's not excluded) - Rothschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The First News Agency (Reiters) bought them back in the 1990s to end the rumors that their name had been associated with the criminal acts in the higher realms in which they were in the shadows, and that always led to the strengthening of their power, the enrichment of their wealth, both at the same time and to others.
They have large shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not have their share, they wage or prepare war (there were only 7 countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four remaining, but the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist that family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the Central Bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (understand government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (the federal reserve system), was killed in 1963, and Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying the Fed for the opening of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created by the great Albert Pike Masson of the 33rd.
The goal of the first war was the destruction of monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, particularly Britain, and the third was to reduce the world ' s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families working with the Rothschilds operates is the challenge of crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the FED basis, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by launching the Greater-Vistian Revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarranted in military and economic terms by the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the Royal Russia) and, consequently, the fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the opening of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a precondition for the radicalization of the debilitating masses, then it was only necessary to give the Germans a strong enough to blame and to offer simple decisions by the Chief, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to act as a fifth column, when it ignited the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothshilds provoked the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the historic Judea and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains where he had originally been held by the bankers, or if everything he had done had been planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to create a third stage of war.
If international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, would be the victim of fighting on the front lines, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where insults are caused by the endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to vote in elections exclusively by their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of the hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing his utmost to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to become a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20% of all world oil stocks (a navigation corridor of only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is David Rockefeller's 1994 words: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a being under total control.
"And He causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not known by the name of the beast or by the number of his name may not buy or sell.
This is wisdom. Anyone who has a mind can calculate the number of beasts.
For it is in the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic protestor students captured the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, a positive outcome was not anticipated - it could not afford to throw chess overboard because it could have fundamentally undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the achievement of the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not in a position to do so.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
A film directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy, six workers had escaped.
After the difficult peripetions, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, assisted by an extravagant cover legend that they had gone on Canadian passports as members of the filming group that had sought a place in the country to film a science-fiction epic.
A combination of genres
The plan, which Tony Mendez's "evacuation expert" invented, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be true, the specialized journals wrote about the draft film, held press conferences, and the imaginary production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Affleka's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called film-movie, the story of good luck, the affair, could be an example of a series of films about Ouschen's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the titres show signs of historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there is no big difference in this).
On the other hand, facilitated Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- the men in the suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating table, on the steps of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to make an excellent career start.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be a laughingstock.
"Operation Argo" of its third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "Grod" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film by Affleka not to be filmed in the home town of director Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is related to the qualities that raised the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events -- the opening scenes of the embassy's collapse are impressive with clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve similar effects in the stage of fiction (the fake headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story did not imply a multitude of exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's doing quite well with this little thing, sometimes he thinks something -- it's not so elegant there (the scene where the phone call in America prevents an emerging crisis at Tehran Airport, and the pursuit of the runway looks pretty preposterous).
The lack of Argo is a distraction due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very generous, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from unique in the film.
Affleka's film lacks a little drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the design and retro style that regenerates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's a pain in the ass.
After all, that is enough to remind us of one, still in the known sense of living history, as well as the exaggerated perceptions of all-powerful and all-knowing special forces.
Airballs, bananas and circuses
The web portal www.bankovnipoplaky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce the “most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“We were encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies”, said Patrick Nager, “right”.
Among the absurdities already put forward, a recent decision by the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place by the end of February 2013,” said Nager.
The EU's controversial orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or the directive on the size of cells for chickens, which resulted in a substantial journey of eggs this year.
The use of the term “butterbrown oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps has also been effectively banned.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 cm long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (in this way, even under the threat of veto, it now defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have shown “anomalous curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission had justified itself by harmonizing existing different national rules that had made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has, however, eased standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives would lead to the spread of products.
Last year's EU regulation may also be a candidate for the prize, according to which air balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without the care of adults.
The EU has applied for American studies according to which air balloons are the potential cause of death by strangulation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are not allowed to blow in fairies.
Fun ideas are also born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is absurd enough: anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, but should instead say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplaky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, proposed for a vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, e.g. the EU food stock rule in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum quantity of food stocks that may be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established quantities of preserved mushrooms, for which it was at risk of a large fine.
Organizations of the questionnaire were also interested in paying some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of granting grants to grant applications.
But these ideas came about in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then, in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace (CHR).
As an argument, he indicated that the country had a high yield of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks to be exported.
For being far away from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Grants for the grant were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies should have been made for the preparation of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Curious orders are the exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as more effective functioning and development of the European Union, are more likely to be recognized.
An important problem, experts believe, is the collection of EU grants for projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It is emotional among the Czechs and that, like in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, retained the name Olomouc Cheeses, but the Tuzemsk Rom, whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, had to be renamed Tuzemak by our producers.
Only products made of cane distillate, not sugar beet, cane products, cane products can be called rum.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-renowned feta and gorgondzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lubek or Parmish hamster, has already included, for example, Karlovar dryings, hillbilly and trchebonian rock and jaundice hops.
The EU’s trademark can also be proud of the Pardubica spice and the bitter tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man get in his head to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If we had everything running smoothly in the country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't watch the country get excited over the past 20 years about thieves being wasted, raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I have been forty years old and I am an independent person who is not party to any party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You're in the Senate, but you're on your way to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I kept saying I'd be involved in the presidential castle fight, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument through which I can carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the most extensive powers.
But the problem is not only that we're like a nation in a bar or a TV set, but we're willing to melt down anyone who tries to make a difference.
In addition, the media, who defile a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie, are added.
For example, I was told that I bribed journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgie Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You have begun the fight for the Presidential Castle with the ideas of the substantive and criminal responsibility of politicians and the reverse property declarations of over twenty million.
To do so, it is necessary to change the law.
You don't have such powers as president, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the tour to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately interfere with it, and that deters citizens.
As an independent, unparty person, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that, without partying, without looking at the dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
You think you're more of a right or left person?
From the Czech point of view, I think people think I'm more of a left person.
It doesn't matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not that someone's right, it's someone's left, it's that I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether the HCHM or the GDP will offer it, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove this by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for the firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
It may be called populism, but all the suggestions I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have slogans.
And with that, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them into our own, so that we can achieve our own.
Had I been elected president, it would not have been a problem to have a direct television broadcast in which I would appeal to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell us why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that will sound abuse, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President - it was a merit of public pressure.
I'm saying directly that I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and opinions.
I'm just starting politics, and I'm going to try to get majority support for my programme.
I am trying to move on my own; if this does not work, I will be finished in six years and return to the private sector.
It partly sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I've bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused to work hard.
I also at least supported the lead investigation by journalist Jan Lorentsov, who uncovered the fraud of light oil products.
I put out my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm on weights.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went to the establishment chose.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are you doing on your own?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more million in the account.
By the way, aston martin appeared to me because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, who was gallant with women, and at the same time he was fighting corruption and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martin, you own 60 million dollars worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs are essentially going to cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live for this money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So you're going to continue to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to cut this down?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the director of the tourist agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a no-silver who will keep the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting on a monthly basis?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
And if I were president, I'd be done with my entrepreneurship.
You'll find a full interview in Saturday's edition of Right.
The architects of MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example, Spain and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building fun, it looks futuristic, and we can finally see something interesting again," said Lizette Verheig, passing the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a big company nearby, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now no one goes to such old-fashioned libraries voluntarily, right?
Spaykenisse, a small bedroom under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this aggravating circumstance, several years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges depicted in euro banknotes in the form of picturesque miniatures made of concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had only one chance to resist statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas, from the Rotterdam architectural office of MVRDV, master of bold bar graphs and author of sharp, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the task of his usual indigestion and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his armpit and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was puzzled and held their shoulders together, the bold Maas put together his original gift as a pyramid in size and completed his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal, "The Book Mountain" in Speykeniss, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain grew to 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential homes and Townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second Best Library of the Netherlands 2012 award.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Timber Competition.
Thus, the impersonal suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an amazingly unbelievably beautiful town hall, whose white facades suggest a milk factory, have become richer for one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, the town's first public building of cultural purpose has emerged in Speykeniss.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado's book cap for cheese.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because true architects and readers prefer to explore the area on foot.
The glazing of all sides of the room is bright and easily visible, the fields of the burned brick and the elegant street lamps provide an unmistakable sense of public urban space.
The city's environment is perfect.
The view is reluctant to look for skamps, dogs, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
“The bookshelves usually stand along the facades and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually insensitive and impersonal,” says Vinnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space on the head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book forest has been used skillfully: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black bookshelves, which serve as a wall compartment, are especially happy with the parapets, the ladders.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even tempted architects and builders are lost in the conjecture of what this unknown material is.
“We tried to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spakenisse community, according to the standard.
And once at an agricultural company in Friesland, we met an appropriate by-product of agriculture.
For many years, artificial fiber material of millimeter thickness has been used as a base for heat treatment and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in this size - was pressed in a four - inch [4 cm] panel.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplasty (KLP) becomes dark, homogeneous, solid material, slightly resembling a new car and a little crossing.
It's 105 degrees to the top.
The one who travels almost 500 metres will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, especially the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs for a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project on environmental issues,” says Trouburst.
The heat of the earth is used to heat it and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is standing under a glass cap, even in bright days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Wide farms of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, cast a shadow and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verheig was already here.
As well as the professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg “the soul of Spain long overdue”.
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each individual was invited to contribute one book from his own congregation.
These books were to occupy empty areas in the regiments of a library that was not yet fully completed, with 70,000 books at the time.
The idea worked.
The regiments are pushed up.
"There's nothing worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winnie Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, now every inhabitant is somehow connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for adornment.
Thus, MVRDV was able to address the royal task, which is called the creation of identity in the professional jargon.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point to build an identity.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the US-Europe liaison expert, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic road.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position is not supported either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from a policy that the United States was governed by to its own German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent common policy for Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are once again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they only perceive their role, they are on their way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
The foreign policy pursued by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a national position independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to that, it's not entirely a unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I'm sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are divergent views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly advocated.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has sufficient understanding of the European position at heart.
But with regard to the local political situation, the Government certainly cannot take that position openly.
I believe that substantial differences of opinion are not as significant as always.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all thrilled with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would have been a little easier for the Germans if there was a single, undisputed European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead on the basis of their own vision.
That's exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position in the future.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
It's always been a touchy topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is Germany still playing a leading role?
Germany has not yet gotten used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
The Germans are not just dealing with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, which is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who's left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's a life that makes you feel uncomfortable or hateful.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - the world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a name that is officially registered in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it was established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have brought a claim.
Yet, it is not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"For foreigners, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in trademark violations in the Far East.
Every week, on my desk, there's a new case like this.
It is sufficient for copyists to add only a few letters to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, you can register Prada-Kny instead.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch is opening a file with the registration agency in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, an artificial name that also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that Chinese are champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
Large cities have multi-storey universities that sell almost exclusively forgeries.
However, Pattloha does not, on the instructions of his trustees, object to the right of Chinese enterprises to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the trademark registration agency.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, the passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It's damaging to the business, it has to be fought," Pattloch said.
“The brand is washed away, the unique situation is lost, the image suffers greatly.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are calculated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, the removal of questionable records in the trade mark register is difficult and costly.
The process may last up to nine years, with a vague outcome.
Pattloch describes the cases in which the court dismissed the claims, since after a long period of time the contested name became “the reality of the market”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his trade mark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous works on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the Sany construction machinery, an enterprise that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete plant.
Thus, Chinese still have the right to use a Mercedes - like emblem.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste fashion goods lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The record of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency situation in the work process to a norm”.
For example, the number of pending cases of objections has decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It's worth fighting for.
As often in China, numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trade mark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China, for the tenth time in a row, has led the list of new registrations worldwide, the agency reports.
The same applies to the total number of valid trade marks, only 5.5 million items.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The opposition is worth much more than the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have succeeded in eliminating the illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the copycat secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
It was a failure of its own, as the names in Germany were not to be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Prime Minister of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following cases, but the other side continues to fight.
It's important to keep an eye on it.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and it takes up a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could hardly be accounted for, the firm’s archives had to be examined even centuries ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite party “a large six-digit amount in the euro” for a settlement.
"From here it's clear how expensive it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to change even to Europe.
That is, if the copycats register unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather products.
The concert has long stopped production in these areas, but has nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
"We have to wait," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloch's lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark protection provisions, rather, foreigners should “anything that is worth protecting should also be registered in China”, says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses his last act on a trade mark, he will have to pay the opposite party licence fees for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Smacking, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbunga Choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
History of relations that have exceeded more than 8,733 kilometres.
First, we give out the sinking: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women’s boats and men’s shoes pick up and quickly find it on the floor.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of singers — alt, bass, tenor, and soprano — grow slowly — come on, charm, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his uterine shoes when he drives them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday night, at the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbonegi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human genetics specialist to a courtship, attended the rehearsal.
Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of people has its own text, including in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which speaks eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are some 34 million people living with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essiegeni, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, the head can be taken over.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch at Gogo Centre.
Imbones in Zulu mean a storyteller or a praiser.
They don't talk about running to a band in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time, it even takes them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, the village of Esitzhni, which depends on the voices of the German people, is located in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some still living in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HD virus.
At Essitchen, the miniature reflects the disease of all of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world for UNICEF data.
The cutting of the excruciating flesh of men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland are carrying an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint visit to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before, Imbogni saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants, for several euros a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir started a group called Voices for Africa, which has since been almost professional in caring for AIDS orphans in Essiegen.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STD is syphilis, chlamydiasis, and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Locust pedicule and garlic are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha's Institute assumes that in at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases with chlamydia infections, trihomoniasis, candidiasis ( fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infection belongs to this group.
Chlamydia infections are more common among young people than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How do the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis, according to the Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were some 2,700 cases in 2011.
That's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms suggest a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases, genital ulcers, complaints of urinary discharge, secretion, abdominal pain, and bubbles or sealing may occur.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
The condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of frequent sex-replacement.
In early diagnosis, most STDs can be cured and far-reaching effects avoided.
Chiefship, donations, and not least, the honors of speaking to people all over Germany allow for something to be collected.
“We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essitchen,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is used by Tsodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well - arranged, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulu's old women, is the stronghold of the village.
Some of them take up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that children appear in the form of children on time each day.
Those who have no parents go to a shelter in Hanisil, a single woman who gets paid by the union, as well as two cooks that prepare for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two smokers, and together with the American Health Organization, PSI organized HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country is preferred to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
It's quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the spread of the HD virus so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh."
To support cultural exchanges, the Ibmogni choir travels to South Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern part of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the black language -- such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happens to cause tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitchen, where singers visit children in charge.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on a map, it is more famous in the Etsuleveni Valley.
"Go to Essiegen, there's light," people here say.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the melting singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA Opens Mercury Ice
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The NASA Space Agency has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also freezing water, as appears from three studies published Thursday in a special journal called Science.
The Messenger Zone has found evidence that the ever-shaded region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 cm or perhaps up to 20 meters.
Water is supposed to come from comets or possibly asteroids that encountered Mercury.
No one links the opening of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said probe scientist Sean Solomon.
Mercury temperature may reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life have gone to other places in the solar system.
Undetectable for earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little eyelets into infinite givers.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is looking around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, by a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planning”.
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, the more difficult it is to identify pink “born” stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation -- scientists call it W5 -- unromanticly opened with a Spitzer telescope in Cassiopei constellation, 6,500 light-years away.
This overcrowded glow of the dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A doughnut-like ring consists of a material that the star threw away during the dying process.
In the giant nebula of Triffid, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of a galactic maternity center.
The star formation of the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, the color telescope works better.
As the red eye winks at the observer's nebula on this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Similar to the continent on Earth, this nebula is called North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides a clear coloring.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of the Spitzer infrared sensors.
Saturn and his rings: As they emerged, one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's a fragment of Saturn's moon that disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Waterworks galaxy
Depending on the coloring of the images of spiral galaxies, they are transformed into actual works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the remote light-years of the Triphid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three - part, three - part trifidus), since the dark stripes of dust divide the heart of the stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Dragonbearer, astronomers photographed a premonition of a space collision: At 400 million light - years from the Earth, the cores of the two melting galaxies collide together and will inevitably collide.
It was the birth of the star that the Hubble telescope took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
The one who doesn't like technical cuts can call it the Southern Pipe Wheel.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris's nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
A 1,400 light-years-long nebula consists of particles of dust that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal household dust.
This image was made up of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed a Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starry nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The stellar cradle is constantly creating new stars.
It's a star cloud connected to Rosette's nebula that's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years from Earth.
There's no dust in this bright, bright galaxy with a small black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views on the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersge, even before Galileo Galileo began observation of the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Telescopio Canarias Grand has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The "Big South African Telescope" mirror in South Africa has been segmented to reduce costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches about 11 metres in diameter.
Lack of low-cost design performance: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its specificity: high light-gathering capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to alien signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Alien Mind Search (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computer power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's a "Very Large Telescope" that's completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even an average infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
The establishment of a European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned in the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror shall be extended to a total of 42 metres and shall be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photographs should not be expected until 2018.
By 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano had been considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 metres in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks at the sky with Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, Mauna Kea must have a new giant telescope with a mirror 30 metres in diameter.
Here they can enjoy illustrations.
But the most important species from outer space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photograph sealed the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be deployed to space no earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is that it should be in the light of the first stars and the galaxy to look for the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, since Messinger is moving closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the 2004 Messinger probe, the first to revolve around Mercury, scientists are now convinced of it.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age in the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age in the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Talish Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The van is rocking along a steep road past the dense forests of the hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything's so green and bright, you might think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometres away.
The Tales live here, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is known little, except that they speak beautifully in Farsi and Azerbaijani and have been distinguished for a long time.
The final point is Leric.
The small town is teeming with the overly heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is completely out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
The road has only one lane for 8 hours at 323 km.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea oil is here, to the province, until it's reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something in Lerik to be interested in.
"In May, Baku celebrated the Eurovision song festival, and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulaeva said.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
There's a documented biography of about eight dozen tulips of these places over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is the Shaban Shirali Muslumov, who is said to have reached 168 years of age.
The birth certificate, however, is not.
In view of the fact that the elderly person whose age has been confirmed by the documents has reached 122 years of age, the age of Muslumov appears to be highly questionable.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, apparently having a daughter when he was 136 years old.
So did the muslum caban add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, has heard of the people living in Central Asia.
“A surprising number of people of advanced age can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “there are also very many very old people in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, it was not possible to confirm age scientifically, since there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of warm butter
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the Lerika area are surprisingly likely to reach the age of the Bible.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Muhimzade explains this with special gene talismans.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes it's about food.
Tales love meat, bread and the most dairy products, many of them drink on a glass of warm butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that preserves people's youth?
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil she's running around.
There are eight people under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had grandchildren.
Two little ones will also jump nearby.
In the kitchen guests are made tea, which is served in typical crawling glass of Armuda.
Mirzaev has ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the head covering over the long dark-brown hairs that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always had my hair milked, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
A month's pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what grew up in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband who served in the army.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it was better when Gader Aliev's "beloved father" got in the rudder.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman's speech.
However, the cult around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elderly people.
230 Manats (approximately the same amount of the euro) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is an amount that can be well lived for.
And perhaps the long-grown son of Mirzaeva is also right: “Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect”.
They live in a large family, beloved, caring, and happy.
As long as there's no reason to stay alive as possible
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The competing demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president did not focus on paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but first and foremost to Christian Coptics, liberals, educated Muslims, and nonreligious Egyptians.
After all, they are still hopelessly divided into scattered opposition.
Fear of the religious state in the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim brothers.
Mohammed Mursey, almost apologized, said that he had temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and extended his competence to "save the revolution".
However, what he really wants to do is save a 61-year-old engineer with the doctorate of the American University of South California, who is not very clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were managed in a nightly 15-hour jump with obstacles to an Islamic-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the legal luft that it entails for a stricter interpretation of sharia.
At least this is indicated by a new article: in all Shariah cases, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be recruited to the council.
This should not, but could mean that the clergy are overseeing legislation, which would actually result in a restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians must remain with the military court.
These courts served during the Mubarak period to suppress the opposition.
Following the overthrow of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
Also, as the project states, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values”.
It is not so clear that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
The open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Yet another forbids the affront and defiance of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the wording that prohibits “insulting people” is prohibited.
Will there be enough cartoons for the President or jokes about justice?
The issue of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Mursey proposes for signature and which he said would “very soon” be presented to the Egyptians in a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been forming for several weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in extraordinary unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft Constitution was a place “in the wake of history”.
Through a short news service, he accused Mursey's conspirators of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down," said opposition defender Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not wish to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brothers, in turn, called for an opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and dedicated to the Salafites, who shouted: “The people require the application of God’s law.”
They asked Mursey, "Clean the land!" and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has caused a state of almost civil war.
Mursey's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
“Muslim brothers” said that both opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the electoral urn in which direction the country should go.
Most Islamist projects are considered to be resolved.
“The concept of “human rights” is not mentioned at all”
Hafiz Abu Saeed was furious with this forced constitutional process, which in fact should have lasted until February with the participation of all public forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or brought to trial at Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now the words "human rights" are never met in the new constitution, he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Murcia's influence on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing.
These measures are clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian State, the President de facto annulled it”, regrets Saeda.
Democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Sayeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, looking at the ideological struggle against the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be payment for that.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian raffisk: the world's worst smelling fish?
For the five million people in Norway, one of the highest standards of living is not only in Europe but also worldwide.
Perhaps the secret to this country's success is somehow linked to a local addiction to an extremely vicious fish dish?
Take some ripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to get a pervasive smell of the smell of the raffice, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagerness, three hours drive from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an inexhaustible characteristic smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a forel, salted and drifting in the water up to a year, depending on the kind of mattress that needs to be achieved.
As the twilight and the cold cools down, the Norwegian crowds gather for a festival in Fagerness to discuss the same, let's say, an exciting dish.
“It is eaten raw and drank by a rheumatist, a local dark vodka,” explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and a joint “rhafi general”, who heads the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink it with large portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes an aquavit better than a raccoon," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not as bad as the amount of land you've been driving on a bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, a time of poverty, when, even before refrigerators, fish were slaughtered in autumn in sealed water barrels.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish was well and thoroughly blundered, it was extracted and consumed with alcohol.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of employment and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of the immigrants who are brought here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a long-standing rival, not so long ago and a much more experienced neighbour) come to work here.
The Raffisk is seen as an important symbol, a constant, even a slightly sinister element of Norway ' s past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it will cost you nine pounds ($14) of beer or a sandwich.
Norway rarely appeared in world news, and the majority of the country's inhabitants seemed to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Brayvik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Not to mention his name, the treatise was called “the July 22nd”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders in their peace-loving country.
Norway ' s well-being today is based on the growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, who carries the trays with a long, long hair and amazing blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing off, we're not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandering money they did not have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and walk in the summer, that's enough to make you happy," said Anna.
"And there's a curvature," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I've had enough of that.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat, it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we still have more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
At my hotel, a special dinner is held on a raffisk, during which visitors vote on the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct telephire that shows the lead in the midget, surrounded by plates of rakfice.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what assessment did you place for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our grade."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, maybe taking over the aquarium.
Or maybe just with the smell of that fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, faces a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The road traffic in Mexico City is now particularly deplorable.
The city was overburdened by transport and at the best of times, and steel fences had been erected since Monday, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this has not been done to prevent people from working from the suburbs, but to prevent the protestors from entering the Parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, will wear a presidential bandage and will take over the country.
He faces a challenge.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance with the Felipe Calderon administration, which is now in charge, but the country has become mired in a drug war that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares its willingness to combat violence to the people of Mexico”, Mr. Penya Nyeto told President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Penj Nyeto had developed as governor of his native state of Mexico.
At his home, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A Straight - Lined Man
In the idyllic town of Valé de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Its inhabitants are credited with the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
One of the new roads built by Mr. Peña Nyeto, which differs greatly from the roads with the beatings and pits that were previously on the site, can reach the city.
The plates with its name hang on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.
“We associate with him hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olivera Hernández, State Congressman of the leading Penya Nyeto institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continued stay in power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olivera admits that after his 12-year absence at the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Penya Nyeto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of insubordination that the new President has brought against the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to translating his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent public figure and, above all, a person who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast with the powerful Vale de Bravo streets.
Hidden under the estacades of highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
The problems in the municipality are also severe in nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were recruited to appease drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
In the desert near a large landfill only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Penya Nyeto - this is much greater than the figure in the sadly celebrated city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become repugnant when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Peña Nyeto could best be said to have failed to deal with the problem of killing women during his tenure as governor.
At worst, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A concrete house dweller who resembles most of the houses in this vast area, Irenaeus Buendia, who is struggling to hold back tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believed that her roommate had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed before," recalls Mrs. Bundiya.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already numb.
Mariana’s mother tells this story, and her daughter’s portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs close to the crucifixion on which only one word is drawn: justice.
This is what they say was denied to this family.
"The state officials treated me as an old plot, a disgruntled peacebreaker.
They want people to simply accept what they say and to be modest.
But it is wrong, it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and misreadings," she said.
After putting on the presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nyeto will take the heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violent crimes, and the new President has pledged to make this issue a priority during his rule.
“I hope he will be exactly the same as the Governor,” says Olivera, congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's presence in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires that the case be closed on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, charged with the largest diversion of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment that he said he had to endure while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits to Manning by prison officials within nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the Manning motion for a stay on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and were in itself sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks didn't confirm that it was Manning that was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Feyn and Manning reviewed the reports that had been completed since Manning's visits to the administration during his stay at Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he viewed the treatment of the prison administration as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under review do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manninga was directly questioned about his conditions of detention, Feyn claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about these issues and that his visiting representatives of the Administration had discussed these problems with him and had stated that they would be concerned but not recorded in writing.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I did not raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission dealing with the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was removed from the regime “warning traumatism” and reduced conditions of detention.
The representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited regime of detention - to a level below the suicide-prevention surveillance regime - had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was okay with them to lift the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, in my opinion," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness because of intense heat.
He explained that it is psychologically difficult when you are not allowed to know how your participation is resolved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world was flocking to Camp Arrigan's base, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often even more than 23 hours a day — alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because sleeping or even lying there during the day prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck by a light that penetrated the camera outside.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned into bed at night, he was said to have been awakened and forced to turn around.
Counsel Manning filed an official objection to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he had made during his testimony Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning stated that he had not been able to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said that he had understood from the order of the guard that he should leave the blanket to which he could hide, but admitted that no one had specifically ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a rubber vest or a shoelace to traumatize himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's certificate, his underwear, his hookers, and his glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to experience during his detention and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court that should begin his case early next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with maximum severity.
Among the charges brought to Manning are aid to the enemy, illegal promotion of Internet disclosure, transmission of information relating to national defence, and abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all points of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My national self-determination crisis is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico for lack of self-reliance.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the inhabitants of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin break up between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I walked down the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control area, and stood still.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexiconos (Mexicons), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York think they're Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complex construction of the "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language community, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The meetings of the Presidents of those countries were on the agenda with questions such as immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nyeto was willing to speak about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would now enable Mexicans, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Penya Nyeto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and was forced by rifles to abandon its leaders half of its territory.
But the Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
It is therefore only worth a U.S. official to make a statement of criticism to Mexico, the press and the elite of Mexican society immediately complain that Americans are attacking the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
Mexico's most difficult relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is.
You want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in Mexico, and those who don't.
In L.A., Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin had only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone — father or grandfather — had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- smug, under-educated, of poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we've studied in good schools, and we've done good work, but we can't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
We also know that most of the Mexican elite and ruling class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as second-class people as non-existent Mexicans.
We do not speak well in Spanish, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between true Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans of Mexican descent find this offensive.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican origin do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstein.
Getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I have found during my trip, as if our relations were not yet sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and representatives of intelligence want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
In view of the gap between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking have spread, many of us do not consider this country to be such a beautiful country.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they'll have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still resent how recently they treated their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for the future peace
Is long - term peace between Arabs and Israelis possible in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed has led to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
They sound familiar, pointless disputes about who started the first one; many buildings have been destroyed; over 140 Palestinians have been killed, most of them civilians, and six Israelis; and for the first time during the conflict, rockets launched from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while the Israelites and the Palestinians were hopelessly linked to their eternal conflict, changes had come to the Middle East.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have circled many persistent realities in the rebel storm, and Palestinians with the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the storm that struck the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope that this deadly stalemate will come to an end.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, was to be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said they had forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they had suffered.
Although some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed and 1.7 million have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grew, Hamas developed new influential and rich friends.
The resurgent regional leader of Turkey, who had once been Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed the example of Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas champions claim the establishment of the Islamic Crescent around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which the Hezbollah paramilitary group is ruling, to Syria, where more and more Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region took place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Mursey strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid no attention to Hamas ' support.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic locations, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was laid down.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas' rockets.
Israelis can sleep peacefully for at least some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unwavering position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially in the Government of Binyamina Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, as part of preparations for the 22 January elections, has joined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of perpetuating the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they put all the power into their hands in the West Bank, would they not start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their gatherings in the Gaza Strip do?
It's better to keep them behind the wall, and tighten any attempts to lift their heads.
The supporters of the hard line may win; however, their calculations may be overturned in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries have not the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of Israel's budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The opening of a war with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursey, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic changes occur in the Arab countries, the Palestinian denial of the right to self-determination is a slow-action bomb that will sooner or later explode in the occupied territories of Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has already undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of the growth of the Arab population only exacerbates these problems.
For bloodbath operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, the growing discontent of the international community has to be paid.
Both sides need an external impulse
The only solution that has been repeatedly called upon by healthy representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world, and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions in exchange for security.
The hope remains not too impressive in the short term - the hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries to have a more effective impact on the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to stop arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is more useful than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would have done more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming vote in the United Nations, which could result in recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama must also play a role in placing Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he had never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon returning to the White House, he continued to show that he was unwilling to join the problem.
It's a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
A unified cigarette package law entered into force in Australia.
The warnings of the harm of smoking and images of parts of the body affected by disease are contrasted with those of weary green boxes identical to cigarettes for all brands.
In world practice, Australia ' s uniform packaging law on cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color-coded stamps with the same yellow and olive-coloured box with horrendous pictures of children affected by the disease of parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages introduced on this Saturday is the names of the stamps that are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia declares that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
Such a decision was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 were, in 99 cases, never becoming smokers.
“It is obvious that even at a young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to make through packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world ' s smallest proportions of smokers, so these changes will not have a particular impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those of its origins,” says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for porters and silicone fuses hiding unpleasant pictures on the package has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already realized about 6,000 products to wholesalers and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
In the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among the population targeted by these measures is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertising cigarettes and support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers from placing cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government had prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it could not limit foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you've only got this little lasagna, the idea of moving your goods online will seem extremely attractive," explains Becky Freeman, the following public health issues at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written by persons who are supposed to be ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't regret the power and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company?
The Australian office of British American Tobacco claims that industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry even took steps such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States submitted claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade was unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all those countries with Australia were very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of enacting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photos to warn against the harm of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of strengthening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
The number of smokers in Australia is not being demonstrated by innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide a bag in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of his mouth being swollen on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing goods in regiments
"I used to have an hour to unload a new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, then we would say, well, it's over, we're closing the shop," he said, throwing our hands up.
To miss electronic networks and constant connections in the world is not so bad.
On this day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and had been replaced by another aircraft we had been waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
The noon at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books nor magazines nor iPhones nor even duty-free stores will help.
Recently, however, more scientists and professionals in child development have expressed themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it is not so bad that we and our children miss each other.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Perhaps we should strive for boredom?
Yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll get back to it.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention about recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions of boredom dating back to the first century were found.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
Having studied the research materials on this subject and asked a question to the task force of 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a boring person doesn't do something he wants to do.
There's nothing you want to do with apathy.
The main thing in the long run, he said, was “a disturbance in attention and the resulting deterioration in mood and the feeling that time is moving slowly”.
According to the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that despite the possible connection between these conditions, people who miss the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and people who experience depression, see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when it's just really hard to focus on something.
In his study “Unoccupied Reason: Defining Boring for Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment that participants listened to the recording of a vote reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds outside the area of the television programme included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low noise, so they could hardly be analyzed, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign soundtrack.
Those who heard low - volume TV said that they were bored, more often than not, they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the distraction may be boring, says Mark J. Fenské, Associate Professor of Neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the flow of goods on the conveyor belt in search of marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom.”
It is believed that it continues that when people start climbing on a chair or drawing caracoli on a sheet of paper, they do it for boredom, but now we know that such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not banned from climbing and turning learn better and remember more information than children from whom they are asked to sit modestly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored with the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “steel of boredom” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations, such as “Many of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I am too interested, so there is no time for anything”.
With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys miss girls more often, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various outside annoyers.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Personal and Social Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he connected with nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day using a pager.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3 per cent of parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on how much such boredom would have been now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents are at the peak of boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide fully what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes it is not, because in extremes it can, according to studies, encourage people to act in an absurd and dangerous way, to gamble at risk, or to abuse certain substances in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us that something else should be done; it is boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this very brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you send that energy to a guitar game or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to cope with boredom alone or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he claims.
Your child not only learns to do things on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think we should be bored.
But there's nothing wrong with it either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be bored more often, while boredom is a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people try to get away from constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of our senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a student at a community college in the south-eastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that, once in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and he was driving in a prairie car near the Kansas border when the police stopped them.
After the policeman had discovered marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco had come to the court for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-use device, a small offence for which each was due a fine of $100, and the date of the trial had been set.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts of entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends not on the law but on the place of consideration.
The accusations of minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 years of age and older with small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
In the more conservative districts of Colorado, however, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to be held responsible for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain areas of the West, the vote is to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from appearing in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
The representatives of the control authorities in Washington state are also puzzled about the head.
They need to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado a more orderly market will therefore serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Board for the Management of Production and Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But no one can do more now, Mr. Smith admits, than make any suggestions and hope that this will work.
“We do not have a real precedent on which we could be guided”, he said.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will, for a year, impose a state of uncertainty when the State licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
There are still complex technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the State order of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana companies in the city line, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, representative of the newly established research group “Centre for the Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the City Procurator ' s Office would no longer hold persons under the age of 21 responsible for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would cease to detect people in these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with the regulations governing the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The Weld District Prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Bak, is a stricter approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to be held responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At present, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many have been accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Bak in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in areas such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer bring adults to justice for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges of already open marijuana cases.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes, it is our direct duty," he says.
While 55 per cent of the population in Colorado voted in favour of the decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different states revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The District Prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for the possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They've been after people for so long, they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington, D.C., the first states to have as little marijuana as alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide pilot field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalizationists and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but they are at the same time anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, which are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will move forward on this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of traffickers and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the Federal Government has in most cases provided good medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Bureau of Drug Control are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small packet of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes on state-controlled recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabet, former Drug Control Adviser in Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which could not have been opened sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on marijuana trafficking, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position to issue a license and then cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state has voted for.
There are still a lot of outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogy to an ancient symposium that lays two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the School of History of the University of Wooster in the late 1980s, I collected suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson made a joke about me leaving because I had to drink out of my croissants.
It wasn't really that much fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically digested and intimidated.
Not entirely because of my rather unusual name or what I went to private school.
For one reason only, in this glorious lullaby of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You're gonna ask, why do you think about that now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with right-wing views is subject to the same travesty.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservation students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators at the College of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, personally assaulted and made to feel unwanted” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only been exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary on the policy in the student environment, “The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right”, where conservationists were presented to eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservation Association, who rides in the Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver lining.
In other universities, conservators complain that they are “the goat of leave due to higher tuition fees”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the University of Nottingham Conservation Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “in the university environment there is a growing distortion towards the left.
People who don't even know us, they think we're in a hurry and they think we're the unpunished children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the College of History, Corpus Christie, in which a request for greater protection was made, calls this atmosphere “inconspicuous”, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, a new president of the Oxford University Conservation Association, says that the attitude of students to right-centre media has deteriorated considerably.
“It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and the normal life of members of the club,” she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a slave and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hatred to a conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had voted against former student Margaret Tatcher as a result of a reduction in budgetary allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be insensitive.
On the first days of the freshman week, when the students got to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was ahead.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the grass of conservative students, but they were happy to participate.
Political issues, such as mine strikes, privatization and opposition by the Government to the application of sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in South Africa, have penetrated through the wooden panels of the audience wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, "now dead Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a cake-like face.
"Teachers don't teach French in principle, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
The other students were sneezing.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you are not very busy going back to society," said Pete.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
The other night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone, and then someone grabbed my shoulder.
This was James, a second-graduate student from the English Department, who presented himself as a member of the University Conservation Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Regrettably, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of sympathy for conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, which is why it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labourists."
Later, in the local pub, I tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Ethan, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students took his word for it.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're rolling each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt homosexual before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with the same-minded only under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourist and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years have become like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being an Foreign Policy adviser to Thetcher and one of her spokesmen.
He almost never showed up in college.
He despised it for its provinciality, pettyness and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a teaching post at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieth century, any political views were adopted there.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- They can't do that there, but not in the city of dozing pins...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His wet eyes clouded.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was tired of going to London all the time, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not endure the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week during the seminar, when another history teacher called me “the enemy of the people, ” I decided to do the same.
In my soul, burned with shame, I admitted that I had been brainwashed by my parents, and I called them "old fools."
The break wasn't long.
The last nail in the cover of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a platypus and a twitter.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in a school.
What is sadder is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen prime ministers of the Torah, but is still hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the university in which they value equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
About the Valentino: sewing master exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of an exhibition about Valentino Garavan.
The designer recognized this at the opening of Valentino: the sewing master, a triumphant retrospect exhibition that has brought together more than 130 high-end dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of history, whose only character is "or Signor" Garavan, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until 3 March, personal letters and photographs are being taken with the signature of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social recovery: from the modest port of Vogera in northern Italy to the godfather of the international elite.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with the royal court.
"At least they don't put out their cigarettes' pickles about your magnificent envelope, as some beautiful pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unfavorable host and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We were all very fond of coming to his scarf in Gstaad," explains the former wife of Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Maceu, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Macy recalls the charismatic modeler.
Once we went to his house to have dinner, it was after showing fashion in the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style appeared in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
"Every guest in Valentino felt important and loved," recalls the top model, whose work with the modeler began in 1995 during the Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of style because his sketches are real works of art," she finishes.
Pedigree
The life of Garavan is a story, not of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good manners and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was turned into a glamorous 60-metre-long platform, which offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of models and has to defile on the platform, the sights of the “seeers” from the hills, which glisten with the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the one that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitty used in "The Night" or the coat of hair and skin that belonged to the Empress Fara Dib.
In this audience, the names Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria, or Sofia Gabsburg shine from models.
Nati Abascal and modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget it."
I remember him very well.
They were pants, shirts, razor blades and fall-winter jackets, 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designer's husbands.
"I commend him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Ferria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "approach" his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Legislature of Mode Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget her first time dressed in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on a holiday at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a dress with collars, a "carcase" in it, and a cut with no beads.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo D'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the modeler with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying him."
"King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pauls of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “virgins” (as the modeler calls his stitches) to make this shelve of ivory with the encroachment of pearls, twelve different circles and a four-and-a-half-meter frame.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a tower of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, “return of clients from the higher world”.
The "life style" of the elite has been wasted for many years, and Valentino himself is its best representative.
Cavalry of the Great Cross (sign of the highest rank in Italy), Cavalier of the Labour, Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honourable Legion, Garavani has gathered as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his fineness, his tranquillity, his neat and impeccable appearance,” recalls D. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a dinner party at the Ors Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: coal miners from Kawah-Igen
In four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their job is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living in the Kawah-Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Java Island of Indonesia.
Each day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas rising from the depths of the earth makes contact with the air.
The huge pieces of cheese that can weigh up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up a rocky road.
It takes more than 40 minutes to reach the peak of a 2,386 - foot [2,386 m] volcano, but it takes more than 40 minutes for those who are able to reach their destination to take a cranial step, with difficulty in keeping their balance and carefully grasping the road, so that they do not fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step could cost them their lives, as did a French tourist who had been torn down several years ago from the Kawah-Igen rocks.
The Kawah-Igen shafts earn 5 Eurocents per kilogram of cheese they get
When they are upstairs, they pave the way among tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and carrying heavy baskets tired, marching three kilometres to the weights that the mining company has placed slightly higher at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, rather, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilogram of cheese.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of petroleum production, since it is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
“As the standard is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk”, explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and finally feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems a misery to such an inhumane effort, it is three times as much what he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high on local scale, where 15,000 rupees (€1.2) a day and an average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros),” explains a trucker who had previously worked as a stoner on the Bali tourist island.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as fragile as the cheese: “I married a girl from Bali, where one Hindus brought her to Java to accept Islam.”
Anto asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs all the time, and its eyes go down because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose cheese had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, he's coughing all the time, and he's going to get his eyes out because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a porter in a hotel, but instead he does his job as a mule.
For a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the cheese never ceases to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
To challenge the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of cheese for cost savings and has not provided any equipment to the carriers who work on their own behalf and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) fee for a photo shoot, which, together with an entry ticket of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
“This work is for the cattle, not for the people,” says Badrusin, a root carrier of 42 years who spent three decades in Kawah-Igen, since he left college.
He's capable of raising up to 110 kilograms, he assures himself that he'll be able to work as hard as he can, because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so durable that no one complains of their severe diseases... more clearly than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unajnik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamsari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres [18 km] along a narrow path in the countryside.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unajnik, wide-opening mouth with a few teeth missing.
Of his five children, over 30, he also works as a cheese carrier.
Time passes, but poverty endures from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Igen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and housing and education prices in the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriotic wife, we'll do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem amazing that these lines are part of the marketing of mint stickers, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like “Let's put bao (poo) in the oven” to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty".
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had tried to do much, such as run ghosts with pheromones or organize parties of fast meetings (blitz-dates).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely make a tail?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But it's all very low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict public control.
The rate of birth in Singapore, according to its national population administration, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 was known as a percentage of the replacement in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of Spouse and Family Policy, National Office for the Population, says that the reason for this is “improved education” and “a broader range of career opportunities”.
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities other than weddings and family creation”, she explained.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in the rate of birth in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policies, which aim at a sharp increase in immigration to combat population reduction, are indignant to the local population.
Singapore has websites where there is little hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and refusing to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling Singapore party won the worst result in the elections since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to address the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build such small housing.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development manual has shifted to monitoring the number of small apartments known as the “carcase” that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is the view that they can promote a free lifestyle and discourage the incentives of builders who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their shoeboxes sell much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger - size apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidance for the builders who had previously been put in obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overextended
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have a particular effect.
“People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that is why many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the Government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to children, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Offline personal - personal on-line
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a property of private or “sphere of personal life which is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing on the Internet situations that he would probably not share on the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five children from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal plane, and the "password and name of the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets would not be placed in the post," says ten-year-old Jorge, who has been trying to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On the FB, I download beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I'm also having fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge assures me he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
She knows she has a password to one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Without thinking about it, he said that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't count on anyone recommending him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was able to confide in him or ask for his home address or phone number.
"If they push or demand me, I will simply remove them from my record," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy has no experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the accounting record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photographs of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confused situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's a cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a specialist in education and education, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has appeared as a tool for searching for information, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game have changed”, she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prinski, a teacher from Yale University and the author of the paper Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning ourselves,” she says.
Explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion that can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at a certain age when maturity is lacking.”
"Even to be selective, while most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
She adds, "Talking to them that they should not do this is useless."
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you published like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online the way they do it off-line.
The same rules.
“On the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and should also be on social networks”, she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
Understanding each paragraph, they have good reason to talk to their children about the prerequisites for opening an Internet record.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he said.
According to Gourdiya, the key question is to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ends without the announcement of the Lima Declaration
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) today concluded in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which had been declared previously and theoretically signed by the family as binding participants.
Efe repeatedly sought access to a document signed at the VI ordinary assembly of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at some point.
On the question of the text, they indicated that the content had been presented by President Olianta Umal of Peru during the short statements to the press.
Journalists ' access to information about the Summit has been limited all the time.
During the day, only a video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast, in the press room, without sound, with the message “closed meeting, no sound”.
Few information circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not in Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Presidential Administration of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is a statement by Umala, not an official document that ended the summit.
In the past October, Peru hosted the III South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and at that time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made sure that transmission systems were provided to all journalists, but limited access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict by the Hague Court, which resolves the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began in The Hague on Monday, as part of the charge Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will respect and comply with a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently having before this international court”, said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile has been, is and will be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of differences, pacts and international tribunals”, Pinier added, and welcomed the grip of Umala against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on the maritime boundaries of Nicaragua, which it found to be mistaken.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011, after the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
The President-in-Office, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in the Lima Times.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we expand agreements on residence”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against the uncertainty of citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe in the crisis, “economic integration (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities”, added Umala.
“We decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that would improve the connectivity of South America’s areas, especially in rural and border areas, by bringing our countries together and creating new economic schemes”, the Peruvian President said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru and were confined to the transverse axis on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a greater relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have good relations among neighbours, was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Aftersooth (on Saturday), perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“Let us review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan Pact, which will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope to tell him that we will deal with this as civilised and respectfully as possible”, Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they are scheduled to serve as the new president of the country, Enrique Penya Nyeto.
Also at the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Plan of Action aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru that Europeans “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one homeland”.
It protected, in this context, a project to establish South American citizenship, which is endorsed by UNASUR countries.
“There must be a free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to bring us back to the past”, he warned.
The President of Ecuador also expressed his support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the assumption that the influence of Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those who had signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights taken into account.
Those who read the lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans do, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States”, he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Korea has assured that it does not regret this decision because it did not betray its principles but respected its “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that “in due course there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed”.
He also criticised Swedish justice for requiring it to enter its territory for questioning of the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law alone considers it possible to carry it out through a videoconference that could be made by the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Korea confirmed that there was a risk of deteriorating Assanja ' s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, nothing serious”, said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What's really happening is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to the obstruction in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human being," he added.
Korea indicated that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of integrity that would enable him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the British, Swedish and European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but we have had constant discussions.
“The solution is in the hands of the British, Swedish and European judiciary, because counsel Assanja, Balthasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions”, he said.
And expressed the view that "if Britain provides a guarantee of security tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, interrogates or interrogates Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Korea took advantage of the case to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that it did not tolerate “mediation, dishonesty and falsehoods that distort freedom of expression”.
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion”, he said.
In this respect, he remained satisfied that neither the journalists nor the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemony countries were in control in Ecuador, and added that being re-elected would “encourage the revolution to continue in the right direction”.
Korea also supported the decision to retain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for the coups under the mask of legality” because it “has in fact destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy”.
The President of Ecuador also considered that his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos ' wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries was “fully justified”, following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
To date, this decision has not been respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed the hope that the dispute on maritime boundaries, which was held in the same court of Peru and Chile, would be well concluded and said that “it is right for Latin America to turn to international authorities if the two countries undertake to make a decision, however difficult it may be”.
With regard to the possibility of candidateing for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for the third consecutive term, he said that he was considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult”.
Correa assured that if he lost his election in February 2013, he would be out of public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be rectified by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so that this responsibility must be recognized”, he said.
If we won, it would be my last term as president, and then we would be out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Korea also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned was routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean an exacerbation of President Chavez’s health”, he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his analysis of AIDS had produced positive results.
"It's like I've been deafened," he remembers the difficult one, despite all the doctor's tactics, the moment.
A young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified, he had already noted his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he got into 1994 and overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with the “human immunodeficiency virus” (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would have been hard to believe that — too few treatments were available, too few were aware of the disease, too biased for the sick.
So, even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Social Protection Institute didn't want to say good-bye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive the syndrome and do so without making life’s quality worse.
However, without knowing their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, their immune system has "existed", and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “it is a major achievement to date that the survival of the patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectionist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent to which the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis is affected, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the foregoing means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, according to these terms, “supporting control can live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy for Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Halisco in 2011, and 187 deaths were already registered by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still flight results?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I imagine, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, which is, at the late stages of the disease.
He provided a breakdown: “Nine out of ten patients come in when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale for all people who ask for it.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA) and patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, have sought to verify the private laboratory, motivated only by his friend and, despite his youth, he has already been in the AIDS stage and even suffered sarcoma Caposa, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'm better off three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care for myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to promote his statement to those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are fearful.
Let them check that if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they were HIV positive, and if they already had a diagnosis, let them know that they could live like any other person who was responsible.
This report summarizes the issue of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Precipitation condoms
The great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has addressed HIV-related issues.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places devoted to this task, "there has actually been an increase in the spread of condoms, one or two of which have been given to us, now they give us hundreds of packages, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" It's a popular question, with drive and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms not only be behind the benches and that hundreds of them be in the machines in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
This is not a promotion of loose conduct.
It was not about paying for beer and a motel, said Governor Emilio González when he was asked whether condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
“It is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms accessible to those who are already engaging in sexual activity”, he noted.
Key data in Halisco
13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been reported.
The State ranks 4th in the national rating for new and aggregate AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92 per cent of infections are sexual, 6 per cent blood and 2 per cent perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision which annuls the restructuring of the Vitro Group debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a year-long precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has capacity to pay.
The procedures for supporting the survival of firms permitted by Mexican laws do not appear to be valid in the country of strips and stars, in contravention of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the judgement rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico for referral to the United States Supreme Court, giving evidence of three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge points out that creditors should be governed by the US bankruptcy code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern competition proceedings before Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was established to that end, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had taken place in front of the Mother's Vitro branch, a majority would not have been reached to approve restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of the branches, Vitro creditors who fought against it in United States courts, namely, the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencea, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal dismisses these data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that he has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has experienced in striking the country.
So far, the González Sad family will appeal to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote will reach its plenary, i.e. five judges, because only three have voted.
In case of failure, a certificate will be submitted that will require review by the Supreme Court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“the other court”) describing the process followed by Vitro in the framework of the Competition Act, signaling that it was exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established in cases of inter-State insolvency which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
A two-board carball: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In view of the months-long complaints filed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the Trade Union Association of Air Operators has already discovered a bottleneck.
The authority led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General ' s Office on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares by the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Askarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
At the weekends at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the establishment of a broad front against the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of isolated-country products, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra had been able to bring together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that levelled part of the protected territories and posed serious threats against industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government's rejection of the Senate's request to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Counterparty Trade Agreement, known as the Abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case had already gone to the archives.
As you know, action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of treating it as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to settle long-term debt without affecting short-term housing, the Homex builder places 500 million pesos in the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, offering interest every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
The NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the trade name Competival, has just come to light and will aim at the market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Heatin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector Hetin Reyes, a busy basketball traveler, has been involved in this sport for over 60 years, and he has been around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was taken to sports for more than 60 years, as a small-class player, as a high-ball player, as an authorized and BSN leader with the Bayman Cowboys and the president of the Federation of Basketball.
“I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was President of BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to Primera Hora’s home in Bayamon, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and monuments collected during his long journey, show this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he preserves those who remember his way through the Cowboys, beginning in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or an agent of the contract.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey debuted in BSN.
Since then, Kuco Ortis, who was a great administrator, has continued to lead," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was headed here and was at Alabama University (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Would you like to?"
And that was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bart then recommended a sniper named Raymond Gauss, who became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey had won the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By then, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and his achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. championship in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we won fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the U.S. Army, which was quite similar to the one we won at the world championship.
Not only were Minsie, Gaussa, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortisa) again, but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 1990s because of knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in staff, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like 'Canito' Nyeves, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for the players temporarily removed for disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Picculine Ortiz.
Its performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking into account his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like Leo Ariel's work very much.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous period of the National Assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s there were up to 17 teams in BSN in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce should play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my era on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren, and I rarely go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Larry Hagman's actor died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his primary role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas TV series, where he made a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnetist J.R. Ewing in Dallas TV, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in the new season of Dallas, died on Friday night because of cancer complications, according to a statement by the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the sign role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in Sikvel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, loving, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of the orderly character in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl named Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included roles well accepted by critics, in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colours".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the awe - inspiring J.R. that led Hagman to the height of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create noises around the episode, full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, produced international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers' offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience at the time.
When a response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million tellers watched it and turned Dallas into the second edition of the entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Christine, who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an unsatisfying corrupter with a charismatic smile: an unfair businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed for treatment.
"I know what must be on the J.R. gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also a hero of the original show, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "great, both on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas edition were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement on what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actresses and singers Mary Martin, who sparkled in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s and then served in the England Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I would consider capable of hurting anyone or affecting them in any way," said Prensa Association at the time.
After liver transplants, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
We're starting a course that explores "The End of Light"
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when Stuart Sharma, a professor of religion, decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible lure: the end of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which had been captured by many people as proof of the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: a catastrophic hurricane named Sandy, a financial crisis that some call "long-armageddon", and a growing conflict that Israel would involve, a place where Christian theorists at the end of time believe that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, it's bad for those who have an apocalyptic mind.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Professor Barry Vacker reads the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We are analysing why these ideas are spreading over time,” he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios suggest certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I tried to tell the students that it was probably possible and impossible," said Walker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called “The End of the World”.
"We do not add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the world does not come," Restall said.
Despite “imminent destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the canoe of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night that the end of the world is supposed to come”, Restall said.
Courses were pretty popular.
"The cities ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average score of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there was any room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is just a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and sisterhood, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected Maya's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple from West Chester.
Maya had never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which is centuries old, where people respond to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English - speaking world.
Joseph Dogherty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course on the end of the world there.
“Philippiness do not participate at the end of the world”, he wrote, implying the authority of the higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last court had been mentioned for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers shall be treated with respect to that date.
Some said they were going to the end-of-the-light parties.
"Maybe I'll call someone from my friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old liaison student.
