Semirski v. Procurator's Office: the cassation of former Deputy Mayor Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided on in early September.
The courts of the first two courts dismissed Semilarski ' s claim, but in April, he accepted his appeal of cassation in the proceedings of the State Court.
The Court of Justice of Tartu returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019 because its authorization was not within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court ' s ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Court of departure should regulate such matters”, ERR previously explained to the media secretary of the Courts of Tartu Annette Kreitsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski appealed the order before the district court, which on 5 February did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the word of the Lord will have to be said.
According to lawyer Semirski, juror lawyer Oliver Nees, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office refute the false allegations and compensate him for the moral damage.
The complaint was due to the statements made by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lyon District Prosecutor ' s Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semirski, along with the other Deputy Mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“It will be recalled that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor ' s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential authorities of local self-government, were sellers.
These public suspicions hanging in the air have accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Prosecutor's Office does not want to say anything about it," Semirski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor ' s office should operate.
“The claim of bribes and sales proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and on Lithuania that, during the investigation phase, State representatives should be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not respected in this case against Valvo Semirski," Nees said.
“The public perception of Semirski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, counsel added.
As wrote by Russ.err.ee, former Deputy Mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held accountable for the alleged bribery - the criminal proceedings against him were partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official was charged with deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in dealing in a particularly large way.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city administration in decisions involving companies operating in Tartu with owners or leaders of Semirski who were actively associated at a personal level in non-working time.
According to Grossa, Semirski had personal interests in all of these cases, and therefore had to be removed from taking part in the decision-making process.
Earlier, as wrote by rus.err.ee, the Prosecutor ' s Office had raised Semira ' s suspicions of bribery and violation of anti-corruption legislation in dealing in a particularly large way.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained with other Deputy Mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice-presidents.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov ' s case later came to trial, which fully justified politics.
The Valvo Semirski trial is still ongoing.

Support me with the dedicated Handy Up fans, "We don't need a new baby."

How the CB's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by a further 0.25 percentage point, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual, formal, historical minimum.
Judging from the return of a short step towards lowering the rate, as well as the tonality of the CB statements and the updated projections for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistically than ever.
This means that the current monetary policy mitigation cycle can soon be stopped.
“We continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that inflation risks remain below 4 per cent in 2021,” reported Bank of Russia head Elvir Nabillin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabilina said, would take over a year and a half.
At the same time, it noted that economic processes had revived following the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment demand, construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and the annual rate of decline in transport, production had slowed.
According to the CB, the decline in the economy in 2020 was 4.5-5.5% (up to 4-6%) and the recovery growth in 2021 was 3.5-4.5%, while in 2022 it was 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The CB used to expect $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the projected inflation of the Bank of Russia for 2020 was 3.7-4.2 per cent against the previously expected 3.8-4.8 per cent.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, economists for Russia and CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donetsz and Andrey Melachenko view.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
At the last meeting, CB reduced it to one percentage point in June because of low inflation due to the demand for demand and the need to stimulate the pandemic and its constraints.
The chances of monetary policy updating remain (at the next meeting, on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the limit is close, according to Chief Analyst Rosbanka Evgeny Koshev.
The combination of inflationary risks also indicates the nearness of a break in the reduction of interest-rate policies - broken supply chains, the possible increase in costs due to prevention measures and faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he said.
To complete the subsequent action, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatility increased in the light of geopolitical conflicts, says Koseljev.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will further reduce the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly the mortgage, says Senior Economist of the Open Bank Analyst Maksim Petrovic.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.
The demand rates may fall by an additional 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, the mortgage rates may end in the range of 6.2 to 7 per cent, and the BSS Prime Minister ' s economist Anton Pokatovic will not exclude.

In this respect, the passage of the latest series of small Soviet rocket ships along the Admiralte Coast was removed.
The main naval parade was broadcast by Russia 1 and Russia.tv.
Earlier, on 24 June, at a parade in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory, the camera went from one plan to another “passed” through a tank duo inside the armored car, and during the flight of the Russian Knights and Stripes pilots, the camera “disembarked” from the plane's engine.

Question: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens has again led party ratings
Lithuania's Union of Farmers and Greens, which heads the Seimas Coalition, led the party's rating.
This was demonstrated by a survey conducted by the company of social studies in the Vilmorus Por Order of the newspaper Lietuvos ritas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the “Christians” lost their first place and led Russia's main critic in Lithuania for a long time, the opposition “Union of Fatherland – Christian Democrats (Conservators).
However, recently, President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, assessing the electoral potential of the parties, said that the Union of Farmers and Greens, following the parliamentary elections this year, would probably be able to re-establish a coalition.
This statement has caused the resentment of the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were to take place today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for farmers and 17.2 per cent would vote for conservatives.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Heidis, the breakout was within error, and yet the rulers stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Heidis, the sociological success of the “Christians” has been facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Svernalis.
This politician was the first on the list of “Christians” and in the 2016 elections.
Thirdly, the Social Democratic Party is now ready to vote for 7.1 per cent of respondents.
For me, she suddenly lost 2 percent.
Fourth - Labour Party led by Russian businessman Viktor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
The other political organizations, according to the survey, are still unable to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Non-requirements for State purchases shall be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for procurement requests.
In the autumn session of the plenary session, the Gosdumas planned to consider, on second reading, a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in procurement, to which only entities of small and medium-sized enterprises could participate.
Amendments are made by the Government to the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Legal Persons.
The draft law has been developed on the road map for the implementation of the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Strategy in the RF by 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that the contracting authorities are entitled to require from the procurement participants, entities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
As well as a list of requirements for those documents.
To date, the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Individual Legal Persons provides a framework for the procurement of individual legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, form and composition of the procurement bid shall be established by the purchasers themselves in the procurement documentation.
“As a result, the contracting authorities shall impose excessive requirements on the content, presentation of the application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates that are comparable to the date of submission of the applications to the competent authorities, which makes it impossible to participate in such procurement and to reduce the number of purchasers”, explains the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that the contracting authorities are entitled to require from the procurement participants involved in small and medium-sized enterprises.
“The adoption of a document will prevent the clients from arbitrarily establishing requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are entities of small and medium-sized enterprises”, the explanatory note states.

Also during the interview, a problem was raised with a 30% reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing company of milk in favour of agricultural farms.
As a result, the share of cooperators’ intakes has decreased.
The head of the region commissioned the acting Minister of Agriculture to move to the area, examine the milk structure, analyse the experiences of other Territories and identify options for solving the problem.

Sub-Moscow authorities have reported on the fate of closed landfills
Solid household waste ranges continue to be closed in Submask.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that exist are being upgraded to modern waste treatment facilities.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have abandoned a dense residential structure.
Once the polygon is closed, it rises to reclamation - the polygon's body is intertwined with soil, degasation and infiltration systems are mounted.
This allows the chemical processes to be stopped inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, cause an outbreak, poison the soil and groundwater.
Then the former dumpster continues to be elevated to a useless dog in the midst of its habitable construction.
Why don't you make her something useful?
For example, in Ruze, where the reclamation of the Annino site literally ended on days, authorities are considering making the mountain slope out of a pile.
This range, operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the process of recycling, it was necessary to repurchase adjacent sites, de facto, that had long since been buried in garbage.
"For a while, the "sit down" polygon will gain strength, and we'll think what we can do to get it to benefit.
Directly in front of the eyes is a mountain resort," the head of the Russian district, Nikolai Parfenov, told reporters.
Two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbejevo ranges in Lubertz and Timohovo in the Bogorod Region will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, Torbeeva will launch a gas-discharge power plant capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of heat energy, which will provide its own needs - the provision of administrative and production facilities.
Timochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
A museum may be established in the “Cucino” Balachishin range, which was closed after complaints by residents on the “Direct Line” with the President of the country.
“It was such an idea to create a museum for the recycling of Podmoskovya sites”, said the Government's advance Minister of Environment and Environmental Management of Dmitry Kurakin.

What bound the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week is 87 years from the date of the Treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
A document signed a few months after Hitler came to power was the basis on which relations between the Holy See and the Fascists were built.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Aya Sofia
Once again, about Aya-Sofia, the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance. Hooray!
I've never been to Istanbul, but God's house is better free of charge than it is paid.
Secondly, Muslims have conquered the land as honestly as the Orthodox have conquered the Volgo-Oksa River, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozno) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to bring it all back to everyone?
You don't think there'll be any pagans who'll need to get their captors back to where the Tenth Church is?
Thirdly, Muslims improved the building, invested funds in it.
So it's just like the factories and mansions that the Lenins took from the bourgeois in their possession, they belong to the Lenins, the Putins, and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their right to progress.
The beautiful high minarets have decorated Aya Sofia very much.
There was a stupid nun, she became a stupid nun with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “ Orthodox” civilizations.
There are those who believe, and there are hypocrites, and there are those who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
It's the thought of an official of the British Midas Toynby who believes in such a shame to think.
And to those who believe there is a place of prayer.
And always.
A believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave, but he is removed from another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're hats, not rocks.

President of the Russian Football Union (RFS) Alexander Dukov believes that it is wrong to extend the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at present.
"First, it was the decision of the PPL, but I agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.

I knew Bryant's selfishness couldn't be bullied by some kind of thrashing so as not to stimulate his sports rage.
Kobi had the killer's instinct, so I tried to talk him out of playing the aggressive key.
I gave him a compliment on the playground: "Oh!
Kobi, well killed, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that he had to take the ball and score another three to four points.
We have had a good time with Kobi," Kirilenko says, "Evening Moscow."

For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration of the legend I saw on TV alone.

Soon I walked away from the excitement. I covered his earrings a couple of times.
In that game, my team won, and Jordan scored 44 points," added the head of the RFB.

An actor in the Russian series responded to allegations of “LGBT propaganda and feminism”
An actor in the Russian series "Chiki", the creators of which were accused of "advocacy of LGBT and feminism", responded to the film's claims.
The authors "understanded the harshness of the subject and did not want to offend anyone", said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in a conversation with the edition of "Ascension".
"I think it's a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was “proud of work” and did not view it as propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was intimidated by the reaction of some people to the story line of the show: for example, there was a case where “a man in a deep spot shot the site and said it was not true.”
"Then there were a few times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who initially came with the claims began to help us," he summed it up.
The shooting incident, explains the issue, took place in Cabardino-Balcaria in September 2019: a drunk man attacked a shooting squad car and was subsequently detained by police officers.
Earlier, it was reported that a public prosecutor for the protection of the Olga Baranez family had filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roscomnadzor for the service more.tv, which placed the Russian series "Chiki".
The Ombudsman accused the creators of the series of “advanced non-traditional sexual relations and feminism”, noting that the main heroines of the film work as prostitutes and the series itself contains “sensive physical and psychological violence”.
The Ombudsman was also upset by the fact that “the series paid a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation” by the minor.
Chiki's comedy drama tells of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on a friend's advice.
