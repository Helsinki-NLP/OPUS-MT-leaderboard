Barack Obama gets the fourth American president of the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be awarded, inter alia, for an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief will fly into the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and with Michelle's wife, and he'll have an emergency.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The Presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
This afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth president of the United States, but only the third price he gets right in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking the price as president, who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago further increased by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to stress any of its critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
They're going to give you for charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The charged programme of the President will then take him to a banquet, where there will be also the Prime Minister and 250 other guests invited, apart from the Norwegian King and Queen.
Obama was more of a slow person from the beginning to the price.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not only for him but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "a challenge to action".
Protector of Nature Accused of Extortion
The Litomer Police accused the president of the Civil Association of the Society of Protectors of the Nature of Litomerica of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawal of the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said L.A. Police Spokesman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litomeric Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studnica.
Now he's in custody and he's in danger for up to three years in prison.
Brno's sorting containers don't smell very good.
In Prague, ordinary people can order the packaging from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will again meet the sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to buy yourself a few minutes before you find a suitable dumpster.
I don't want to argue that in Brno, waste wouldn't be treated at all.
But it seems to me that we are not interested enough in being the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the forest’s waste sorting league not only by throwing paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers as citizens, but mainly by the number of dumpsters for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing PET bottles into a collection basket in the center?
It's a ready-to-be godfather. It's all about time and nerves.
The only place I've hit so far is in Moravian Square across the street from Spotted Hose.
Don't let Mr. Onderka get mad at me with her colleagues, but I don't feel like it.
Not to mention there's no honey in other parts.
A lot of my friends don't like to do waste.
It's lazy.
They've got it far to the dumpsters.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw out a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored garbage cans on Kounice Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on my way to the saloon.
However, the waste flowed from it.
It's still the center of Brno, which the city represents the most, isn't it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics may not be of much interest to Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey extra, which would make us ashamed all over the Republic than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my opinion after a moment of online smoldering with official statistics.
According to ECO-COM, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravian region.
Paroubkov's budget took money for pensions and the hospital
After the left has added, despite the opinion of the government, to farmers or officials, there may not be any money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction.
But also interest on sovereign debt or international litigation.
It will add problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduardo Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted promotions to some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions or sick government to further lend themselves. "It is just a delay in problems to the future, laying mines," Janota says.
The money borrowed is paying more and more, and sometimes it has to come back.
He doesn't have much choice where to take it.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or costs of the State's course, it must raise taxes.
All to whom she has now added left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
Retirement or sickness, which accounted for 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry about getting it.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted – next year it will not be only 163 billion but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow more rapidly and with him also the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or to reduce maternal income, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
For the benefit of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the construction of motorways and railways.
This is mainly about already over-stretched and dismantled sections, which are not cost-effective to redesign.
Make the most of it, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major buildings, also threatening to draw European money, warns Minister of Transport Karel Hanselka.
ČSSD proposed that the loss of money will be resolved by Shalamounski – it reaches into the CEZ dividends, which the state of most of its own, and from them it will contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from the CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP under EU rules.
But that doesn't end the movement carnival.
Nearly three billion have been budgeted for various damages to victims of communism and crime or for spending on judicial disputes, even for construction aid.
If this money doesn't work, it's not safe.
That's the lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it the same way, says Janot.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or at worst reach for the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already launched two billion project State Treasury, which is designed to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janot warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and transfer from Windows Mobile in a few seconds to Android.
This is exactly the option that American VMware is targeting, which focuses mainly on developing virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to run two user profiles at once on your cell phone.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into domestic and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware indicated in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November of last year and was presented a few days ago for the first time.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, on which Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and should reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes don't just worry the Giants.
The missing snow also repels people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkonoše they are still able to get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our website.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas will be snow or mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants a silvestrov stay in Spindler's Mill should no longer hesitate to order.
Whoever prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler's hoteliers are offering mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're gonna try to turn them in for a while, but then they're gonna let it go for a little while.
And then the free rooms will quickly be destroyed," Jandura estimated.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Ingtours Regional Travel Office.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
Half the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Director Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoše can offer the top-level travel agency as well, but the vacancies are less.
The first 14 days of February go well, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People wait for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas will also be sold," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is better than last year to accommodate the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better at this.
We've got last few seats on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is good for sale," said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada.
Of the 80 percent, the hotel Omnia is also occupied with Silvestrov's stay at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half the beds are available in the newest Jano Spa Hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the January, which we have now occupied about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow strikes, interest in stays in Krkonoše will certainly rise even further, said Hotel Director Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater part of the snow, the Krkonoše hoteliers must still taste.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday, if there's any precipitation, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then there is the warming to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeating Is the Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It is comical, with what educational effort Barack Obama, the president with the greatest reputation, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his long - awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copy of the Bush Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he uses the word "as in Iraq" several times, but he did not hesitate to use the name Busha's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
Yet he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military troops to Iraq under the grip of civil war as "unresponsible and in consequence catastrophic decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the Polish commanders was the only possible and most successful one, so much so that today, in reporting on Iraq, they are not talking at all.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was again asked by the field commanders to increase the military contingent, in particular Chief of Operation Stanley McCristal of Afghanistan, who, even in spite of the subordinary custom, severely criticised the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he was no better off, so at least he tricked the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to claim the promise of another 5,000, even though he himself originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will produce the same fruit as the Iraqi procedure.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are badly prepared to change masters on a daily basis as they please.
Political institutions, even though formally established, will remain only a post-war village, where patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex due to the lack of transparency of the ratios that further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an "action state", which is a minimalist goal of the entire operation, doesn't seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy strikes with its volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to a war cry for the "fast return home" will cause a miracle done here, only souls can truly be romantic, in reality intact.
From a political point of view, the date of withdrawal of troops is clear of irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
NATO's last summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is going downhill.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war on the Hindukush floor.
Another factor capable of radically interfering with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will face a difficult question if it does not try to resolve the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered at the very time when America is about to embark on a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to Obama.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain in the presidential elections, and therefore enough time is left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers won't get any more cash rewards.
The senior executives of the US Bank Goldman Sachs won't get a cash prize this year.
It was announced by a company that responds to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading managers will get instead of the money stock that will be available for sale in five years at the earliest.
In addition, actions may be taken from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to Reuters, faces an effort to link the awards to Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to be issued, said former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became a target of criticism after she gave nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) to the party during the first three quarters of this year.
The total remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political issue with the coming financial crisis in a number of countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a 50 per cent tax on the bonuses of bankers of more than £25,000 (about CZK712,000).
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today took over with the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf this year’s Nobel prizes in professional categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists among them was German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Prize for Medicine along with their countryman Jack Shostak for their chromosome research.
Israel’s Ada Jonathan, along with the Americans Venkatram Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received a prize for chemistry for explaining the structure and functions of the ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize for the economy that American Elinor Ostromová and her countryman Oliver Williamson had won for the analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around without a hostess this year was physics.
This prize was taken today by scientists Charles As a research in optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyl for the invention of a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each of the awarded received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns for each category (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more in each of them, they share the reward.
Traditionally, American President Barack Obama received the highest Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his path and is also at the head of a country that is leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to combat peace, even though the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering demis. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus will welcome Mr Eduard Janota, Minister of Finance, on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget for the following year, as approved by the Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meeting.
The budget criticises Klaus as well.
According to him, it has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by President Radim Ochvat.
On Monday, Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jane Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, which Klaus is about to receive for signature, the Czech Republic should manage the 163 billion koruna deficit.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed on the left-hand proposals for money transfers and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government referred to social democracy's proposals by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, there was a sharp intra-polythic dispute, which began to raise a question about the further action of Fischer's office, on which the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party agreed to form in spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as the House adopted it, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government imposed in the autumn and which it believes will stop the state's indebtedness.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the State Budget Act, announced at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem" of "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
Improvement could only bring about a strong government that could also rely on a wider consensus of political parties, the president says.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and the government should consider another existence.
Deputy President of ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words in response as "strong statements".
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánka by saying that the terrible deficit of the budget, which the former Topolánka government has prepared for this year, will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the Czech Republic designated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela was playing Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggles and victories despite some critics that the major roles are being played by American actors.
The story tells of sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandel.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story is Oscar's American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 19-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said to him, "If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
A 70 - year - old actor who won the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama of the Million Dollar Baby Box has already created, for example, a leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even a god in Divine Evan, but only rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work in the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the name of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pinaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite football players who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually join the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I printed out your hand, I took your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon appears in the film Françoise Pienaara, captain of the national football team, where white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the tough world of football.
A big surprise to him at last was when he first met Pinaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened the doorbell, and the first thing I said to François Pinaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual proposals under the direction of Eastwood director, Invictus received: Unbeatable positive reviews and is also talking about the ambitions of Oscar.
Film critic Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the film reviews on the web site rottenomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of the positive reviews.
The secret of the glare over Norway is spread: the Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the start was again unsuccessful and the arrow marked as the type of "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in rocket tests had a proper effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, the boulevard didn't take off or get hurt in the air.
The Russian newspapers already refer to "Bulava" as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This one in the order of the 13th trial was going on at the beginning of normal.
At the end of the flight, technical damage to the apparatus occurred again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom submarine Dmitri Donski, which sailed under the white sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians haven't questioned the Russian missile since the first time.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that failure cannot be spoken of clearly.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident hit three.
In the preceding cases, engines were disrupted immediately in the first degree.
Although not one test start has taken place without a mistake, only six out of thirteen sees the Ministry of Defence as a failure.
The general's nearly 50 percent success is therefore optimistic, and he still claims that "Bulava" will fly once without problems and that it will even hijack up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract in CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be reintroduced at 51 years of age in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will assist in the distress of his team CSKA Moscow and will appear in Friday's KHL duel against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career in his 40s in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Dennis Kuljaš is injured, we need another defenseman.
Fetisov is training regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formalities, quoted by AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei Germanova.
So far, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey game will be about just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, said Germanov.
Fetisov thus, according to the AP, will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in case of return to ice.
In the NHL he played at the age of one and a half the season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold, seven world championships, he triumphed at Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he collected successes in the NHL, where in the Detroit jersey he raised twice over Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey hall of fame.
Hyundai met with the trade unions, cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai's carrier car has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the many overtimes that the union declared on Monday an emergency strike.
This was confirmed by the car speaker Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday December 19th with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
Server Sevenka.cz wrote that the company employees who work Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
They'll get people back on Saturday the 28th of November.
According to Vaník, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated over time.
Either they have to pay the extra for overtime or they can choose a spare holiday on December 28th, and by that time they can extend Christmas holidays for the day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid fares and lunches.
Since overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from unionists, including protestors, who stopped production on a daily basis last week, the management decided, with immediate effect, to cancel any overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Automobile employees were forced to spend an extra two hours each day after an eight - hour shift.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions shall withdraw the alert.
Further discussions between driving and trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Chief of Staff Petr Chef said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car deteriorated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that overtime has to be made by employees to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
The experts also requested that no sanctions should be imposed on staff members who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions ask the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
Plus, this year they want to pay the reward of 5,000 crowns.
The Hyundai Nošovska car now employs 2,000 people.
The company launched its serial production in November last year.
By September this year, she had produced about 80,000 cars, with the current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects the 'deprived' of HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of an improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already acquired against medicines of immunity.
This fact in some cases predominates that the compound does not act as strongly as some medicines already available.
AIDS can't be cured yet.
However, patients may significantly prolong the life of a combination of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of virus replication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metallic carbonate affect the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metal carbonates are compounds of pine, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the medicines used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalcarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages made up of pine, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by an atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A Reliable and Resilient Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV, mature viral particles would not be eliminated.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of HIV protease agents has been tested in the study and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metal carborates on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinical medicines, but it does not lose its effect on resistant variants which are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also its other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments from metal carbs makes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlín Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument about the budget. ODS went to Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek marked the approved budget for next year as "frightening" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The ODS statement was referred to by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
Mr Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the CzechSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Neča, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in the House on the minority involved in the fight against the growing deficit or whether he is in a position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The access of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, said Nečas.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than CZK 12 billion.
The House raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's outpouring of social democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage the 163 billion koruna deficit.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, thus meeting the Government's wishes that the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would still assess the situation.
It is timeless to believe that if Janota seriously threatened to leave office if amendments were adopted, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered a prime minister's appointment Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering a further stay in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is his reason.
If Fischer speaks out for the next fight against the budget deficit, according to Neča, they do not have in the government what to do with the CzechSSD nominees, which has pushed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will grant a demission if the House approves further laws of deficits that increase, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or the amendment of the service law.
Topolanek: ODS nominees not guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominees did nothing wrong, pointed out Topolánek in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that at several ministries, there are people in the post of deputy, who voted against the budget for TOP 09.
In time, he stressed that if Fischer decides to give up on the principle of combating the high deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House".
Then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, so I'm going to do it, I told the press in the House, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated by the civil democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer left for the European Council's meeting in Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister of the Civil Democrats did not explicitly request that they allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, and he responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiation of the budget did not make it difficult for the president of the party to be present in the Czech Republic and Parliament.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
As long as I had given up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily the Bolshevikisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new order, ČD will take less trains for almost the same ride
Since 13 December, Czech roads will cancel or restrict some less burdened speedboats and localities, while other connections will strengthen.
From the date of entry into force of the new timetable, the total transport volume will be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, do not change.
For example, the people of Ostrava will be able to connect more to the capital, and the roads add one set of pendolinos to this track.
On the contrary, the speedboat will stop going to Bratislava.
Less speeders will also go on the track Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice, the direct connections of Prague - Letohrad will be substantially limited.
From the regions they plan to reduce transport in the Královéhradecký region by a total of eight percent, the opposite can be enjoyed by Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several speedboats on the track Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to just a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes are the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovicte must cross in Lysé above Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban system of Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station target station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka/Jeseník will take two-hour intervals.
Since 13 December, the passengers will no longer be bound by Pendolin to Bratislava.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport is ordering and paying four billion crowns to pay for the so-called evidentiary losses next year, as well as this year. The localities are ordering the regions, paying a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion countries contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a new ten-year contract for the locals and the speedboats, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The track system boasts, and it is clear that it has not increased the prices of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will take place only for one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be new from the lost distance, so far it has been one and 160 crowns for the journey between any regional cities.
Filipino armed men are still holding over 50 people, Children released
Today, armed forces abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several elementary - school students and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the AFP, which originally informed only 65 of the kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men claim to be using hostages as a living shield on the run from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police initially pursued the kidnapper because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed declared martial law.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to elections to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
To suspect participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Filipino province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The JAR story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Unbeatable), which captures part of the life story of the former president of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was hosted by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself had chosen for his creation years ago.
The other male role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby Francoise Pinaara was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the film, they rise from the voices of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
All on behalf of Nelson Rollihlah Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received Sachar’s prize for freedom of thought, and in 1993 he and de Klerk received the Nobel Prize of Peace.
He was president of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great expectation, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the world football championship are being made in the South African Republic, but at the same time the media is shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the people of the Montenegrin ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the announcements for a new film in the JAR for the time being are quite positive, despite numerous reservations about the placement of the main roles by Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film, according to his words.
I've dreamed of that role for years, and I've prepared well for it.
I also met with Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, draw his energy from the interview after the premiere of the movie in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind Mandel's personality and message.
It's a story of the South African Republic, but it's about every human being, he added.
In the training of the national team rugby
Photo based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated title In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African defender of human rights during his first presidential election period.
So, during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to stamp out two racial and long years of mutually defined population groups, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also takes part in the acting role in South Africa's national rugby jersey at the World Cup Course, which was then won by JAR.
For entering the grass in the jersey, which is considered almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela collected 14 years ago a large ovation mostly of the white audience and gained recognition of the white population.
Football Championships may be able to reunite people into one nation, said a rugby player named Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
If the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, for example, as a recent LN interview showed by a rugby fan named Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
There's a transformer burning in Lounland for tens of millions of crowns
The fire took place in the morning of the transformer of the company Čeps in the spa near the village of Vyskov in Lounsk.
According to the spokesman for the oral district firefighter Lukaš Marvan, six units intervene in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later the opinion was re-evaluated and the fire extinguished the mixture of water, foam and special fire materials.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal shortening of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident according to Pavly Mandat's spokesman does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, exactly how it will be calculated after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one, according to Mandata.
In ten years, nothing like this has happened to Chaps; the defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to CEZ spokesman for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the power supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or companies, the fire of the traffic station did not affect.
A.s. Čeps operates in the territory of the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a route of guidance of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for conspiring against three Czech citizens from the Czech Federation
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today's criminal notice for conspiring against three socio-democratic hejtmans.
This is for Michal Hasek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubic Region and the Hejtman of the Olomouc Region of Martin Tesarík.
Jančura said it in 20 minutes of the radio station.
The lawsuit relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
All regions, however, eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three Haytmans are attacking us and talking about we're picking raisins, and we've only brought an offer of what we wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech roads, which is not true because we know the prices of Czech roads that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's for gossiping about Student Agency, said Radiojournal Jančura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they had not acted in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the submission of a criminal notice to be a follow-up to Mr Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and my country and the same challenge for the other Haytmans.
I suppose, even on this occasion, it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will alert the countries to an unfavourable step.
The radio station said the Christmas campaign would stop and continue after New Year's Eve.
He made it clear that the campaign would be directed against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and the CZK 150 billion did not sign tenders for the contract.
According to Jančura, similar proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions Jančur said he was threatened by a member of the Czech Republic.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know what master he's about, I won't say his name, said Radiojournal Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcals from January will break the usual practice.
It's supposed to be the first one for families to be free and optional at the same time.
However, there are already voices calling for mandatory vaccination to be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are peaks.
The medical institute already sets maximum vaccine prices to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts also have a clear understanding of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Since January, children who were born last August 2nd and later can be expected free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, she volunteered to let her children inoculate a quarter of the families against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But they will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, about 500,000 a year has been given to the state for all of the vaccinations of children.
The vaccine was administered by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumocococcal causes middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain blanches and blood poisoning.
In the case of pneumocococcal infections, in the course of the year, according to the investigation in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 years of age will die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children have been given flat-rate vaccinations against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are indications that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it is to be covered by insurance companies and optional.
That mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, was suggested by the head of the civil society, Nalas Rudolf Kalovský.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long promoted.
Experts at the international conference, which our associations participated in, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in pushing at least this forward.
I think that's the way we have to get on now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcals.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
The President of the Expert Society of Practical Child Doctors, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that he has the benefit of voluntary vaccination.
If all children were to be vaccinated, a reduction in the number of vaccinations could be considered "For the situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand fairly the political decision that the vaccination was initiated as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect that more than 80 percent of fresh parents will be vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also breakthrough in the fact that, as the first flat vaccination of children, health insurance companies pay for it, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save money on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves.
However, this is due to the concerns of practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplied the substances to other vaccines.
Some Members feared, however, that this could "take money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for insurance companies to pay them off.
It is estimated that individual practitioners will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, Cabrnoch says.
The son of an American artist 's been stealing from the museum'
The son of renowned American fictionist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, celebrated himself with the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press Press.
The AP quoted the unnamed police officer as saying that Mr Frazetta, Jr., could be motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Prior to the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger forthcoming statement, 52 years of age, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move the images to the sweetening rooms", the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied any such permission, as the agency said.
Labourists prevent planned tax increases
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Torys "lost" the opportunity to show that they seriously postpone the decision to reduce deficit until after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly about an increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and a 1 % adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Anger with regard to social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession they had not committed and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is about 3 trillion pounds per year - which has disrupted the business community that said it was a tax on employment while it should focus on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to these revenues of more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0,5 % from April 2011
The economic situation is expected to worsen by 4,75 % this year
New tax of 50 % of the bonuses of bankers
Increase in 1% tax on write-off companies in small companies
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind power plants
Retirement increase by 2,5 %
According to the State Financial Administration, some revenue of £30,000 will decrease by £90 per year and some revenue of £40,000 will decrease by £190, while some revenue of £10000 will increase by £110.
The Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the specific taxes should be on 5% of the top-income people.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be "a cap in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They are large numbers, which will allow us to reduce deficit by half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise the previous amounts.
In his opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5 % decline forecasted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Wasted opportunity'
The conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning against the Labour Debt Crisis, marked the planned 789 billion pounds loan over the next six years as unsustainable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan to make it worth living, added, "cynic" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money generated by tax hikes and spending cuts should be used to support expenditure next year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay taxes in the next April - that this could lead to an indictment by the Chancellor in the electoral campaign if the money was made difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies reported that the Chancellor's figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come only after the elections if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte's revirator of accounts.
"This was a report on a suspicious provisional budget. The markets are implementing it."
FBI's investigating 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating a prison in Pakistan with five Americans suspected of contacting extremists.
The men were imprisoned for assaulting a house in Sargoda, eastern Panjab province, according to the BBC Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who had been declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are said to be from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," spokeswoman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
It was said that the house was always the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, Reuters reported, but said that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the expansion of the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from their homes in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian bullies.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, as reported in the Amnesty International Group's report.
The report describes in detail the "effects of torture" in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected the above criticism of this human rights report.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were held in custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, High Leader Ayatolah Ali Homejný had declared that some methods of torture were wrong and banned them from being carried out in the Karizak Correctional Facility.
Since then, however, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent put it.
Untrue confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer technician Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and protesting against the results of the elections.
"Frequently beat me in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days he signed an untrue confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian senior government officials denied the rape charges, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who stated that he had been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate electoral unrest and government reactions, but stated that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group stated that at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to transform the monument in Bristol into a sailing track for the race.
The slope track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the rowway in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump bridge 100 metres away from the long rowway.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the rowway, but that it was really a callous one.
It was a beautiful view of the city's shining lights down there.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the sailing track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Could he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called after the ban on the construction of minerals and, in general, there are alarming reports of the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and considered whether Muslims can integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the most open secular societies in the continent.
After reading this book, some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why don't the French like scarves on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on the issues they have been sharing and employing the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a much broader and more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the heart.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now care for 5⁄6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that most concern them.
Should Muslim enter the marriage union in the mosque or in the town hall (or in both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslim woman marry a man who is not Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interestingly oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
These seem to be the world's controversial issues that are under discussion, which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, does not exclude Tarik Ramadan, Araba, a Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no argument for all their customs.
The conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists Mr Bowen interviewed are drawn to the belief that this is the anti-polo Selafi – supporters of Purist Sunni Islam, grouped in Saudi Arabia – this group is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so stubbornly defends the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
The view is that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with the secular republic.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "covering the screws of values".
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Most Comfortable Prospects
The Arctic is changing faster than the rest of the planet's environment.
Restrictive ice conceals alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when awakening them.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practice of whale fishing describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to empower the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a round of muskets is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently murdered mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, suddenly there were 75 polar bears in a circus tent.
Even today, the zoos have a typical area of a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
When you click here you will find more!
Mr Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and they are all armed with powerful attack towels that shoot their prey.
Ironically, it is happening in water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On the Ice" Alan Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomforted responsibility of science for the Arctic and a seductive summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Not even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the pace of change.
It's for lack of testing.
The exploration journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated the movement of floating ice.
The cold war submarines then mapped the moving overcasts as they sailed.
Satellite survey and extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to unhindered individuals camped in winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking into the extremely fragile world of the collapsing system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that shrinks during freezing.
But from the height of that bear to microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed to extinction as soon as summer ice moves, which will sometimes take place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 Marines laid a wreath on the tombs of Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and other Marines who took a trip from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville to North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, that was the day on which they gave up holding men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I try.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay the wreaths on the cemetery veterans in several departments during the Friday act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the Friday act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife, Karen, take this journey every year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, the wreaths across America, which they place in other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths in the Arlington Cemetery, in the Pentagon, on the cemetery at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial site of flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart’s foundation has devoted more than $150,000 to the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of getting back what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloths, volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for older graves from World War I and World War II and from the Vietnam War because these were not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the gravestones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch of bees upper part.
Close to the section 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, has remained truly quiet.
The United Services Organisation devoted 1,000 wreaths to the decoration of the department, but the gloomy mood of the war was filling this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the cold air.
Some read the names aloud, carved into stones, while others tended to look at small black and white nouns pressed into wet mud where gravestones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit David Shane Spicer's last resort, a gunnery sergeant who fell in a fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... ..my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, according to foreign ministry officials on Saturday.
The supplier, who had not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was detained on December 5.
Certain charges have not been published, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical acts, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about her and her husband being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to take over the prices, but her permission was denied.
Detaining an American supplier may be a result of growing tension between the Communist Castro brother, who reigns in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been seen as a "maintenance tactic" in improving relations with the island.
First, they reported the New York Times prison Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government took concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States would take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a public employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send text messages because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are behind bars for hard acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, U.S. Press Office for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Prisons and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American programme of the Human Rights Implementation Group, who recently published an unfavourable report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raula Castro as leader of the country and the replacement for the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants are often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would rather be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani officials of the state administration are covering a conspiracy concerning the dispatch of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities unveiled the alleged leader of the conspiracy concerning the dispatch of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of American troops, and said they hoped that this case could help cover a wide network of terrorist recruits who were tracking the Internet and looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators reported that they were searching for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovered them when one of these men published a comment approving the terrorist attacks has a YouTube video website.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, he tried to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistani native tribe zone, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer, who reported the case, stated on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were set off for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the formidable mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike squad.
The reason they were dropped out was mentioned by an official who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is trustworthy.
Since the 11 September 2001 attacks, the US Intelligence Service has given top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
Organization recruiters function as watchmen, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits were subject to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts reported.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years in allowing them to join because American news agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding a climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protestors marched the streets this Saturday and demanded more intense climate action from negotiators at Bella City Congress Centre.
The protestors reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists laid a few small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the small incident in the United Nations climate talks, thousands of activists went through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-class) and one in Spanish, which said "Country says 'sufficient'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that she had travelled to her mother's birth in Peru and provided me with information about the state of the country in which climate change is still affecting.
This is a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to pass through the world and appeal to the leaders of the world to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done; it cannot be avoided at all times.
The police prevented protesters from approaching the centre of Bella and said that she had detained 19 people, primarily because they either had masks on or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participated viewers who does not wish to be identified, because they are involved in the climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black clothes placed several charges near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, they started with lights, but then there were "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the minds of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is what I was not aware of" (it is indeed something I do not realize).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He observed whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of everyone.
It is visible the focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The test date revealed persistent persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of mathematical knowledge was a welcome feature of the good news regarding public education in Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade students in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Testimony Centre for Teaching Progress are the persistent differences in knowledge between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of the white pupils of the fourth grade district of Columbia in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not sufficiently high.
The image over a six-year period is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black fourth grade pupils in 2003 when the first NAEP was conducted in the county was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the results were improved in children from both groups during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
Some district education attorneys said in the last week that the results celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the sum of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of the D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates equality in the district.
I don't jump up and down for a two or three-point distraction, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) committee, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown said that the report on the test results means secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the logs, and I respect that.
But what's terrible is that we haven't devoted almost any time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the district is to continue looking for better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new basics of reading, Wilson’s reading system, focused on high school students and high school students who have not managed to master the basics of reading before in their knee careers are significantly behind their peers.
Every day mathematics and basics of mathematics teaching into the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that got into the district as former director of Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the NAEP progress that was reported last week.
And I think we should continue our work and do the best we can for those students who remain below the level of the class, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others stated that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain winning dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Convention’s correction procedure is to focus on the means and administrative reforms of schools located in the worst parts of the district of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can be on political sounds aimed at an important agenda.
But the uplift also belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the average between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen the relationship between our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be confident that their children will receive excellent public education.
Mr Janey, director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the main element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to achieve the right of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who entered into a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers to be a "sign" to look for a greater increase next year.
Making Higher Education a Part of a Better Future
The bus entered Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracie's parents barely graduated from El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the field of college.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were studying Gettysburg, where schooling was $38690 a year, their position was more than terrified visitors excited about potential students.
That's it! she called Graciela, who would love to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the science building.
Wow, really? rules thoughtfully when they told them a low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited their class trip and were now fully interested in the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a serious problem with the high number of children born to Spanish immigrants who are expelled from colleges or who are pregnant as minors in the United States, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish students from the college - remarkable results are said that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success story is important, according to researchers, because it highlights their point of entry forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the labour force of the country.
Those who achieved higher education say that they had a natural attachment to school and an inborn permeability and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to attend the course - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we take into account that children come from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them norient themselves in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve this, says Patricia Gandaro, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a preschool network in all ways to get them to go to college.
The federal program, which financed Graciely's tour of the tracks, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (adapted), it provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems for the launch of new preparatory programmes, which start for students from small income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have joined colleges, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get significant oil companies to rebuild their infirm infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone with capital participation to just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies were paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost bid.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was irritated in June.
The full participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here first on the road Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It'll be a long time before something else is in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US Army, are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proved to be the third largest commodity reserve, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were at a disadvantage, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that entered into agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contact with the Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The State of China's National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economicist, as well as a technological force, said the spokesman for the oil industry ministry Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to competition and will be worthy of its obligations towards Iraq.
The companies which were provisionally selected to submit tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry at the price of a barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current levels in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
During the impact of the American rocket at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, a top-notch al-Qaeda operation planner was apparently killed this week, as US counter-terrorism officials announced on Friday.
It has been confirmed that this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Sáh in the province of Northern Vaziristan on Thursday, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
The local authorities found that the missiles had been launched from a non-mannered aircraft operated by the CIA in an area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were listed on a white car heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, along with the Pakistani C.I.A., who telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local armed men had leaned to the point and quickly entertained what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two US anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying that Somalia was post-death.
Somalia was listed as a highly-built al-Qaeda military operation planner who operated terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the founding of the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who cited the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaeda's top management and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia quickly progressed in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well - known person for some Americans, but he did not in any way humiliate himself to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Namudin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribe zone and three other top-notch post-op leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two, according to Long War records, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people suspected of being informants, listed the site.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations High Delegation in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March and end the turbulent term of office that had been charged with widespread corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure is taking place because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation said it supported growth, but expressed concern that the US timetable to reduce the situation that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their strength.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping to transform Afghanistan politically.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not giving up, but he was simply fulfilling the promise he had made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look after the follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun to seek compensation.
Officials stated that he was deciding between Staffan di Misturo, who was of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led the UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the Earth presidential election for masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide denied these allegations, but said the Galgraith indictment -- which was released -- "has definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism in view of the international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens to coordinate efforts to lead the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also immersed in the leadership of the United Nations to enable his successor to hire more United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN's heavy-duty recruitment regulations undermine her ability to exploit her abilities.
The UN rules were such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon be imposed on Iran "further significant sanctions" for lack of involvement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey to areas where he was fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, was piling up prospects for armed action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is an insurmountable uncertainty in the war.
Obama's administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also reach ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and bans" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will suffer extremely" sanctions.
According to the Friday opinion issued by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved the European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not fully align its nuclear programme with the United Nations Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In his October 1st talks in Geneva, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for the essential fuel needed for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administration has set itself up for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the Interim Agreements - partly because the Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, when it comes to Iranian hardness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that it has really agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a final deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which Hillary Rodham Clinton, foreign minister, once called "degrading sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned Thursday what it called "unreasonable and unfounded accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue its discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before departing to the Kurdistan area, rich in oil, to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
The high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi majority persists, especially due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent US plans from delaying the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to suppress Kurdish concern over the ongoing depression. US official places quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaan, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Wejia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "The Mother Earth is too exhausted to consume more children" and "An extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and ageing populations in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We kept nothing for others, says Wang, 31, the human resources manager who has an eight-month-old son.
For more than 30 years China's ongoing policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations only of notoriously chubby and bent children, effectively called "small emperors", endangering the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy has collapsed, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population is 60 years old and over, is predicted to increase violently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater than the rich coastal cities with a population of higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 years of age and older made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of labour forces in the future".
He says it's "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual calming
As was introduced into the country’s constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate established by the Communist Party to date.
The two who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official seats have promoted a policy that has helped the country to prevent the critical extraction of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to submit to abortions in the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, civil servants have gradually been milder in their opinion of a child’s policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed the exception -- including the inhabitants of cities, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were individuals -- and in 2007 they eased the dichotomy of their hardline passwords.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Population Research Institute, said that central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes than allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters, encouraging parents to have only one child replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be appropriate to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and move leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Grief-warming response
Although officials in a rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign has started, most urban districts have not reported changes.
Huinan, a city district with a population of 115000, for example, still registers four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caola, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people didn't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that she would like two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a substantial capture network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view one child’s policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in union with the first child during the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem isn't just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the administrator of human resources, says they only want one child, because she was also an only child: "We were the center of the attention of our families and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care, and in fact we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is taking over the translation company, expressed this much more inconceivably.
For middle - class two - career parents who had reduced their birth rate, he said being successful meant being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds view parents as the breaking days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of nutrition for themselves, he says.
It's just one kid who puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still questionable questions of the propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You have to have resumes ready at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterised by far-reaching unpunished attitudes and mutualization -- again on Friday aimed at releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations that bear most of the burden at the earliest date.
The text, which can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as highlights the way forward.
But there was important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the United Nations ad hoc working group, this text makes no clear how much money rich countries should provide for those poor to deal with global warming in the short term and in the long run.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the top limit on global temperature growth, which political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This supplies the process with a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the chief representative of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, an outline of 180 pages of the text from the negotiations to focus on what a top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations can jointly reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent year-on-year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
On Friday, the European Union discussed a rapid promise to provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to deforestation prevention.
On Friday, however, he referred to the same type of verbal fireworks that prevailed during interviews last week.
US Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected a speech requiring mandatory greenhouse gas emission restrictions for industrial countries compared to volunteering for major developing economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The movement signaled that Obama's administration had established a tougher line against China without Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without transferring the main developing countries and carrying out actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief negotiator on climate issues that either the lack of "salary reason" or "extraordinary irresponsibleness" had led earlier in the week to the announcement that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, pulls broke both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current fight is mainly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States, regarding the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while the poorer nations point out that the two dozen most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperative for carrying out more important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large issuers responsible for their actions.
It is a clear game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants, said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "caused a political push on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economies such as China and India.
The meeting called for a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the Heads of Government competed for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and held the halls of the centre of Bella at closed meetings and new conferences, so they could specify the requirements to be assessed next week.
The full scope of the meeting - when 13,000 people were moved from and to the convention centre every day, the guitars played by activists staged in the night ironically looked at about the countries they thought they had sent them, and there was hand-in-hand handovers on paper rather than by e-mail - under the control of a call.
The intensity is only an upgrade: almost all key ministers and formerly 60 heads of state were present in Copenhagen.
We got to the top categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first train at 140 miles an hour has redefined this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 p.m. on Monday morning the whistle cut through the darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford to Kent to London's St. Pancras and exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal suite outside of LLndyn.
He hopes that the new service will, if necessary, connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Abandoned standing waters should reduce transport times in personal transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties were allowed to acquire themselves for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and the fear of environmental disruption have now halted the construction of British high-speed routes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide a viable study to the government, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another planned high-speed network stage.
London's new route to Western Midland was designed up to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open country, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also envisages determining three choices for a large high speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is the confirmation of the shape of the letter Y when one high-speed line should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has taken place," said the railway expert.
Once it's done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already proposed in such a way as to take trains of 400 m long that would be able to transport 1,100 people.
Up to 18 kits could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to service up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to capture the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks or does not intend to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be reached before the general elections.
Even if it moves the wheels, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on the Tory Orange.
Alan Duncan, the Tory's front seat holder in the House of Representatives paid thousands of pounds of expenses last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
the spokesman for the prison which was demolished by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "out of allocations", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a durum-covered expansion in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, in total hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
Last night, Mr. Duncan expressed his demands that "it should be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses at all in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a glass for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last audit by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a mortgage of 271406 pounds from his property in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Representatives.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March of last year.
In April his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest on Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, indicating that all of this was intended to finance a 75,000-pound loan.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment decreased in December 2007 from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March of this year, with which it remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued his claim of £1250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret rapporteur filmed it and said that Members must survive "to be assigned" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on an assignment and treat you like a fuck-up."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my right and a small fraction on what was necessary.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I won't."
An MP, a millionaire from his former career as a oil dealer, was first called on to explain his editions in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before the approval of the financial office that it "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound pit in the shape of Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was discovered that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked about the increase in the mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved both by the financial authority and then by Legg."
He added: "It is not a question of hiding and calling or breaking rules or anything else.
It's an absolute equal line down, according to the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be much easier or simpler in many other ways."
Come and take a look at the cottage on Brighton's coast with an adventurous calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the spring months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates the spiritual enjoyment of creativity called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to view the last cottage from 17.30 to 6.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and boiled wine provided free of charge.
Selected Christmases included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant at television marketing from Howe, is a priest with no scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, should we expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a awakening way.
"The idea of the adventure calendar in the cottages was just created as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it spiritually."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and 100,000 according to the organizers have demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the time of the UN climate conference, which aims to reach an agreement on Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, announced that the growing worldwide mobilization, which is clear evidence of the current event, would have contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of any failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 black - dressed demonstrators began to break the exhibitions with tiles and hammers.
The orderly police immediately intervened.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and in the seat "retained in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards Bella Center, where the talks were held.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting took place at candlesticks with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities and besides Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue robes, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say that anymore: it's time for that, declared by the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water streams are drying up, and today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures of the struggle for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first event began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people entered the streets.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothes, and with scarves of evolutionary importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters came out to the streets demanding a strong action against climate change.
Hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the 350 movement in France, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "fraggot"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow has declared this pro-Russian separatist territory independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step a "fracture".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on the control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% before the closing of the electoral rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned these elections.
These elections are frackish.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "sorrys that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of the territory was recognised by the 216,000 inhabitants of Nicaragua and Venezuela alone, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said AFP Quarchia Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to the election room in the school in the capital of Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian sovereignty is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be proud of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants there are huge billboards with Bagapš next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful elections were welcomed by the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhaz, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations Organization, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbo and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutba, criticised the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhaz railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
In order to win the election, it takes an over-half majority of 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive match shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: world events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to the organizers manifested in the cold weather afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries operating on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards Bella Center, where the talks were held.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting took place at candlesticks with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP, incidents occurred shortly after the parade, when a group of hundreds of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed cells and hammers, began to break up the exhibitions.
The orderly police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifestos knocked them down.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer was injured with a plaque cube on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near the squat near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people according to police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters again flew into the air.
Most of the protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue robes, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a balance of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures of the struggle for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has called several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first event began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people entered the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and scarfs with the evolutionary importance of solar energy, manifested themselves in front of the council of the capital of the Philippines.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta with a demand for a strong action against climate change.
Hundreds of people participated in protests organized by the 350 movement in France, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

Courses of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general high school, Chatel said.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that history and geography subjects will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of the general high school, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of high school.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for all there will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because according to him specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences, but "in fact, the best students are in it".
The EC and L specialisations cannot be for any sub-specialisations, it continues and stresses: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have difficulty learning geography and history in the last year of the vocational schools".
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by the Journal of Humanities, showed that seven out of ten (69%) French people disagreed with the government's project to abolish the compulsory teaching of history and geography in the senior year with specialization of S, and that is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation, both left and right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it is not considered" to cancel philosophy in the specialization programme of the senior year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which according to them sacrificed pedagogical education to future teachers of high school.
In the course of Master's degree 2 (M2), he will begin the year's acceptance test aimed at their field and at the end of the year a further test verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of Master's degree and will perform in front of students as an intern professor.
If you count all the internships offered before the admission procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project for the cancellation of the school map by 2012.
At the École elite university, normal supreiures have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced in Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the International Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole Normale superieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, which is a one-day seminar composed of 15-minute contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained at the conference of 22 years of age, Eduard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local lake, which the students so named.
About 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared comments, only with the help of graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference relies on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the website of schools since 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and others will follow with a regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
Prison supervisors' committees announced "general mobilisation" on Friday, demanding that premiums and overtime be paid for Christmas holidays for financial reasons, which were postponed for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Board of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have a service to attend demonstrations held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities and to "block" them and thus point out "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd branches of this sector) called on them "to convene meetings in individual prisons and start essential mobilization" by "stupid and unacceptable" so that "overtimes and extra charges at night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October will not be paid in December.
The First Board of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the overall mobilization...) in order to show dissatisfaction and resentment".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and not all have been included in the financial budget, but ensure that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
The office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent messages to the unions of prison officers, which assured them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the Minister writes in her communication.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has arisen from the poor assessment of overtime, has never again been repeated in the future, has been added to Minister Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the famous premium for performing their functions and fulfilling their objectives, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille became bitter and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and calls".
Employees will not come to work on Sundays or holidays if the extras for these days of October are not paid in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they give us more work and more tasks without giving us more staff, it is sad to let those lowest positions of staff pay for it, CGT prison guards in Bordeaux say.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case the funds, because few, were noted by Secretary-General Upap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he's giving "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he gets
American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided in Oprah Winfrey's "godina" screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC Station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and at the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will get his nickname.
Jesus likes Boa, too, said Michelle Obama with the fact that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, as is the result of the excerpts from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also turned against her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts that he received: "Well, no, I gave you great gifts last year," she teased the president.
Well, that's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but right after that, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace, "Who gave you this?"
During this one - day, very relaxed show with a famous moderator who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also spoke about their unpopular gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama presented a bicycle with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father devoted to him at Christmas, with which he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
After a long time, I realized that the ball was actually given to me by him.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but that little doll house I loved, I reminded Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-opered, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep.
Johnny Hallyday was re-opered in Los Angeles because of the "injury" caused by the larger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL said that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66th-year-old rocker was re-opered from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors observed "the injuries resulting from the operation" of the heated fence he had performed in Paris on November 26th, his press department reported in Paris that these lesions required a "reparation operation".
However, the press department of the singer tried to calm the public down and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial sleep to prevent "pains and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little more certainty, he adds RTL.
The press department, on request, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of a ferocious fence.
The surgery, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Deljoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information of RTL.
After this operation, Johnny Hallyday's singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the attack.
A singer named Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend was just going through a "bad time", but he added that he "didn't care" about the rocker, because he's a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a stupid thing because spending 12 hours on a plane after a surgery like this is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night he calmed down the situation of the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small small small intestine tumor" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his bachelor party.
But since then, every health problem has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the report of a new hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the big pool, won the 2009 European Championships in Istanbul in a discipline he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, which last allowed combinations, only three world records fell, though many more were expected.
One of them defeated the Hungarian race Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m location race and two remaining men's relay Russia at 4x50 m location race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made a catch on the world record in a 50m free way, which is already the holder of the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where ten swimmers started in the premiere instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Dragag (20,70) and Russia's Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but failed to beat the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore a combination made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combineds helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination did not help this time the Germans Paul Biederman, a double world champion in a large pool in the summer of Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record, which holds 400 metres free (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I couldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title, and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: The board of the Romani sarcophagus belonging to Zola was auctioned off for $1.5 million
The board of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than French writer Emil Zola, was auctioned out on Thursday for $1.5 million, much more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby’s.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63-cm high front panel, from the third century of our year, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysus scenes in the elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded satyrs and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces in the world is very few, about four or five," AFP reported on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still underway, but this is the object on which it hit most, according to AFP spokesman Sotheby’s Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated the bath with her in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly the President of the Council before the arrival of Marshal Petain.
She's been shaded in there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found out when searching the museum database in Louvre that this was part of the "remnants of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rugon-Macquart".
The interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, it is clear that there is no way to carry out this transport, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government aircraft, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya again, reported a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The desert government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demission" and to ask for political asylum abroad would only allow him to leave safely.
But the overthrown president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The government of the deserts "was further unsuccessful when it wanted me to give up my post (...), wanted me to hand over the demission," Zelaya radio Globe said on Thursday, often expressing itself to the political crisis that has lasted for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've got a downed president who's been hiding at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, Minister of the Interior of the Purgatory Government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday to Hrn Honduran Radio.
I will not ask for asylum of any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for the Telesur station, which has its headquarters in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
News of Zelaya's departure was mobilized on Wednesday by a renegade president who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the attitude of the Purgatory government.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who came closer to the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28th, the day he organized the preparations for his re-election of the public consultation against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held responsible for the crime of treason, which he's accused of, the desert government claims.
On November 29th, President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. business balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the US trade balance show a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on the American balance sheet numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade balance deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, in particular exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the major business partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
In the United States, however, unemployment rose against all expectations last week and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job candidates has decreased "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcoiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also declined.
The yield of state treasures with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime wrote "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime wrote on Thursday to the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further demonstrations that arrested dozens of dissidents.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were published on the street by Raul Castro's supporters on their march towards the centre of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Away with the Yankees!, "The Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", " Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the raised fist supporters of the regime to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by members of the civilian population who came "to ensure security".
The day before that, there was a similar manifestation in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, some ten dissidents were detained in civilian police, who were also about to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, the AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who were drafted by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The holders of the European Parliament's 2005 price, "Ladies in White", organised an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to the dissent, of about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, spends 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "soldiers" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television has brought a report on the Thursday manifesto of supporters of the government regime against the "opposers of the revolution".
Cuba is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organisations of disrespect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, with the Communist Party at the head and policy of the government of one party.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenn.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garene (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak of Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an eighty-year-old man in or before the pharmacy, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, is a version of the police and witnesses.
A badly injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Union in the hospital as a result of injuries.
In or before this pharmacy, the attacker attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband about 30 years of age began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two others, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other one seriously.
As it all happened, it was not clear, for everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried with a cross behind his back, said on the spot the head of the Alliance's union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm, according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw about a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one of the city’s police officers who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man and were injured with fists, the police source said.
There was an incident in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenna, where there are many shops.
The neighbors came to tell me that there's an injured person out there.
I went out and I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a large abdominal wound, told AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second about 30 - year - old also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have any I.D. was arrested by the state police.
The State representative in Nanterre referred the matter to the Regional Police Investigation Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect was taken to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
A police source didn't rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy where he was transported.
He was "completely beyond himself" as "all madmen of this type whose strength in action is increasing tenfold."
USA: Polansky's lawyer again asks for an end to prosecution
Polish-French director Romana Polanski again requested Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of Pianist film, criticised three judges of the second district court of appeal in California for serious errors that occurred during the court hearing at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, counsel Hummel said, adding that from the conduct of the judge who then ruled the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a chill in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died) had allegedly dealt with the Attorney General before the verdict was handed down, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the state's own attorney, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced by the end of September that he was "lying" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel will require the execution of a court ruling in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had already been said in the first state, since there will be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought to justice.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never again entered the territory of the United States.
The prosecutor's attorney in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to participate in the trial."
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
It is the view that the director "asks a favor from the court and at the same time despises its authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take a decision also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to stop Romana Polanski's prosecution.
Victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, has also again asked for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer tolerate this eternal harassment every time the Polanski case arose and added, "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on orders from the United States
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a home prison in his cabin in Gstaad, where he is waiting for a possible discharge.
Wall Street ends in no direction, it's blocked by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market bounces among the indicators that are better than expected and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blinksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has decreased considerably, and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators which are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood on the market with regard to the stability of economic recovery", said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, a second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the confidence of American consumers also returned and in December increased to 73.4 to 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar price against the euro, which has been highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks lose land under their feet.
The market with the securities has fallen.
The revenue of the State Treasury with a view to 10 years increased to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday evening and increased from 4,492% on Wednesday evening to 4,492% on the previous day with a view to 30 years.
Miss World's election back in South Africa.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to go beyond their goal of achieving their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty took place in Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being, five candidates have reached the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were selected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real faith of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so much experience!, Miss Sierra Leone confided.
The competition, which takes place in the South African Republic after the ninth, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, in northern Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I'd put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy I could have had it twice, confided in Miss Ksenia Sukhin in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "breathing landscape".
After months of performances, tests, meetings with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the winners of 1994, who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We're emissaries of our countries, and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and Chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown that it can welcome a world of heat that is difficult to cope with, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, candidates participated in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the president unusual, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I didn't even dream of.
I'm sure I'll go back to World Cup 2010, says with enthusiasm Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of the state of Hallyday are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong and everything's going very well, said David Hallyday when he got off the plane, which came from Paris shortly after 13 p.m. local time (21 p.m. world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, declared that "as soon as possible" would arrive at the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection caused by an operation of a heated intervertebral fence which he entered on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press release, the night in Los Angeles was performed because of the comfort of "put into artificial sleep", which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a hospital doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already in artificial sleep. Hospitalization was caused by an infection following an operation of a heated intervertebral fence carried out on November 26th in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at night.
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a French Lycea school performance Friday morning in Los Angeles, attended by their daughter Jade.
The advantage of the orthopaedic surgery and traumatology department of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catone, announced that he was flying to the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Deljoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du parkc Monceau in Paris on November 26th.
They told us it was a massacre.
L.A. surgeons said they were incapacitated, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which greatly surprised me, since I had already suffered twice by the failure of the intervertebral fence, he added.
Earlier on the RTL radio station, the singer apparently flew after a Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Deljoux is very famous in art circles.
He operated on Maria Trintignant's actress in Vilnius a few days before she died at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine that he was acting on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematoma resulting from brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, condemned several times in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a medical examiner, described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" called before the medical chamber, and whom can not even "recommend".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke to the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure was "very good progress" and the post-op examination was "normal."
The operation was not of a haemorrhagic nature and therefore it was not necessary to introduce the drain," he added.
The singer's health problems have been on the rise since this year, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with the questioner.
It is clear that the date of the renewal of the planned tour on 8 January (In Amiens, note the order) appears to be too close, Camus declared.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre side not to continue to use their acronyms.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Herv Morin, to seize the former Giscard's party for a short time by not using the abbreviation in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own the UDF shorthand by not having François Bayra to bear her inheritance after giving his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step received support from the Member of Hervé de Charetta (former pro-UMP now for NC), who attributed ownership of the UDF brand because he first registered it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004 (l'Institut national de la propréité industriale).
But on Friday night, the UDF committee, managed by Françoise Bayrou's friends, who did not intend to be allowed to take over, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to the minister and the MPs to stop using the shortcut and return the property of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised a disturbing statement that you will propose to your political movement + to take over the UDF + shortcut, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance of Centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional material and on the welcoming website of your movement the name+Nouveau Centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to immediately remove all UDF references from all promotional materials including (its) websites.
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of the trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will refer to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter they state that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" departure in 2007 to create a competitive movement, as others in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre movement therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee tasked with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years now", but an UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used non-existent acronym registrations to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then with irony they express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to emerge from anonymity by accepting names that we do not have a right to."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the condition of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to rule on whether he used the condition of the eighty-year-old billionaire to lose her share of her assets, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him for.
A photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the condition of weakness, which is a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years is imposed and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This Decision confirms that there will indeed be a process in the case that can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter are attacked and are fighting for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination by 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be conducted by a college of three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State Agency in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time state whether Lilliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he's gonna step on it.
I'll talk to her about it, he announced after the lawyer's hearing, Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
As for Attorney Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent message(...). The expert will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he has manipulated (M. Banier).
It's been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter started a criminal trial against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who is accused of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to gain the gift of a billion euros in checks, life insurance contracts or master's paintings.
So Lillian Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's trial of lawyers had changed in the family's hour of truth.
Lilliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary expressing her distrust of her husband, Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years once or twice a day.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State Agency in Nanterre again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, even more so that the guardian judge rejected her application for legal protection for her mother these days.
Lillian Bettencourt "is fully able to take part in the court, is not protected or in custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be heard at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, it has been a reminder of the behaviour of large company management vis-à-vis employees of companies vis-à-vis consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a matter of ensuring that co-workers identify themselves with "values" from the mountain, as they used to be when consumers had to force products that came out of the ideas of the heads of factories.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution of the market acquisition strategy was compared in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to force products other than customer preferences are regularly returned!
Passive treatment of employees can lead to lethal demoralisation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much broader general phenomenon, which mainly affects management cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires from all the parties involved ...) an active approach and the ability to predict" and requires employees to undertake obligations which are totally contrary to the incomes of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a management revolution, which should aim to put workers at the centre of the company's interest as well as a client.
Relative usefulness of internal surveys of public opinion.
Internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done after various detours!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionately with the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Since they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their thought comfort, they adopt an old behavioral theory, currently revived by "neurosciences" from the US and widely disseminated without greater knowledge of the scientific constitution and the media.
With the ability to move through the levers (sic) of the involvement of managers, the recent survey by Ipsos on Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises foresees the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating the basic attention into all the intentions and practices of the procedure : It will only be possible for employees to commit to the company if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation only concerns studies Motivative functional analysis.
These studies have shown that it evaluates its companies on the basis of a predetermined doxy that will enable them to assess, through the image it speaks of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilisation, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and state their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of a solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "fair war" Obama earned praise from the right hand.
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech Barack Obama gave the day before that in Oslo, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who at first mocked Obama's award on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice president's candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the muse of the right-wing republican wing, for the U.S. daily Today, and added that she herself expressed herself in her memories on this topic of "sometimes necessary" war.
War, of course, is the last thing the Americans want to do at work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the sending of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used his speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama's, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech quite historical, Gingrich declared during the interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see the "left president" reminding members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush's speeches, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented "a very American speech".
He not only referred to himself as "the world citizen" as always, but "he spoke as the American president" and reminded the Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to keep it," Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissatisfactions are the hawks of the Bush era, former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who described the speech as "single, puffy and uninspired", as he stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the President, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is terrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"When we wrap war in a box of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the mid-left press has a laudable opinion on the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the peace price to Obama premature, he considered his performance to be "excessive" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international solutions to conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," says the California daily.
Obama "expounded what was necessary", evaluated the New York Times, and marked the speech "as simple and instructive".
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathon proceedings, road transport unions and TLF, the only employer organisation that remained until the end of Friday evening, reached an agreement that ended the call for a strike and a threat that was hanging over the supply of Christmas supplies.
State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, negotiators broke up early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even so, three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting to start at 11 o'clock to get everyone to agree and at 18 o'clock to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "would threaten to see holidays disrupted at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase of 4% in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It is not much, but there is much effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we give our members an order not to block out any supply centres.
But there may be several more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "right agreement", although it was difficult to admit to the increase in high wages due to international competition."
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a matter of agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a revalue of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th wage and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in wages tax" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 draft budget law, which he voted on Thursday night at the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "conform" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later to the whole field, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
There will be "at the shortest possible date", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only slow down disagreements between employers' organisations.
FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "has already been offered to the sector in the context of compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but to avoid anger at turkey eaters during the coming Christmas season, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement in the next 12 months "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
RER A suburban trains: weekend traffic interruptions, trade unions not satisfied with the RATP transport company's proposals.
The suspension of traffic on the line of RER A suburban trains, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the management of the RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the premium issue.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will only ride between 10 and 20, at the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will ride every other train, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette's shopping houses, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to secure contact with large commercial houses".
RER A leads from the west to the east of Paris' agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
One train out of two was in operation on Friday, and virtually no set was driving at a time outside the peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France did otherwise and there was no confusion at the platform.
So early in the morning it was at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) much less people than usual, including because there were no pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen an hour and a half earlier to make sure he was on time.
Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, it announced the SNCF State Railway, as more administrators and law enforcement officers were predicted.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare train station with a subway connection.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the management will be evaluated as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER and suburban trains on all sides, working time adjustments, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (South Committees).
RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which made it worse for CGT with the fact that the management "has not been able to solve the problem while the travel carriers and SNCF have done so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "they are closer to reviewing the conditions of performance", RATP said.
Which is why the union thinks the company "makes fun of weekend travelers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by the business committee in its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interests of "calming down".
The danger is that Tuesday's conflict will also spread on the RER B line after Unsa and the Independent announce the strike emergency.
The committees request a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and are making it difficult for the worsening working conditions on this line, which transports a million passengers daily.
RER commuters earn between 2200 and 2700 euros in gross wages and 600 to 650 euros in irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision brings with it severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered a protest in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," Hasim Killic, President of the Supreme Court, told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously taken by 11 judges when a majority-seven vote was required to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and Ambassador Aysela Tugluk, were prohibited from taking part in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced that the parliamentary immunity exercised by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance had been lifted.
The DTP Party has 21 seats (of 500) in Parliament.
The party's leadership has already warned before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political responsibility.
The decision is the continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is a legal political display of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds towards the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a renewed tension in the southeast of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been thrown against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained into confrontation with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, predominantly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protesters threw Molotov's cocktails again, or fired stones from washing machines.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was handed down, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice would only "encourage despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurds, note the order) by banning the party, said in the press.
The Government, which is a party to the Islamic movement, has also condemned this decision.
We're on the anti-interruption principle.
There's nothing to solve, Secretary of Energy Tanner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete rejection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commentator Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Winter Office.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall proceed in accordance with the exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called sections and the bigwig, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and pass-through moves such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of suburban public transport, pedestrian zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
FES starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, wet salt should be poured for a maximum of three hours, which is better held, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "that the roads be free when the right to work starts."
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make a place for the weeds."
Only when so snowy are incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pedestrians will be on their way, and dangerous places and crossings will be cleaned up.
FES can mostly not take care of all cycle trails.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 mostly bridges, says Brauburger.
As they are rapidly formed by a glacier, they leave the bulkheads as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call them.
Dinosaur cradle
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: An animal two meters long and a half tall ran along two strong hind limbs, had a long skull with sharp, twisted teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in a Thursday edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characters.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the supercontinent of Panda.
Tawa opens a new window for the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about related relationships, enlargements and early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is not seen for Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were identified by scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected remains from a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are very rare, most of which are found only individual fractions."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially remarkable is this finding not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the allocation of pradinosaurs is generally controversial.
Experts are discussing, for example, when lizards were divided into three of the most important development lines: carnivorous teropods, which later included Tyranzaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as birds, "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and ornithischia (birds), which included, for example, Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after analysis Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, evidence of airbags, which even the descendants of the therapists have birds.
Airbags make the breathing of birds more effective than mammals.
The bones of the spine were obviously filled with air in the Tawa hallae.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terror with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, it created this useful innovation probably a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs have ever lived in South America, scientists have come to know that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three development lines were divided soon and spread from South America to all the continents that formed a single Earth mass as the supercontinent of Panda.
The fact that the team found the remains of two others with Tawa hallae, not particularly closely related theorists, would also suggest that.
These three can't come from one common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also differences.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His suggestion could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while in other continents they rarely find themselves.
As the dinosaurs have shown, from a relatively rare sideline of reptiles, it remains a mystery to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Middle Ages.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many more reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
About the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while relatives also died out of the trias and juries.
The History of Success Did Not Last Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extermination, which the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever anyway.
150 million years later, the impact of meteorite on another group of animals, which has also evolved in the triassic and has lived since then in the shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Assistants from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Brem joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casinos of the University of Frankfurt took care of the world’s uproar.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth University, but also universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidaritying with protesting students at Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "do not approve" of the exhilarating police intervention.
Since the walls and works of art were mutilated, University President Werner Müller-Estler cleared the building that was occupied last week by the students and lecturers on strike.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, according to the signallers, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the self-organised teaching of students and teachers of police command".
Clearing is an "unacceptable intervention" in freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "unjustification and criminalisation of the protest" and diverts attention from content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
Most strikers are said not to have supported material damage.
A legitimate protest
The youth union organisation Verdi and the German trade union also solidarity students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the proceedings of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, said Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Earth House on Thursday.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said a member of the Earth House at the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Links saw it.
CDU takes painted walls for an excuse to criminalise a protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there has been a clearing.
Linke made a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it has paid for a secret city that is not accessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded location where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this area is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Green City representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "The Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's deputy minister Jurij Rosljak and the Prefect from Zelenograd Anatolij Smirnov, signed by Edwin Schwarz, head of planning.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ will be allowed to entrap itself on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the home of important Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossiskaj Elektronika.
The period was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of "Green City") has acquired its name according to forested hilly landscapes in which research facilities are installed.
Stuttgart brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared at all.
For the project promoter, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than launching a station, more than a monster building that will throw the capital of Badenska-Württemberg for a decade into a desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the center of the city were then considered to be 19th century transport-technical fossils, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormous time to prevent locomotives from the back.
Drive, pull over for a while, move on, that's how it's supposed to work.
And that's why the head station is disappearing in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about half the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have come to realize that in the Hesen and Bavarian cities, the start of the building is almost unreliable.
Since there are modern winding trains with motor vehicles and driving vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have problems with driving and taking off.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
They pushed the land and the municipal politicians.
The routes cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer and not by the state firm.
The urbanist project can be excused in any other way.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For the railway transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway stations and the construction of the track are designed for personal transport, which – typically in the 1980s – attributed a tremendous increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
Modern transport policy must go first and foremost to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep rises.
More importantly, S21 directly touches a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros was to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be no funding for other nodes and narrow grid sites.
There are 60 major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometres of long route along the Valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987 it has been slowing down on this route.
There'd have to be a lot of pressure around here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The track through the valleys of the Rhine will become the throat of the international freight bottle: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government is examining the airport judgment
The Earth government left open the Wiesbaden Earth House if it would oppose the judgment of the Hesen Administrative Court (VGH) concerning the ban on night flights and allow it to be audited.
The CDU/FDP Coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today in writing argued that in the event of the construction of the planned northwestern runway of the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to re-edit the nocturnal nocturnal ban.
The 17-year permit between the 23rd and 5th hours, as expected by the Earth government, does not comply with the law ordered to protect the population from night noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January if it will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and came to the representative of the government to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to promises regarding the ban on night flights that she had made before the election. Otherwise it is possible to evaluate it as a "infringement of the word".
It is damn hard, if you can keep your word, said the head of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in a hint of the FDP electoral slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Sach refused the exception of Schäfer-Gümbel, the earthly government is trying to get on its night flights by "misleading the law and tricks".
Accurate legal checks need their time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction against the no-night flights were never the same as that of the opposition.
American banks are paying off aid
America's, the crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
On Wednesday, Bank of America paid off aid from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund totalling $45 billion (about €30 billion).
According to an American CNBC station report, Citigroup also plans to pay state aid.
The constitutions thus want to remove the restrictions on the acceptance of money - the limitation of the remuneration of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has provided a good 19 billion dollars of net money to investors thanks to convertible bonds.
The remaining amount was taken from its treasury, which was filled, inter alia, by professional sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night specifically thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection helped us overcome the difficult time.
The money institute damaged itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
The Citigroup also wants to get rid of its commitments to the state by providing money on the capital market.
With a reference to sources, CNBC reported that the US bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
The talking Citigroup didn't want to say anything about it.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley paid for their help.
Quick Selection
It was only going faster than expected.
The station presented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors expelled Mr Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, we wanted to make a deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital of Berlin, was named the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so that it doesn't run the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass through the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the play.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, he failed the Schächter Board of Management with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
For Brender, only seven members voted against him, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it could be expected.
The EU majority of the board of directors signalled a few weeks before the elections that they did not wish to confirm Brender in the office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organised by Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue his stay in the office of a highly-respected editor by arguing that the quotas for Brender for monitoring the ZDF's reporting were reduced.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests in which the political impact on the ZDF was strongly criticised.
Finally, the debate included even 35 state-owned lawyers, who regard Koch’s procedure as a non-constitutional one.
It wasn't for nothing.
About a person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, teaching and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey went to the ZDF, first to the heute-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reference of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; up to 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the main study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the professional periodical Media Magazine journalist of the year, was sitting down, Greens announced that they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch's opponent in the board of directors, Rne-Fal Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the authorising officer could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's deposition, he was very critical of this.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could have nominated him as editor-in-chief without losing face as Schächter, and could have been elected by the board of directors without suspecting that a pager would have been pushed into office.
In page arithmetic, Frey is sort of like left-wing liberals.
The studio's getting rid of the harpsichord
Partial success for students: After the year of the strike, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal countries on Thursday: At the conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both sides agreed that it was their will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: In principle, each study module should end with one single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be reviewed and a "real and defensive rate" guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The federal states undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for bachelor and master study fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about a better study.
Now they're filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board has found that the number of tests will in part drastically decrease: "Every module will normally be terminated by one test", says the 30-page report, which is intended to regulate in part the approval of the study sectors.
"A significantly lower test load," declared the Chairman of the Accreditation Board of the Reinhold Grimm, "is to be stopped by a false development that has significantly reduced the study's complexity."
To this end, the "studies of the study" in the future "the decisive criterion" in implementation should be "the challenge of the study".
Modules and content "must be scrutinized" so "do not overly limit the students when choosing
seminars."
Students should have "a claim to space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the approval of new fields of study, after examination but also to existing fields of study.
These need to be "reduced" every five years – but this means that it will last until 2015 before all study fields are checked.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils set up by the federal countries.
In October, the ministers of culture called on the "emphasis" of the federal countries to act on the agencies so that the filling of the teaching was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures by the Earth ministries.
So far, the only country has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
From money, universities should primarily pay for consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the university law.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
Forming a study should be even more flexible, and recognition of tests from other higher schools should be guaranteed and the Master's degree should be made easier.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study areas in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition again argued Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
Juso's Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for the creation of an education policy not to take place in the future "after closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
Not later than after the strike, "at least a word" should also be spoken of by students as persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Culture Ministers, who were consulted by the HRK on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal right that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a master's degree.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that for today's generation of bachelors there are enough seats available tomorrow in the master's courses with the best study conditions, said GEW member Andreas Keller.
Federal countries must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their freedom of access to Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and getting out is a nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out language piece discusses the experience of travelling one dissident who gained freedom but lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, working first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a children's bookstore, then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he took care of a significant extra-literary disturbance at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently uncertain and infected Söllner left a statement in which, in front of his fellow writers, Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Tok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, he admitted to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received a German language prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts began inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I, continued Sollner, "then someone who didn't defend himself enough to try to intimidate the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken by a case that marks the depth and disgrace of the political system, which is based on control and focus.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the previous state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate files, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter.
"He was extorting" me back then at all the important points for him, Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and unexpected to this audience, but it is not entirely surprising that the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service were admitted.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Spics of Securities.
The matter, you can assume, will speculate and in some cases even know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the native, in the meantime a very certain examination of the Stazi components, handling the remainder of the Securitate control is still highly diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been dreamt of and limited.
One of Birthler's authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was not established until 1999, the issuance of the act took place more recently.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the components.
The former members of the Securities Office still have a strong influence in Romania, and after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, one interview was given by one of the former chiefs of Security of Temeshvar, who rejected the award holder.
She said she had psychosis, and she was interrogated only once.
The oppression of power here has been expressed completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of the Söllner case, as in the case of the silent offence, there are inescapable questions.
Why not now? Who has been harmed? The special reaction of listeners to Sollner's confession makes him expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the adjective of guilt and shame.
It's more than a footnote to Herta Müller's work, which accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It looked like a cleanly dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party where he was handing out sports goods for sweets when he was on the fourth hour after midnight to the invited Mercedes Class C new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-coloured sponsor bag.
The man with the brandant danced for him to drive around him to another town.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk luck was 55-year-old man too little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he'll continue his work.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days engaged Switzerland: "We have reached the eight-finals", namely in Champions League thanks to the victory3:1 over Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be impressed by the success: It will be a brutally hard fight against the fall."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class and in the ordinary league day in Momoc.
And to prevent the recurrence of obvious weaknesses after three quick goals of Marica (5), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Draw
The Olympics Champions League (match 16./17. + 23/24 February/ 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
Therefore, the joy of the startling arrival of Babel’s successor will be preserved.
Not only with a supposed healer who added confidence, willingness to put on and joy in the game to uncertain Stuttgart professionals during a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the healer of the soul Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, while acting as the therapist Babbel, did not prove any more effective.
He breathed a certain kind of magic, confessed Babbel's admirer Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a long break caused by injuries, became the best player on the field immediately thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the catch of the proverbial "fresh wind" and the work of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need right now."
Apparently, Babbel was missing it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports President Horst Heldt warns
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before there came an ugly awakening after defeating 0:4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedir.
And sports President Horst Heldt recalled that one goal was achieved in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not over the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a TV interview with goalie Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that other than Jens has made that answer to the hard Lehmann criticism.
He gave the board a weak lead and decided to change coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the fact that he cancelled his day off after the games marked Lehmann as a sign of missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's words "formed pure egoism", said Heldt and announced the sequence for goalkeepers.
Both 40s won't have any more joy in life.
Anyway, they're behind each other, that without the work of a team of coaches, it wouldn't be possible to play such a gameful and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share in success", they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
The Battle of the World's Heavy Weight Championships
Thrilling duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's master Vitali Klick.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitko remains the champion of the world in a heavyweight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klick, it is the third successful defence of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before, the Ukrainian was twice the world's champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be what everyone expected.
Click improved his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he was beaten twice for injury.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena he drove 2,02 meters high Klitko duel mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klick era ahead of the duel, was retreating before the world's champion, so Klitko could not strike the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In all, he did passive Johnson's job as a challenger enough and he was just trying to get into other circles.
Although the key provoked words and gestures, his blows only hit a few times the world's master.
Still, he is only the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klitschek full of 12 wheels.
The challenger took care of the riots in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klick as a "disgusting zombie" who can't do anything right.
During Friday's weight, the champion got provoked, pulled Johnson out of his nose with sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitskov's return
The key remained undefeated after the fourth fight after its return on 11 October 2008.
After almost a four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin, Nigeria, and took back his WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically I was in good shape, justified Klikko quickly returning to the ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
But British David Haye wears a WBA belt, after settling down from the throne in November of 2.13 meters of Nikolay Vulajev.
Haye denied in the summer the fight against Klitskov, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promotional company is planning a fight against Klickek in Wembley Stadium, London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Green faction, Jürgen Trittin, declared the Minister of Defence of Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kundúz affair.
SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowingly false" to the deadly bombing of two tanks in September, said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: he lied.
The killing order was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report NATO, read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just the destruction of stolen trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
During the American attack that German commander Kunduzu, Colonel Klein, demanded, there were up to 142 people killed or injured by NATO.
The Greens, SPD and Linke invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately to the Federal Parliament and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms Merkel must explain whether the strategy for targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Parliament - and if the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service approved this new strategy, they called on Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from Green Renate Künast.
The spokesman for the Ulrich Wilhelm government has definitely rejected criticism.
The Office of the Chancellor has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, there was a loud voice of doubt about the Ministry's listing of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
It has officially been said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and silenced the minister with sensitive details.
However, from around the two top officials, it was reported that the Ministry of Defence had been alerted to several reports, including a two-page document by Commander Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have requested in a letter to clarify the situation in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not received any response so far.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the issues and pointed out that this would be resolved in the Federal Parliament's Investigative Committee to be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not only are there boundaries between imagination and reality in the mentally ill or drug relationship.
As long as it's happening in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest ideas and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience waking dreams, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay mainly in today’s Western world for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of the mentally ill or drug - related.
The wine has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, will here and there make sure that the boundaries between sleep, imagination and reality come to pass.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in better cases we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shaman state of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be diverted from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters occurs - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have power over it.
The connection between fornication and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "the great likeness of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud was even a dream of "psychosis, with all senselessness, delusion, deception of reason".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and vigil-colored.
Gravity doesn't have any power over it, it's on the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him are winged bloody characters with bloody red faces, cherishing teeth.
They chase him, they kick him with heavy, fire boots, they throw him against the wall, they feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can't stand the voices he's been given and insulted.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, hooks them into a loop and hooks it up on the ceiling.
He's gonna step on one speaker, and he's gonna stick a rope around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop will allow it.
Learn by shouting congregation voices at his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective paranoid psychosis, which is also manio-depressive, taking anti-depressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic schizophrenics, most people can no longer distinguish between the inner and the outside world, they are exposed to an overwhelming state that can lead to hallucinations, large-scale, relative illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of votes - the voices that order, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The disabled is unable to distinguish important from insignificant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens up psychosis builds floods of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Clinics of General Psychiatric University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizoprenic is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizoprenics are therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Compared to reality is not usually possible in them, ghosts are terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, you'll experience a hallucination.
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "but the meaningful and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Mistaken thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience occurs within a realistic framework.
A scientist still faces a riddle about why our brain does such a mess.
Exceptional conditions can lead to short-term loss of a relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develops into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the disabled have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development there will be damage to neuronal brain maturation, such as maternal viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a puzzle as to how the neural system will be damaged, which has not appeared in any way in years.
Roles also play environmental impacts - stress or traumatic experiences can be an instigator of psychosis if it is at risk.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, interpreting his results last year in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations include typical side effects of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are common.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person is hallucinating under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too little suppressed; if our brain boils, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also removal of stimuli, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, she reported up to a third of those questioned that they had been hallucinated for at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Prijedna Pomoranska and attends the school there.
She's a perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
Breaks can happen when he calls her with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the students look at her with a surprise - no one sees her and hears this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's a tight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are more callous.
Often, delusions are burdensome.
When she sits in class, she can't observe the teaching as the teacher in her eyes and ears is just representing a new student, but he explains to everyone else the hearing and visible on the table of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are more crippling.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes little and too late, he cannot often tell if he is awake or if he is already asleep, if the images he sees, the grimas, or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her hands and feet arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends anything about it. They'd think she was crazy.
The fall of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucination stopped.
Ever since Kasten's psychologist contacted the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
Overwhelming is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or they're deprived of their stimuli, they're likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to take care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she called Dad since she thought she wasn't her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is happening in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear so real."
Nightmares also evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not significantly different from the hallucination of acute psychosis.
Against schizophrenics, people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world focused too much on the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, excruciating disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers real and cannot even distinguish them from the alert.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who are fully aware of motor contamination.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and of himself, perhaps by a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces a life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of boundary state between sleep and hallucination.
Because there is no way to deal with a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses into some intolerable situation that allows people to move on to a loss of consciousness in a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herwiechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery, a heart valve with a subsequent heart transplant gave him consciousness on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless on an intensive care unit.
Claussen dived into the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man tied to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between nobles who make drugs out of blood.
He'll be taken on a motorcycle by the Greeks to his country, surfed a hospital bed in the Alps and met a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen than any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
Contrary to dreams, the memories of these mental pathways are clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections, how fragile our internal images are in a watchful state of external reality.
Any change in consciousness, summed up psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 to take over the publishing industry children
The new editor of Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time he wants Hubert Burda to hand over his business to his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding is expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have the will to enter the company, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We've been working on the details carefully.
The question whether they are also active in the company is raised only after.
And the question is, do they have the skills to do that?
It is not possible to put 7500 employees at the head of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both children and businesses.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been withdrawing from the Bureau since January and appointed his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
52 years old Kallen has been a member of the Board at Burdy since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the section Treasury added responsibility for the company's property and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation also Direct marketing, Foreigner, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of publishing.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "cross 10, 15 years", Burd said.
Holding should be 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty against extinction: "It has always been touched by companies who have been infected with the desire for capital that speculated and thought they could become great players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda claims.
I don't know as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these trades are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and this is a time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrities wear, and to adapt their festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important in highlighting the figure, which is necessary to note.
We're making a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated haircut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa Energy Company, together with the Barcelona City Council, founded 'Officer Live'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE's Office (Mobility logistics) shall establish and manage a travel plan for the deployment of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, will manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are three cities that the government has chosen within the MOVELE Plan to support the deployment of electric cars.
Endesa's energy company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's involvement in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in the European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a calm season' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "calm period".
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive sector today, we would be expected to abandon, close some of our main production companies," the Prime Minister noted.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm for this industry is foreseen in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is designed to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures on the request and mentioned plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed a 6% reduction in the average emission level for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" of the entries, namely in November by "40%".
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real lightweights for collectors and visitors.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Moss and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and repair of cars; or Cochera Klasicos, a specialised Mercedes Benz company.
Exterior proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: focusing, sports performances, testing feasibility, presentations and competitions.
Qualifying tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circle outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preservation of sports style
Mazda intends to show that gentleness to the surrounding environment has no negative impact on sports style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - baptized as well as a-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
Front seats including driver seats have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With the tool kit and console, we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in developing futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a marked red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sobriety of German products and even more specifically with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish for a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is important to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is available only with a petrol engine of two litres and 150 horsepower and a six-stage manual transmission.
This engine is a real lightweight. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 is in diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
As far as equipment is concerned, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is important to mention above all the system of track tracking (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of traction and stability, control of speed, internal mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch cast wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with an additional charge of 1,500 euros: two-xenon adaptive lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, except for other parts.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterised in particular by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not find more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for the implementation of Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft like Penelope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were brighter than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'Ladies'.
FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, serves only to view mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine recognized him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of the long-term free data service provided, but it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It's limited just like his American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People with smartphones already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to eagerly look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) so that they can check their mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, one would need a Ph.D. from physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to all Europe, which is still not affected.
There is a concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, it offers download books and further search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable for purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen in the FonPeek case, it's a possibility to buy with a permanent approach like that that Peek is already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to take office as President of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when accompanied by him at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a thin set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The material from which the clothes are made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of her entry into the function Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with printing.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium high heels, now similar model, but in gold.
He also wears different hairstyles: this time drodol, pre-dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have labour problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women undergraduate years who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Infertility and Work Career of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in opinion on the number of children whether they work or not, as well as according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part - time or have no stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to the first child, and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, have been postponing partnership and motherhood and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have an average of 3.7 years since the beginning of their partnership with the partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore have to postpone their partnership and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although it has a minor impact on the start of a partnership with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is involved in CSIC research.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and childbirth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
Differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 - 49 - year - old group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 cf. 32.1
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education are getting married and giving birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education tend to favour steady employment before marriage and the birth of the first child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of the different products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to other celebritiesL'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Even before it entered this selected club of actress Evangeline Lilly ('Loss') and Freud Pinto ('Million from the hut').
The gentleman's part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (The Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, formerly and now - met at the annual transmission of prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents 30 X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in his ordinary life) in 'Essé Poker' (Alphaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente).
They do not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarities, life and work), but they seek something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not spare lessons or inspiration.
This book is an excellent readership, even on repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, just as I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of the opposite, a moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nichilist, allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellectual, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the path of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odysseus published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand peaks in the universal literature that must be overcome from the north, from which the best climbers will often fall."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
By himself, he said he was the heir of a shipman from the county, another time he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the confused scream of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running before himself and calling to the future and fast speaking to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "Once she kneeled and prayed: 'My beloved God, make me stop writing as a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's poems were carved on his grave: 'After the effort comes a dream,/after the storm a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also carried his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII had followed her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing Greeks.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroja: "What else was Martin Santos going on than targeting Joyce at Baroja?
What else was it that was going on with Bennet than letting Barois execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else did Cela do but become famous for the glory of that man?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70 - year - old mother passed our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a crossbreed saved from a shelter with a weight of up to six kilograms, without a single word kicked him twice and seriously injured him.
Our indignation is greater than that we see nothing fun in such an aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was on the leash.
And to that end, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she walked with these individuals, began to fear for her own safety, because such a demon-stricken man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock, Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest commission, but we doubt that it was something to do with it, and that we do not raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
The indignation caused us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when they are entertained by the suffering of a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand where good manners, respect for animals and people have been shared.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helmet
Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both operators have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injury, if any, and death in the event of an accident on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their commitments to transport safety, which "means more than to design and produce even safer products", and confirmed that they are trying to fulfil this purpose otherwise, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the heading 'To be or not to be', is the first phase, when up to 500 repairs of motorcycles will be placed hangings to get to the attention of the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport safety is "a constant problem" for this company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November amounted to a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the figures of the patron organisation of Anfac producers and sellers of Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine a favourable figure, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles over the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, although they have been bought by private individuals, most of the purchases have been carried out by small and medium-sized companies and the scale in 100% of the cases is financing through third parties.
Additional factors such as cessation or continuation of a bad economic situation should also be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, purchasing aid 2000E has not helped much.
In addition to private individuals, mention must be made of persons engaged in a business list of small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
It was just yesterday from Ganvam that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the sales calculations for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system at the hand brake is already mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the control of the stability of the ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become compulsory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for correcting the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, working in such a way as to help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system will find after the driver has stepped down.
But he can't always hold this pressure to the end.
According to the study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers in the accident did not hit the brake before the crash and half of them did not use the brake fully.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires a maximum of the braking system, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented.
The reduction of this number would be even more significant- according to the calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting the persons-after the introduction of so-called smart hand brake systems.
In this case the vehicles will be equipped with a system which (by means of radar or camera) captures the obstacles and reports them to the drivers, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the crash cannot be prevented, the device will hit the brakes as closely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April – probably on April 8 – as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer points out that the implementation of the renewal plan for Opel will require more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan agree first with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued late in 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that Saab’s sale decision should be taken in those days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to acquire the Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars acting under the protection of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some assets to Saab of the Chinese company Baic.
It is still valid to decide to close Saab at the end of the year unless its sale is successful.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this excellent model, the Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, in the first place, the automatic download roof is in paid hand-operated operation, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; then the aluminium door, such as GT3, was used, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats by another 12 kg, thanks to the lightened 19-inch wheels of five kilograms.
And in the end, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handle with textile grips means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-way PDK transmission, one vehicle with hand-ordered six-stage gearbox, mainly on second-class roads in California, was tested in mountain sections with many tangled corners.
His conduct can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight loss does not mean that the vehicle is not printed to the asphalt.
Rather, we have not tested for such a small and light model for a long time that would at the same time convey such safety when moving in a turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of heating his muscles up during a short drive at the right time until we order him to sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Thanks to the drive that's as communicative as it is, whatever we're pointing our hands at the wheel, it's what the car does.
And do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, by 320 horses (by 10 more than Boxster S) is a very successful and can be strengthened by the option of 'sport' and by the system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used at Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or repurchase.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads we're going through with Boxster Spyder have been pretty damaged, but the car's been able to handle the drains well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while in some corners we met at the dawn of frost and gravel even in an advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, since it is more than just a modification of Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010 at a price of €70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's friend, Coco Cocoon's icon and the occasional 'starlette' at 'company' shows, the singer presents her face to an evil girl as vehemently as her own Chanel purses.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia wins in Israel
The company won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electro field, despite numerous absenteeisms in the company of Duska Ivanovice, and thus got to the head of its group after a major performance by Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was announced best in the team (29 reviews).
The company Vitoria was able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Olerson, Huertase or Mic with a large amount of deployment and collective work, although it had to endure to the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy of the 16-point circle was very much involved in the final triumph.
The match began with the front for the blues, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, they had already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli community very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Albanian team decided for the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyah, which was accepted by sand and applause when returning to its original site to increase the advantage before the beginning of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show up as the best in his 13-point team, although without six' in Splitter's assessment it was already suggested that it would not be the best night for Brazilians.
But even though the game was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their field wins, and 'with the hand of Elias' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pini definitely contributed to the 'yellow' return to the emissary (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, the injuries, but not the dead at all, needed a few precise games to take a breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which was three triples almost by itself and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs have skinned themselves in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not let anyone lose their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pini and Eidson, the best in their men, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter excluded for foul seIvanovic they did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Wounds make it impossible for Unicia to fight
Unija lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in Eurolysis in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unija, but mainly the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga society has not been threatened by the environment of Pavilion of peace and friendship, nor by rivals, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three three-points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, radiated the field with 12-18, minutes 9.
Olympicos was surprised by the intensity of the Union , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bouroussis, Uncle and Scortsanitis , turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the US Beverley and Williams resistance meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek Society began to operate and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez weighed down the Unikaj Society.
Between internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Indemnity
The third part was very aggressive by Olympiacos, who, despite losing at 19, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference between the match in Malaga Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unija tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish brewery Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unija thanks to the leadership and three-point Cook and Lewis' contribution, she left a certain hope of winning the 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympics, thanks to strengthening and transferring in centimeters in their zone, proved that it was unstoppable.
The Croatian pilot Nikola Vujcic, was able to balance the bassket overage 81-62, minute 37, and Unikaja took off and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, search engines with the largest number of classified ads in the field of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take?calculates user fees based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where it is necessary to invest a profession, years of experience, age and city where the applicant wishes to work.
During the week that the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros of gross annual and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also pays EUR 34,247 a year in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is a waiter with 11.592 euros of net annually; followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought employment on the network in the last three months is the driver, half-time employment and social worker.
Brazil sets the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to be held at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27 January 2010, when his mandate will officially end.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya telephonically.
After the November 29th elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
Finally, the operation failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum, which was sought by the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty again appeared on the markets, which should not surprise, as it is already a natural state in an environment where policymakers make decisions about a future that is uncertain of themselves.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilise the market was debt recovery through direct purchase of assets and indirect liquidity relief in the near zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually ended, and without questioning their inherent liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the fields, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore question the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterotoxic measures, and we participate in a return to risk-reduction.
The movement of the stock market and the differences in the bonds society have regained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialise private risk, which again affected public debt.
They are again pushing for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for selected investors, thereby widening the differentiation of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but Standard & Poor's arrived at that time and threatened a new revision of the decline in the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of advocates of moral risk, who have once again sought to burden the conscience of those responsible for the global economic policy with a view to halting the destructive consequences of limiting the credit for employment when it would actually be necessary to declare a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the Emirs on the restoration of power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and a new government is on its way.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconim and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from failing to meet foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to make its own citizens more transparent and commit to a shared responsibility in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of a period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, some excesses in supported positions would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as European companies' bonds, we do not need to be concerned.
If European differences decrease and ours continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to take their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 rise scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not hold out a great hope for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it's going to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, "carefully, driver friend".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán intervened first yesterday in front of a subcommittee of the Parliament, where Spain's energy strategy is currently being discussed in the next two decades.
Following his intervention followed by President Gus Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided several press comments on the proposal that he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000m euros by 2020 and another 60,000m from that date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investment would not be 60,000 million but 95,000 million.
Iberdrol actually believes that investments must focus not on increasing production capacity but on distribution networks and international connections over the next decade.
Since 2020, the issue has changed and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a law on a sustainable economy, which the government has just approved, corresponds to the line required by the company, did not want to release a vein as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "exact" measures, as President Iberdrol called them.
However, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start now, because their maturity persists and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport land services, Swiss Swiss Swissport, will play the role of Irish Airlines' preferential partner Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and Alcalá de Henares University signed a cooperation protocol for the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures yesterday
The Association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where she already works as an energy and water company.
The building in question is estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A 5km-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity for Akciona to settle in this country as a construction and concessional highway company.
The Councilwoman wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the English initial) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
Tenders are expected to be submitted in May, and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million) and compete at the last stage with three companies with a significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transparency leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct Group is in play with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed the sieve, has the name LBRJV and is involved in it by the Australian capital Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by the ACS), also by the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialised in civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises to build and privatise, but it brings with it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger mentioned above is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % share in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton’s quoted company.
Millions of assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities as an energy supplier and in the salt trade.
Among other things, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage a desalination facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure.
The underground road under the toll route, the promoter of which is the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, with the name Northern Link (northern link), is to connect the western road from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 km tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans the appointment for summer 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid journey would have opened in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia continues to bring significant profits to Hochtief, as it announced a deal with a government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
The share ACS will operate through its local Leighton subsidiary infrastructure of the national wide-band network with a fibre cable.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and will provide work for a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George Tower project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75m euros.
FCCC was allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine branch, the FCC obtained a 2.1km-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia worth EUR 64.5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after the work was done to extend the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Shit. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe.
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra for the last two years. Rushmore, for an estimated amount of EUR 3 million per year, informed the railway company.
The contract includes the possibility of extending by 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the Renfe competition, of which four of them entered the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be looking after the design and production of campaigns.
fine of 63 million for France Télécom for the restriction of competition
The French Competition Regulatory Authority imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on IFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers at the edge of regulation.
This sanctions the former French monopoly and still the state company have bought more than EUR 560 million from 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority believes that France Télécom committed a similar offence as in the past and that there was therefore a relapse.
Application trade
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barçe $476.4 million since the beginning
The League of Masters has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned $476.4 million since then, making it the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The Charter is governed by Manchester United.
The Charter is governed by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million into 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) which participated since the opening of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he won to participate, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won the main prize three times.
The Catalan contemporary champion and final winner of the missing Cup of Europe in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two cooperatives that also charged the most money for participation in the previous League of Masters.
And yet she's both lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third country that has earned the most money through the Champions, although it has obtained the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seemingly paradox is explained by the complex process in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
During this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make 1.090 million for Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, except for the additional 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There is also a premium for winning (EUR 800,000) and for the draw (EUR 400,000 for each team). Osmipinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
The champion makes $9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
The club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Bowl in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which $337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned seats.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61m euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the offer to purchase shares, with which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not undertake to make a public offering for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which it would pay in 10 years and for which interest would be paid for this deferral 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos’s shares ended trading at EUR 1.85; hence Nueva Rumasa’s offer valued the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerusalem Group shall provide a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in the sale of the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the Sos capitalisation is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the verge of possible bids for the purchase and settlement of the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jorda as Head of Internal Audit was announced.
This Decision constitutes the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, since the company is still sunk in the legal battle of the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers.
In fact, there is no way to shorten the possibility that in the coming months the Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As regards the Salazar loan, the former members of the Board of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicha representatives) yesterday testified and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were going.
CNMV allows the exclusion option of Patternina, which participated in Inversor Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion of Inversor Mer from Federico Paternin on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its conditions met the applicable standards and considered that the "sufficient" content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the revisions introduced on 2 December was "sufficient".
CNMV pointed out that the offer is aimed at obtaining $550.008 shares from Federica Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilised which could not be transferred in any way until an offer had been concluded which specified that the price had been fixed by Federic Paternin in accordance with the rules in force.
New Automotive Valuation Instruments
In these days, there are storms and accidents that don't just make money on auto-services.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are dragged to a service where the expert has to estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be long and complex work.
It can take two or three hours to calculate the repair costs manually from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labour.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance shall devote themselves to the collection of information provided to them by manufacturers in order to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatax, Solera is the leading company; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and sector information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velazquez, commercial director of Audatax, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hot job because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "extrude" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a miniature car, it may take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
In terms of the rolling stock in circulation, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specialises in specific brands.
National headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than 100 technicians (normal mechanics) working with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous flow of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repairs and maintenance, but according to each country there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
With a view to the products offered by Audatax, it is easy to obtain support from professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution to the valuation of insurance events designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or the lacquer.
This instrument shall apply according to application to each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it less than ten times per month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatax.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for the full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came from the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows vehicles to be excluded with a general insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or finding deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many model brands have been serviced due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered during a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and a solution to the assessment of car damage, accidents or maintenance
Gt Guia appreciation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 accounted for 10.8m euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalising the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audatex was created in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The worldwide invoicing of Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group stood on the $1,000 million stock exchange and now its shares are estimated at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crash vehicles
Last October, Solera bought an Autoonline, an Internet base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged the entry of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, lenders, services, the sale of spare parts and professional sellers who must register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are outstanding among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day on the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed cannot return to operation but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historical value may be authorised to operate, although they have been excluded, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller instrument, Audatax guarantees that the user will only receive the budget in four steps: vehicle identification, spare parts search, budget creation and budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of an older age who are more or less restrained in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 field, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with Internet connection is needed for use.
After identifying the model to be fixed, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model will appear and then the necessary replacement part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of labour, allowances or discounts, and then print and pass them on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument of appreciation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service oriented and does not include an estimate of labour.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year that the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows for example to select a door and turn it around to show the inside.
