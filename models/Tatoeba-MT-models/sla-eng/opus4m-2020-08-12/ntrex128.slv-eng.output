Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the proposal to name themselves as members of the Welsh Parliament.
This was due to plans for the Assembly’s name to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned about smiling.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that they were concerned in their group “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of the Hall of Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and proposed other options.
Valižan conservative said that his group was “open spirit” regarding the change of name, while warning that there was a small difference in the pronunciation between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire word.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing draft legislation for the presentation of changes to the name, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by the members themselves.”
By law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly was empowered to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valižan Parliament.
The Commission has chosen the name Welsh Parliament Member or WMP as members of the Assembly, but in the public consultation the most support has been given to the possibility of MWP.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who will have to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the non-compatibilities of the role of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their designation.
Macedonians to decide by referendum to change state name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens insisted that the name of their northern neighbour represented the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, plebiscite opponent for the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is just the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s church were silent, as churches in Harlem are struggling with problems
“The older people I talked to say that they used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are different today.
The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbors, where people regularly go.”
In the churches, however, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and will soon be back to square one.
He added that the churches could be replaced with residential buildings by joint administrations (condominiums), where people who would not help the captives in the neighbourhood who remained.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites,” he said, “and that is why the day will come quickly when all these churches will close, since it is unlikely that the people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decades later.
The original White Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that served nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by the Black Religious Community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of vendors who did not want to hire or support black people.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned the renovation, they ordered knocking bells.
David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bells “bells for poor people”.
In July, the expert named them “cultural treasure” and “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-polt musician, Dionysio A. Link, who went to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where we hit on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he wasn't replaced in St. Martin's church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story with architects and contractors has been taking place in the past few months; some have been brought by church laymen and others by bishops.
The parish’s administrative body, composed of laymen, wrote to the bishops in July to worry that the bishops would “try to bear the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the bishop.
A shark harmed a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old man during lobster hunting at the opening of lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had sunk with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help and then sailed with the group to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught a lobster and then found out that he was screaming “He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had the whole keyhole torn open.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’, he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
An ambulance, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that a shark was spotted a few weeks earlier in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
Responsible for 48 hours denied access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s coming to Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beautiful spots such as the stores, and with professional staff.
As part of entering the British beauty market, which is worth GBP 2.8 billion and is still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, larger beauty spots will be tested in 11 shops around the country and more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used previously for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say that they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3,000 products and include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its boutique offer of cosmetic products, so most products are vegan – something younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will test its concession in two Sainsbury stores. The first week opened in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
The online shopping and daily purchase of smaller food in local shops require more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail trade would be similar to wholesalers as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group opened the Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also the Habitat trade, since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and took over was more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s engaged in a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the link ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sale three years ago by GBP 125 million to its 281-store pharmaceutical company, Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as they were supposed to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful spots and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially qualified colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beautiful destination, which presents a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is "angry" because Holly Willoughby is out of a £11 million business.
The Star of Dragons Dan (Good Business) is furious because Holly Willoughby, the television director, withdrew from a £11 million business with his brand of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of this Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of the Dragons Dan Peter Jones show because at the last minute she withdrew from their lucrative business with a lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “angry” when a golden television girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new business — worth up to £1.5 million — there is no longer enough time to focus on their brand of clothes and Truly’s accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted to double its assets, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the farthest thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely amazed all involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlowe’s headquarters.’
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company several million dollars due to major investments in products, from mud and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple were on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I’m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticisms of the media because of a comment that some felt “non-presidential” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
Trump said with his mocking "new" voice:
“I didn’t give in to anything.”
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "appropriate response" to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he stressed that the US was continuing with sanctions that continued to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic about his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results — stopping rocket testing, helping free hostages, and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded full-scale scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said and pointed to the crowd right in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds more dead
For example, when addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were displaced, they did not declare a natural disaster, a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is a little complicated,” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization consists of a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can help on the ground.
Sutopou, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paluy and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Since earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the state remains completely unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although they built tsunami shelters in Aceh, this is not a common practice on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Paluy probably contributed to the loss of lives, although a warning was given.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship, anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, sails towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his electoral campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit presents a problem for Joko's administration in re-election next year.
Grief also faces pressure from long - term tensions among sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hit a late match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, with a score of 89 minutes.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's appetizer 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal at the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at a remote gate.
The arrow traveled high above the penal area towards the right upper right corner of the neck.
In the end, the ball went down through Kepa Arrivabalaga's doorman and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it as far as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanta coming, so after one touch I didn't think much anymore and simply decided to shoot.«
Chelsea led 1-0 in half with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Attacker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic and fled to Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly passed in the middle and ran ahead.
Then he gave it nicely through the defense, and Hazard fled to the penal area.
Hazard overran the defense and fired a left-hand shot at a remote gate through the front door of Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will compete with Napoli at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group section of the Champions League.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, reported by the State Accident Agency on Sunday morning.
A representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that a number of people were caught in the ruins of buildings due to a 7.5 earthquake Friday.
Palu, who has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is buried in the ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police launched a murder investigation after they found the body of a woman in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 p.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and was arrested by a 32-year-old man for suspected murder.
The police are calling on everyone who's been in the area who's seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its initial phase, but I invite everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to come in contact with us.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the CCTV footage to get in touch with us, because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police representative confirmed that the woman was a Birkenhead resident and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew a woman and asked where they had found her this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police are informing the women's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back into his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take hours before they could enter again.
The police heard him explain to the man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one right outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information request that they write at @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, indicating journal 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has become the latest commemorative target of the “rewriting of history” dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatic Puritanists.
However, Cromwell Society referred to Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "trying to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Today’s debate on the removal of statues has made it clear that Oliver Cromwell’s image will become a target outside the Westminster Palace.”
The iconoclasm in the English civil wars of Cromwell has neither ordered nor performed.
Perhaps Cromwell will be wrongly sacrificed for the actions of his forefather in the last century.
The excellent presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell’s 19th - century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even later in the 19th century than today) as a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course a monarchy.
Whether this is a purely accurate show is the subject of constant historical debate.
Clearly, in the mid - 17th century, the conflict formed the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from when he was Lord Protector also deserve celebration and remembrance.”
A murderous pig killed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, in the market in the southwest of China, a pig attacked and killed a farmer.
On Sunday, a man who was identified only by the name “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood near a piggy at a market in Lipunanshui, Guizho Province, reported in the South China Morning Post newspaper.
The pig farmer is preparing for the vaccination of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting, she and her cousin were scheduled to travel from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of a neighbor piglet was open.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody sponge in it.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig killed a farmer to death.
“Brother's legs were bloody and mutilated,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted as saying in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were locked up so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were gathering evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering severe bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually offensive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“We would just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown sufficient respect," he said.
To the southwest of the U.S. due to the remains of Hurricane Rosa, heavy rain is coming
According to forecasts, the hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the worse.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is from a week of 5.00 a.m. to the east of the hurricane category 1 at a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-air pressure zone is being strengthened over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baia California peninsula Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure area, will create abundant rainfall in the wider south-west area in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and the possibility of earth’s reptiles in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of precipitation in some places will reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, mainly above much of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Floods are possible because of the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into shallow rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust into the air.
The approaching low air pressure zone will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be precipitation above 12 mm, which may result in a slight delay of flooding and slippery road.
This will be the first rain for the region in a rainy period.
Several scattered tropical surfaces will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings early, late Mondays, and on Tuesdays the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
Great temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States in October, as the Arctic is cooling and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees in difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most Central and Eastern United States will enter warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, they could have 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C] on Tuesday, about 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the US east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people on six television networks saw the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that was due to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's turnover in the last minute: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was feeling her guilt and tried to take her off at the high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a gruesome testimony that he was 100% convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday's testimony is supposed to mirror more than 20.4 million people.
The company considered the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
To facilitate the performance, the ratings are similar to those of the final football game or the award of the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel, which is strongly supported by the leaders of Kavanaugh's appointment, leads to a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In the second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement to vote in favour of Kavanough, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded protesters screaming at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend the Justice Committee hearings.
During the construction, he hung up a few minutes of sightings, caught live by CNN television cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have the power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement and added that he would speak more at the committee hearing and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if they agreed to investigate the charges against the candidate the minority party of the Democrats was calling for in the next week.
Flake was persuaded to talk to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, in part.
After talking to Coons and several other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Investigation Office (FBI) of the Kavanaugh indictment.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses criticism of "playing political games" in brexito
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her exit plans from the European Union of "playing political games" with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexite Plan and said that the proposal was that Britain and the EU pay for the customs of each other “is completely absurd.”
Shooting at Wayde Sims: police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of the death of a LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU team.
After reporting to the Baron Rouge police, Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
The police found the sunglasses on the scene, and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS is complementing WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police filed a statement admitting that he shot Wade to death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
An East Baton Rouge Parish investigator issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the special unit for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
The LSU team's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "care and justice search".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 201-centimeter gunman grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
On average, the previous season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU team coach Will Wade said that the team was “shocked” and “shocked” because of Wayne's death.
“This is what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano vomits ashes on Ciudad de Mexico
The ash vomited by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico’s capital city.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano as the activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquakes.
Images on social networks depicted thin layers of ash covering windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increased activity in a volcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital city after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors who support independence faced anti-emergency police units and joined thousands of people in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised vote on secession.
A group of masked Separatism supporters, held by anti-accident police units, were throwing eggs and throwing paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later there were also fights, and police officers had to use the pendulums to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who cried out for hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, faced protestors who supported unity and shouted “Let Spain live!”
According to local media, 14 people in protests have been injured more easily.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by the Catalonian separatists, tensions remain in the region that supports independence.
A large majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although participation was low, as opponents of the secession boycotted the elections to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting on voters in the region in violent conflicts.
Groups that support independence camped overnight in front of voters to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
»Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although close regional elections last December, it is difficult for the Catalonian parties supporting independence to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders in voluntary exile are either awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest had fuelled politics on both sides.
“The tension is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the end of last year prior to the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To run in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men running into a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested for flying into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the door was damaged and the building itself was damaged.
At some point, we're supposed to be shooting at the car with a crossbow.
With a Menga hit, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingstone guaranteed a victory
He had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach at the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengai's arrow made a difference, as Gary Holt's team leveled with the Hibernian team in second place.
As a result, Gerrard’s team lost a victory in the guests of this year’s championship, and the next Sunday, Hearts, who leads on a scale behind which they are behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone increased his number of indisputables in the division in six games, and chief coach Holt, who last month replaced Kenny Miller, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingstone has wasted opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead well before the hit, because they were causing a lot of problems with their proximity to Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but he sent the ball across the door, then Alan Lithgow hit the front door, and Craig Halkett shot the goal with his head.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests when they interrupted the attack.
And that's how they got the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and struck from the middle of the criminal scene.
The Rangers had more ball possession, but the domestic defenses couldn't get through, and doorman Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, defended Scott Pittman's shot with his leg, and Lithgow fired past the goal from another Livingstone break.
The motions continued to come to Livingstone's penal area, but the locals refused all the attacks, two misdemeanors – Halkett's misdemeanor over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the crime of hand-playing – but the judge did not.
"Excellent performance" of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingstone.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the statute have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt needs to be credited for the way he woke the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ready all the time.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are outstanding under Gerrard’s leadership, they miss these standards very much.
There were no shots at the goal – only once they successfully beat the host defense – and this is some kind of wake for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixedly in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish approach to the EU.
He then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering before the mosque, but a number of supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Several hundred protestors, including many Kurds, did not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect a separation of visitors, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as a freeway.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist fatally crashed in a car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident took place near a crossroads between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. after British summertime.
The car driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident took place only a few months after the biker died in a collision in which the car driver fled, on Childers Street, about a mile [1.5 km] from the Saturday accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so that they can notify their relatives.
They set up roadblocks and diverted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in the incident
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a strictly guarded male prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. after British summer time and is still underway.
They called on the police from the Tornado unit to take care of an incident involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the spot with minor injuries on their faces.
The prison staff representative said: “We have called a specially qualified staff to take care of the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police will take responsibility for it and may be even longer behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called in an anti-disaster police unit to mediate a serious incident in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest desert and carries the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of the sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Orcan Rosa is supposed to be furious with Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
The hurricane Katrina (1967) raged well 60 kilometres from the Arizona border.”
The latest models of the national centre for hurricanes include 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm of precipitation is expected, individual precipitation up to 100 mm is possible.
For areas beyond the dangers of sudden floods, the rain of the hurricane Rosa may be a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of the precipitation is likely to be useful, as it is currently a dry season in the southwest.
“According to the American Drought Tracking Centre, a good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, ” reports weather.com.
The route of the hurricane Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of the hurricane at a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 miles [620 km] south of Punta Eugenie, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected to reach the mainland in Mexico by the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great threat to the flood.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with 250 mm of precipitation,” reports the weather.com website.
The Orcan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and towards South Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Ross or his remains is abundant rain on the peninsula of Baja Caliphonia in northwestern Sonora and in the American Southwestern desert,” said the National Center for the Hurricanes.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earth’s reptiles in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspected attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the area of Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset police.
Police officers are asking anyone who might have caught the event on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “animosity and anger” from a democratic party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unheard of tactics of the democratic party,” Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered “animosity and anger” from a democratic party in the process of its appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage".
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an extraordinary record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' election participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really trying with the candidacy," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump claims that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment was scheduled to take place on Friday at the latest, CNN said to the Republican Party's adviser.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims is increasing.
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had died in an earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom had been swept off the coast by giant waves.
On Friday, more than 100 people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when six - foot - long [6 m] waves struck the coast at dark and many died and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When tsunamis came into danger yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Tsunami did not come alone, he carried cars, trees, houses, he tore everything to the ground,” explained Nugroho and added that the tsunami was travelling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Paluy.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, curved and broken bridges and mosses surrounded by water.
The quakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, they felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during Friday's severe earthquake is about 200 times the power of the atom bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “large-scale” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Paluy, in the Donggal area closer to the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugroho has already said, communications have been completely cut off and do not have any information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that it had harmed Palu, but officials say that the waves came just at the time of issuing the warning.
On an amateur video published on social networks, a man on the top floor screams a warning to people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall collided along the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
They couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video at Reuters.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power outage that cut communication around Palujo, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities report that the army has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still badly need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Paluy on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, World Vision members from Dongala arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard set up shelters outside their premises, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of devastation.
“They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with many experiences would not be allowed to come to Palo.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stocks and staff assistance shall be permitted only if the site of the accident is declared a national accident area.
That's not what's happened.
“It is still considered an accident at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriana, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing are hopeful that their immediate miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble, and her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian naval paratrooper, trained two missing sailing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others, captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students, according to Mr. Mandagi.
“As an old man in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon remembers that in the hours when news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulating around the board of paragliders, he was desperate to send messages in the application WhatsApp to contestants in Paluje who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray hook, instead of two blue.
“I think this means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee
After reporting to the police in Newport, the thieves stole $26,750 from the security guard Brink’s, who filled the ATM in Newport on the Leeve centre on Friday morning.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a public statement.
While employed, another man “approached Brink’s security staff from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, more suspects were seen fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should call the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was sent on Saturday on Twitter and he wrote: "The Being With the Official Name of Kanye West."
He also used the nickname Ye for his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he was scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who cancelled the performance for "personal reasons", said the director of the show.
The word shortens his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that the most commonly used word in the Bible is "you" (i.e.), West said at the beginning of this year when he was talking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I are all of us.
Kanye, which means “one”, I have changed into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
The name of Sean Combs was Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former associate of West's, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico swore he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the armies to oppress the Mexican people.
At a time when left-wing student movements began in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people in peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal groups.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it spends on research in this area, says the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their aim is to become the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty good for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence would take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, President of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the top American player Othello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the robot contest organised by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would be able to find the next visionaries more easily.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed the best of universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrow committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything in months.
Macedonians to decide at referendum to change state name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum to change their country's name to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”. This would resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement on the basis of a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 per cent as long as it is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by agreeing with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
Change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission reported that no irregularities had been reported by 13:00.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and son, Duško, presented their votes for the referendum in Macedonia in Strumica on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be “the confirmation of our future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that a referendum would take place between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second survey conducted by Macedonian television Thelma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the election must be 50 % plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy to take over last May's mandate.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has overtaken Brighton's entire defense and won
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday, winning Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguerre's score in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the tray in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal scene.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English attacker returned the ball to Aguerre with his first touch in the penal space, beating Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan with his right leg and sending the ball to the right of the net.
“Aguero is dealing with problems in his legs,” said coach Pep Guardiola to the press.
«We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue blue an initial advantage in the first English league duel.
He scored in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Saney nicely on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times and then sent the ball to Sterling to the remote gate.
The blue shooter pushed the ball into the net just before it hit the goal.
On Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group section of the Champions League, will meet Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and ruin their chance to address them.
The Nationals team is out of the picture, so there's no particular reason for a new attack.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the roller coaster against the team Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the finals, because in the West League they have the advantage over the team of Los Angeles Dodgers.
On Friday with a victory of 5:2 over the Nationals team, the Rockys provided the least invitation to the organizer, but are still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we'll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals haven't released the name of the first pitcher for Sunday, but it's likely he'll be metal Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who's going to be the first metal for the first time on Thursday, is a metal as a pregnant player, and by Sunday, he would have had enough days of rest.
This season, the Washington right-winger gathered 18 victories and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 discharges with a blow in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The President indirectly touched on the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
These will be one of the biggest – I am really trying with the candidacy, so I am fighting everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening right now.
They're determined to take power again, using every means possible, and you can see the rudeness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said and called the Democrats “angry, evil, low and false.”
Namely, he highlighted a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, with a voice of disapproval from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, wait. This was really a bad word from the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She is impatient for those who express their opinions.
When a momentum activist in my local party told me I didn't trust him, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a number of members of the Labour Party Parliament, who are not welcome to express their opinion.
My colleague, Mrs. Joan Ryan, had a similar experience because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, there was an untrustworthy motion for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In the eight years that I am a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today most meetings do not use such a tone and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and that any opinion assesses whether this is acceptable to the customer’s leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues I previously thought we shared similar political views were expecting me to change my mind and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks calling for non-election, condemning the policy of the environment and telling me that I shouldn't be in a labor party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm making are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet daily with a flood of sexist or racist insults, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a labor party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each proposal of a non-believer or amendment of the rules of choice, the party is becoming more narrow.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not to be so loud, and I will be "all right".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago – the reason for this was the negligence of Thaci's government, which led the classroom in my elementary school to literally collapse – I, as a local councilman or government minister, have tried to stand up for better public services for those most in need.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas that I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that I do not understand their desire to waste my time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing against Brexite, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat to my choice or political propriety will deter me from acting in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to the top of the scale
Two late attempts have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in this wonderful championship game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale and they're the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, the weight on the home side was hung by their superior defense and better exploiting the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“We have been through a lot of tests in our previous matches and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayra’s team, opportunities have taken better advantage than we have.”
The strike of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow chart for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, represented a number of overpowers for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted the attempt without conversion.
At the time of the offense, Climo increased the lead for Ayr, before he hit right at half-time and then converted the independent attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose very well started the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggott reduced the backlog to five points.
It was followed by a long break due to the serious injury to Ruaridh Knott that was carried off on the stretchers, and Ayr continued to make progress with the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who turned Clima.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with Bruce Colvin's unconverted attempt at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card due to the interference of the Air without the ball, MacPherson scored the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent a wingman named Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the hosts.
The star of the Still Game series begins a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series appears to be entering the restaurant, at least to become the director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a longtime partner in comedy by Greg Hemphill.
Two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Adraftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the “flower restaurant” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There's a sea of blue flags on the public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titika to Amazon are covered with a slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.”
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict due to the natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the yearning for a new voyage across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which they will receive after five years of consultation on 1 October.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit, expects results,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of unstable talks, Chile must negotiate the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial battle next year for re-election, also has high expectations about Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will not decide for Bolivia’s sake — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after they listened to the final arguments means that the case was “not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they may cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” said Zárateev.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric from Chile has sucked up all the goodwill that may have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in discussions.
The state hasn't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia a “extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139-year-old differences with each other” said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivaria will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea has declared that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States called on them to fulfil their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is wrong to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition to the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to secure the forecast without first taking decisive measures to disarm it.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pyongjang is serious about giving up the weapons that the country sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers that come to shops with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not have to look forward.
In their spring and summer 2019 collections, Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a collection of oddly large covers that blinded the style on the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the very impractical covers flooded Instagram, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine's piece, which was the most outstanding, was a beige hat with wide shorts decorated with feathers similar to those in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a witch’s hat and even pineapple — but your head will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks — just the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to the breather and eyeglass diving equipment, and the other one looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the giant covers will come to the store near you.
The broad hats closely follow “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter shorts was observed in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label for the extremely impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another great creation along the fashion runway — a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model in the swimsuits she was wearing.
On the Paris week of fashion, the centrepiece of the La Riviera collection of the designer Jacques for spring/summer 2019 was a bag made of white leather.
The famous Stilist Luke Armitage said of F EMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to arrive at the store next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for too many supplements would be difficult to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills are key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results on exams, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career and the place they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement an adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable choice subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the conversation is a memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother tongue, his words are entwined in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that the languages at the top of the scale are with the highest performance rates in independent schools.
68 percent of foreign - language students achieved excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 Scottish Schools of the Independent Schools Council (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved excellent grades in Mandarin and that 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of pupils in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish received excellent grades.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for the reasons why employers are tortured to fill vacancies, 17 per cent of them can be attributed to language shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, there is a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouTube survey, covering more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 per cent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is 15 per cent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be the most important to the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages in independent schools taught by experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' jersey
For fans who look forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, waiting will soon be over.
The coach of Lakers Luke Walton predicted that James would play in the Sunday opening game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one and less than 48," explained Walton on the official Lakers team website.
The official rapporteur for Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers before the season.
“I don’t need racing before the season at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a series of conventions in his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned conventions in the coming week, including the stops in his favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for office in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress following the November vote.
What time is Trump's convention in West Virginia, and where will he be able to see it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place on Saturday 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern time.
The Trump convention in West Virginia can be seen live on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to be talking about the hearings of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who have become tense over sexual misconduct charges, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be postponed for one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, gain a new impetus.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, these five assemblies were dedicated to “incentivizing volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The supervision of Congress is so important for its programme that the President will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult season of the campaign,” said Reuters, a representative of Trump’s campaign, who does not want to be appointed.
Today’s convention in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract the interest of Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and “lift” him in public research,” said Reuters, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still has a desire to win and keep hope from Sunday's individual duel
After three one-sided games, it may have been the Saturday afternoon duel of two (foursome) couples that needed this year’s Ryder Cup.
The swinging swing is a completely fabricated sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where's the swing gone now?
“They had six points of advantage and now they have four, so this is probably a new impetus for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage because it leads to four points and twelve more can get them.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have the wind in their sails, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was destined from the initial blow to the green and set a good example.
The shouts of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and I were left behind with two points equal in the fourth game.
The strike that brought them the victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that the American team still has a chance.
“You just need to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to glory.
In the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup, are the only players with multiple points.
An unusual but charming two Europes have won four out of four and are infallible.
The two Mollywoods were the only ones who didn't hit the boogies on Saturday afternoon, and the boogies also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy between them and the noisy audience seems to flow, confirm that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe's possible victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
And if possible, both at the same time on different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
The Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noreen.
Bugs and two double buggies in the first nine holes caused the Spanish and Sweden to fall into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and a duel of two is an exception to being closely monitored for communication between couples, advice they give, advice they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the duels of the two have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have questioned.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe is going on the last day of Ryder's Cup with a nice advantage after Saturday's four-ball games and two-two fights leading with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National, he scored four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, had in the morning four-ball games power over the U.S. team that sinned, and led in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in the two-two fights, where two games won, but they couldn't catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single fights if they want to keep the trophy.
The first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (the couple named "Mollywood") after the sensational end of the week only the second couple to win four points in their first four games in the history of Ryder's Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they reenacted and even more convincingly defeated spent Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who was dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a moment, but lost 19 out of 29 games in four-ball games and two-two fights, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duels of two pairs and in pairs with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coeopka, who are ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest part of Paris, everything did not go as planned by the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new standard for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they decisively won against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and then came back and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two-two fights, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team came back after four points behind each other's duels, although Fury's team only needs an equalization to keep the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem to be too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will never unilaterally disarm”
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions was causing growing mistrust in the United States of America and that under such conditions North Korea would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had adopted a number of “significant measures in good faith” in the past year, such as halting the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, undermining the city for nuclear experiments, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the US”, he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be convinced of national security, and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated the famous complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of progressive measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjongjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea wants to see the official end of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pjongjang must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to call for the release of the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States insists that we must first disarm nuclear weapons and step up the pressure with sanctions in order to achieve our goals by force and even object to the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
“The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who do not know us at all.
The problem is that further implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president pointed out at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jae In, which took place in the past five months, and added: "If the problem of nuclear disarmament were not discussed with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have agreed to such a dead spot."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was quite different from that of last year when Trump Kim, the General Assembly of the United Nations, told them that the attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump Kim, “Mr. Evil President”, was designated as a “racquet man” on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage at the United Nations Assembly in taking disarmament measures, but said that he still had much work to do and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea disarmed nuclearly.
On Wednesday Trump said that there was no time frame for this, and said: "It may take two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The imposition of sanctions on the Security Council must proceed decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeii met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongjang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
In July, he announced that progress had been made and that North Korea had already criticised him in a few hours, if his demands were to be “gangster”.
North Korea has committed itself to undermine the missile testing station and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate measures" at its meeting with Mun this month.
He was supposed to tell Tim that the “appropriate measures” meant the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of the new Harvard University course this year is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course they want to fight against the growing mastic culture of the “cellocellular” learning, where power is accumulated by caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that according to his first such species in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I only know this now that I’m in my senior year?”
She said no one's ever told her how important sleep is, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
This year's course talks about the key importance of good sleeping habits for learning and sports success, as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, says that this course was decided when they found out that the students were significantly short of sleep during the week.
The single course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the door of the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, however, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons of the participant encourages thinking about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn about these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarettes are affected by their health," added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that a culture of pride is still present in the case of “survival all night learning”. He adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also avoid weight gain – the brain, due to lack of sleep, becomes hungry, making students constantly hungry.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop a course. Last year he attended one of the professor's lectures in Harvard during his first year.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student community.
He hopes that in the next phase, he will be able to ask his graduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition facility.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a wake-up caller as well as a wake-up call. He also wishes to draw attention to the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as it can cause imbalances of the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingstone : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sank the hopes of Gerard's team
Rangers defeated again in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston sentenced Steven Gerrard's announced team to defeat with 1:0.
The team from Ibrox hunted their first guest victory after February's reign at St. Johnstone Stadium at 4:1, but Gary Holt's team scored second in 18 matches since Gerrard led the team, with his team for the lead team of the Scottish League lagging eight points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected rangers did not seem to want to equalize.
The Rangers fell into a common position, and Livingstone made his third move, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team was left behind.
The Rangers' problem was not over. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when an object arrived after reporting from the guest team's fan site.
Gerrard took eight shifts on the crew that easily defeated Ayr and joined the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt held onto the verified Livingstones, who had taken away the point of the Hearts team a week earlier, and he was no doubt impressed by the way in which his flight team effectively neutralized all the attempts of the guests.
The Rangers, though, had higher ball ownership, but Livingstone made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short shot, and then he went after Allan McGregor's goal, but the tie was inconclusive and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game pointed more to hope than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after a hit with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, there should have been a penalty shot, but Judge Steven Thomson wiped out the Colombian's demands.
In the first half, Rangers managed to put only two shots into the goal, but not the head shot that Lassano Coulibaly sent against the goal, nor the batting ball of Ovie Ejari, were any danger to doorman Liam Kelly.
Livingstone’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already completely deserving because of his persistence.
Rangers couldn't cash in another Jacobs long-stretched plugin.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's tray for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard acted and exchanged Coulibaly's vacation with wingman Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be serving Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more dishes before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inconclusive after passing from the corner.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the opportunity to take a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: The inventor of Geiger's counter
We present the page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, who later became a world famous physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
In the scientific world, it became a permanent site, and it also gained its place in pop culture, such as the 1950 Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Male: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that the radioactivity in materials has on atoms.”
Evans: "Damn it, now they're really answering!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the attack cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy the attack cells
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognise the attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of patient’s immune cells, which are subsequently changed in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer and then return to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system how to recognise the attack cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of patient’s immune cells, which are changed in the laboratory to “see” HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several different types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells in patients “teached” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West performed on the SNL with a counter-trafficking point marked MAGA on the cap.
The Communion Was Not Delighted
Kanye West was fluttered in the Saturday Night Live studio after a freakish point, during which he expressed his support to US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the presidential chair.
After performing the third song of his performance, "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the title "Make America Great Again", West launched an attack on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” right.
This time the SNL broadcast began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor deluded himself from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue wasn't played, but it was uploaded into the social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems with the inscription on his hat.
"They came after me at the stage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat."
I've been harassed!
And they say I'm lost," he said after Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to wear “Superman’s Clothing because it means that no one can order me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love.”
His comments were prepared by the audience at least twice for whistleblowers and the members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone also said of Vanity: “There was a death silence in the studio.”
At the last minute, West was invited by a goat to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West has already caused a lot of surprise with a video for the song “I Love It”, where he wore the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SINGLE PARAJI.”
The head of Karen Hunter's talk show tweeted that West is simply "what it is, and that's just fine.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and expands the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would now be “a being formally known as Kanye West. I am now Ye.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, he's already done it before him, he's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as Prince.
Male accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must report to a court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harrington has starkly gone against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for his swinging sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medievally colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a mastic hero says that due to the appearance of such roles on the screens, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with hard-livedness.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #IzEven period.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old playmate from the Rose Leslie Game of Thrones, admitted to having strong beliefs on this subject.
“I personally seriously wonder at the moment where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What have we taught men during our growing up about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of men due to the display of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What has been born and learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this particular aspect of manhood?
I think one of the important issues of our time is how can we change that?
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In his interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in recording any pre-story or continuation of the Game of Thrones, because he “completed with battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard performance, which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose, on the tape.
“For this series I met my wife, so in some way she gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Keith's character Jon Snow, in a fantasy series with Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual relations, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials from the conference in Junan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is still increasing by 100,000 annually in China.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a very pressing problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT remains very common.
As conservative values still apply in the country, according to research, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men marry women over time.
The disease is often tolerated due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to medicines to treat HIV as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have issued data on Republican senators, condemns “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected charges that a member of her staff had published information about three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A L.A. Democrat claimed that these charges came from individuals and websites on the far right.
"Lesses, lies and even more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is said to include home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of the U.S. state of Utah.
This data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate meeting on charges of sexual harassment of a candidate for Supreme Judge, Brett Kanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators had completed their interrogation of Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that via IP it is possible to identify the source of the publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters' office and to conclude that the information was published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” Waters continues.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false accusations, are by no means responsible for leaking this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies.”
The statement by Senator Waters quickly came across criticism on the Internet, including by former White House representative Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial of the branch of anger", wrote Fleischer.
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes for the city of Waters in the mid-term elections, spoke on Twitter.
“If this is true, it’s serious”, he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her cabinet had informed “the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities about these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and is also applicable to the revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy, which came to the screen for the first time in 2003 with Johnny English titled Johnny English and continuing in 2011 titled Johnny English 2.
Is there going to be a fun saturar about how shitty we are, a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English, with its eyes full and unusual faces, gets permission to remix the vermin; already his name indicates that it is a comic figure created for a cinematographic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It is an awkward undercover agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveler and international mystery man who once played Atkinson in the now forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wore a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves concerned his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since “serious” films, like 007 or Mission impossible now without bad conscience, offer comic elements.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not so much for adults, and for me, Johnny English's reflective experiences are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent leaps in Mr Bean's role.
It is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the web network of British top secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to a competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of the break for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already experienced a break due to political disfavor: Emma Thompson has tried with the role of alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the script that she can help herself with.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so it has to decide on one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who informally teaches how to operate under cover: here the writers hit, as English performs some sort of spy “rock academy”.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets with a longtime associate of Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotyped sports enthusiast, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems in the name of the secret service of Her Majesty, and they are meeting the fatalist Ophelio Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenka.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waiter set fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when they snuck onto the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for a supposed reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of Walt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, it reminds us of the children’s film despite their sympathy and vigor.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help myself here, and I think, is the British film Atkinson capable of giving a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour deny that the British are planning a four-day working week, with pay for a five-day working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment for five days.
The party from the corporate leaders wants the savings that companies create from the revolution of artificial intelligence to be poured into workers and given them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three - day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the customer's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review was due to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is a goal that we will strive to achieve through the customer's approach to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the customer's overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week working week campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a client’s policy and the party does not think about it.”
In the shadow of John McDonnell, he used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take the power out of the community of "free-at-air directors" and "receivers".
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party could impose “debates” on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors and the introduction of the Funds for Equity Integration, thus transferring 10 % of the share in private enterprises to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the 60 minutes (60 minutes) show whether their opinion could be altered by the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI.
The investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the author of the 60-minute show asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change her mind about.
Kennedy thought it was more open than a South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this charge came, I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, unreserved, unquestionable.”
And Graham's voice seems to be carved into stone.
“I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,” he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival, and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event with a truly exceptional type of stars and with the same outstanding mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Grand Line of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Citizens' Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “acts”, such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How successful, though, is the Global Citizen movement, which has remained for 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is it just another example of what is called “clictivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the status of signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters have been recorded in the effort for a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than US$ 37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions was 390 commitments and communications that had already paid or collected at least USD 10 billion.
The Group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to "helping children to realize their full potential", which the Rwandans promised $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets of the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can be put in historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Food Partnership at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been carried out by the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government had announced that it would co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children by means of food measures.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
the movement Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform this year's event in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
The United States could use the US Ministry of the Interior to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner newspaper, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinka said that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East, “if necessary”.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do so. The Navy will ensure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to prevent Russian energists from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants in the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group called the "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less the impact on fuel and its replacement”, he said, calling Russia “a pony that knows one trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration is trying to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, where it is expected to push Russia out, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's government, including President Donald Trump of the United States himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inadequate” pipeline project North Stream 2, which is supposed to make Berlin a “talent” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is an unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same position that energy must not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Involvement of a third country in our energy supply is a major problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Union (BDI), following a recent meeting between Chancellor Angelo Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" her candidacy in the election for US President in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "exactly study" her candidacy for President of the United States after the mid-term elections.
In a city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her candidacy.
“It’s time for them to go to Washington women and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman’s leader,” said Officer The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine my candidacy for President."
At a meeting in the city house, Warren built President Donald Trump as "this country is supposed to lead in the wrong direction".
“What Donald Trump does to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren has already openly criticised Trump and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before the elections, we need an FBI investigation."
However, a survey published Thursday showed that most of its own voters felt that Warren's position should not be contested in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the “probable” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had greater support for the candidacy, with 38% of respondents supported it and 48% opposed it.
The other high-ranking Democrats who would have come under the auspices of the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said, following a report from Associated Press, that he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned a post-traumatic stress disorder called Track Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after returning connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s son’s arrest was marked “the elephant in the salon” and said that her son and other veterans were returning slightly changed, sober, wondering where respect was for what the warlords and the airmen and all other members of the army had donated to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of a weapon in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Vasila.
18 federal states and the District of Colombia support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new American policy that denies asylum rights to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district in question filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, which the American Union for Civil Liberties Against Federal Policy has not published.
She said that her partner and his "violent sons, members of the gang", had abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The federal prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications in the United States come as countries that are constantly coping with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Committee on the Calls of Immigrants, which allowed unrecorded immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor of Columbia County, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "refused decades of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such a prohibition violates this principle,” the Court states.
Public prosecutors further stated in the request that policies that deny immigrants the right of entry harm the American economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and should "provide the necessary labour".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“A asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in an individual social group or political opinion,” said Sessions on 11 June in its publication of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Pallu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are under way to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother as she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in Palo, a broken city.
“The paramedics carry bodies all the time.
Clean water is running low."
It seemed to be urbanized, returning to the destroyed homes that were breaking through the wetlands and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, rested outside a military hospital in Paluy, where patients were treated in the open because of constant severe earthquake suns.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was living with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get rid of them.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the walls," Harris told Associated Press. He added that he and his family were in town because of the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador accuses China of “abuse” with “propaganda ads”
One week after the publication of a four-page ad by the official Chinese newspaper in the U.S. daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China, Beijing, accused the abuse of the American press of spreading propaganda.
On the last Sunday, US President Donald Trump mentioned the paid allowance of Officer China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the November 6th Congressional elections, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials accused Trump of trying to interfere with the U.S. federal elections described Beijing as a new phase in Washington's ever-increasing efforts to push China.
Although it is customary for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange blows by introducing customs duties on imported products.
Chinese refund tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in federal countries, such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, were said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to the Chinese and former longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, “now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press”.
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese Government used the cherished American tradition of free speech and free printing to publish a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the newspapers in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens about the worrying Chinese economic path, since the news is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several sexual assault charges, will be known in the upcoming mid-term elections with the loss of voters.
The feelings here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm down angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this either tomorrow or November,” said Karina Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, on Friday, following a report by Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang “November Coming!” when they demonstrated in the Senate Hall, when Republicans who oversee the Justice Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported the news portal Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all limits,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst.
"People say they're strong already, and that's what they're holding.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undeclared voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but do not often vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault by a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a major mix-up for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just the vote of the world or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s arrest; it’s also about how Republicans deal with it and how they dealt with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities Group, who supports the Democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between this or more to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more support from the latter.
A new survey by YouG shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say that they believe Kavanaugh for sure or most.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably lying during his witnessing, and only 30 percent of them said that about Ford.
Following the pressure of FBA, FBA is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified, under oath, that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, was guilty of assault.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world web, opens a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt was intended to "rule the world".
“We decided to do this now”, he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create a “personal data storage storage” or a sub-data storage facility
This may include contact details, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls this “personal data empowerment”.
Executive Director John Bruce says the idea of the company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask for permission."
On Saturday's release on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the aim of Inrupt is to "provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Festival of the Carrier of Victoria’s Cross from World War I
For 100 years they have been celebrating the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the Church of England who gained it as a fighter in World War I.
On September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was honoured.
Four days later, however, he was shot by a sniper, and he never found out that he had been granted this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel's grandkids discovered a memorial stone.
One of the great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic,” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act with which he earned his medal.
According to a report by Officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quintin's Canal on 29 September 1918 "through a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he set off against the line of fire and led the line forward with the “greatest heroism” and then attacked the machine gun himself and struck three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 2018 – only a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they also laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give.”
The fans of mixed martial arts have been staring all night to watch Bellator 206.
Imagine: All night long you have been looking to watch the completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 duels, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get along, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed to learn that the transmission had been replaced by the play of the Pig Pep cartoon.
A lot of people weren't really excited, because he stayed up until morning just because of the fight.
On Twitter, one of the fans described the switching to a children's cartoon as a "sick joke".
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s programme,” said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Puzza Pepa. Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule by including viewers in the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think I could arrange it,” said Coker.
“But then there’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged at the switch, and not everyone was nice.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed it was just a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five battles — as usual. We have tried to offer more than our expectations and have included ourselves.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “less valuable” in terms of sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that his sexual orientation made him feel less valuable than anyone else — but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that "not everyone" as himself was aware when he entered high school.
In his first talk on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said that he had talked about gay rights to give others “hope. ”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
The regular host of a longtime show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a multi-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outlaw in the first edition of Laverne, said that he felt “less valuable” than everyone else, since “it was not socially acceptable to have boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day these feelings of inferiority and diversity are a real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something”, he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic contestant became an influential advocate of LGBT rights and this year appeared twice on the Games of the Communities of Nations in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that his romance with a man — the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “has surprised him. ”
Daley married an Oscar winner over 20 years of age last year, but he says that the difference in years never meant a problem.
“When you experience so many young people” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic games and three years later his father died – he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his "whole view".
“If I were asked last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to reach the gold medal’,” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "You won't be in the first place this time, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving at the Olympic games in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of songs — the stream of music by Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparing for the Olympic Games and where his skin still cools.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson's Saturday's Ryder Cup is over.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to get back in shape so that it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the bienal event on record 12 times, left Captain Furyk to sit on Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly in improving his game in order to correct what he struggles with.
In view of the fact that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the most directly, the 48-year-old does not best match the narrow Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missed blows.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari in Sunday's 9th game, and he'll be connecting with the new Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have four fewer games at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals were to start well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he put up with me on my back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of trust in himself.
He's one of the celebrities, and he's in the past, and he's also been a tremendous contributor to the teams this week.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we thought it was necessary to do so.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup Cup Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence on the team also brings some untouchable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make a fool of people and it’s wonderful to have him in the team space,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they got together with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be overturned
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of individual games in Ryder's Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
In 1997 the young Danec was elected at the Valderrama game, where the site, the captain of which was Seva Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and through the goal he only got through with a hair advantage, with a result of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (in picture) following a tour of the Class of 2018 team that won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told the Le Golf National team 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the cup isn't over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game's not over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He says all the time that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Admiring the game of his players on a challenging field, Bjorn added: “I would never rush here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
The game of individuals will be at the forefront tomorrow, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, your golfing skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you have to convey to the players: Tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnover in the last day, because in Brooklyn he was part of the winning team before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every last word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as quickly as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gets sustained, it exerts a lot of pressure on mid-games.
We created the right setup and put the boys in a way that we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to fight the battle and fighting Rory McIllroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, while the other Europeans will be in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys I decided on this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” said Bjorn about the choice of individuals.
New German Warship Postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put to use in 2014 in order to replace the ageing warships from the Cold War, but due to the failure of systems and the rapidly increasing costs, local communications reported by at least the following year.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ships of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should be joined by the Navy in 2014, but an ambitious project is plagued by worrying issues after delivery.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing class of the Bremen class frigate.
They are expected to have a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance distances – the latest frigates may remain outside the home port for up to two years.
However, continuous delays mean that the top warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas with their power, will become obsolete by the time of application, says Officer Die Ziet.
Last year, an unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages when a German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are only known, and German news reports have cited a number of key “programme and technical shortcomings” that would render the warship useless if it were sent to a combat mission.
The weaknesses of software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce in the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibilities of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” ship was to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the missing equipment, the cost of the entire project – including training of the crew – has become a problem.
It is expected to reach €3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from the start of €2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was in fact "missing ships suitable for deployment".
The official said that the issue had grown over time because the old ships had been decommissioned and the replacement vessels had not been provided.
He regretted that no ship from Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new survey is being carried out on the property in the Scottish Heights, trying to find out how bats use food when hunting food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats, as well as brown bat earrings and peripheral bats on the Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
The key sites of the estate will be equipped with special cameras to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kinds of things they do.
They will then draw up a Habitat Card and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and the loss of habitat.
Risks include wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies and some types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
The nighttime hunting habits, however, help each other to hunt prey more with their ears than with their eyes.
To accurately determine errors and obstacles on the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspections of shelters and occasional rescue.
The organization has established even the first and so far the only Scottish reserve on the property of Three in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, specifically for bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says that the property for them is an ideal territory.
“There is an excellent area for bats on Threeave,” he said.
»We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitat.
But there is still much known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to do.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as the possible accidental destruction of one bat maternity can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young babies, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so they are forbidden to kill, harass, or disturb, and it is also forbidden to destroy their birthplaces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply do not know how well their populations are holding onto them.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers prepare for a German magazine lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges he was about to commit as “false news” and said that people wanted to “promise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine with news from Der Spiegel, who has released the charges.
An attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 for his silence on the event.
In addressing 142 million followers in Instagram Live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “false news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," the camera was told by a five-time winner of the Golden Ball.
“By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone good," the actor smiled.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing, according to Reuters, for the Der Spiegel magazine's lawsuit for charges, which have been referred to as "unacceptable reporting of suspicions of private life".
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "real estate damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at Mayorg's nightclub with Ronald, she was to be raped there.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her that he was “99% a good man” who disappointed only “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photos of her injuries at the hospital, and later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "awesomely afraid of revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because she continues to have severe trauma due to the alleged event.
In the summer, Ronaldo moved to the Italian giant Juventus at the time of the alleged attack just prior to his transgression from Real Madrid to Manchester United.
Brexit: United Kingdom “would regret forever” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would regret it forever if it lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer following the Brextine, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK for the BBC had said that UK’s exit from the EU would temporarily stop production in a plant in Burnaston, near Derby without an agreement.
“We need a deal”, said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of brexitis without an agreement could lead to job losses.
Burnaston – manufactured by Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that in the event that Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Concerns about how the exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade without agreement have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW stated that it would close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexitis.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the principle of “at the right time”, with parts of suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU arriving for cars on order every 37 minutes.
Should the United Kingdom withdraw from the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could lead to distortions at the borders that industry representatives say could cause congestion and a lack of parts.
Toyota in its Derbyshire factory could not store for more than one day parts, said company representatives, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely moderate to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” said the BBC Radio 4.
“Data not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would have been stopped, but in the long run it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and finally lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years in the Burnaston factory and is the founder of the union of the Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job will never return.”
The government representative said: "We must present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, says the White House.
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “replaced for one more week”, the White House said on Sunday, due to the ongoing battle over the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian pre-election interference, the links between Trump's colleagues and Russia, and the potential President's obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Attorney General's envoy and thus threaten Mueller's independence has been fueling Washington's rumours for months.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretap to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On the last Monday, he visited the White House in the middle of reporting that he was planning to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was announced at the United Nations conference in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would “not want to forgive” and then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judicial Board hearing, which was witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for it is not yet set. It could happen this week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, we could postpone it for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure that you are informed.”
Some rapporteurs would object, and Sanders has not convened a White House meeting with the press since September 10th.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of meetings could not be attributed to the "setting up" of TV reporters, but she said: "I could not deny that they were set."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without mentioning the source: “We have looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still be held," Sanders said. "But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is endlessly better than discussing it with me.
We are trying to do this as much as possible and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guest statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why when he appeared freely and in part bizarrely in front of the assembled journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to NHS Scotland on concerns related to brexitis
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working on the Scottish NHS that he would express the country's gratitude and desire to continue the work after the brexity.
Jeanne Freeman, SME, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, as the decision was drawn closer this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie emergency surgery after head injury
The lineup supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation following a head injury in Saturday's defeat at 31:27 p.m. against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ of The Tennesseean.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred only a short time ago.
"He got to the edge of the field and he kind of collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied oxygen to Abercrombie at the edge of the playground before they laid him on the stretcher and took him off the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the details of the type/ extent of the injury are not yet known” and that the University of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the University of Illinois.
On Saturday he had five strokes together before he left the game, which his total number of blows in the season rose to 18 strokes.
A higher fee will be charged to foreign buyers when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
A higher fee will be charged to foreign buyers when they purchase property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased quantity will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects her to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
A higher level of quantity will be charged to foreign buyers when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will be for the homeless, and Theresa May will report today.
The move must be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and to increase the taxation of high-income people.
The increased quantity will be charged to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage the Government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The premium — which will be charged in addition to the current quantity, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and properties for surrender — could be no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-nationals of the United Kingdom will buy 13 percent of the newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and more difficult purchases of first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number of young people to buy their first home.
The large construction companies accused the price rises by grabbing land that they did not actually use, and Mrs Mayevo urged him to leave the quotas for affordable housing in order to repair the British "residential shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rents and the completion of forced evictions without error.
He also wants to give city councils more authority to build new homes.
Ms Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would devote my primary leadership to the renewal of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our non-functional housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create a life.
It cannot be right, however, that for persons who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, buying a home is as simple as it is for garage British citizens.
For too many people the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the Scotland Club"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is once to become Scotland Club Manager.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first ranking.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St. Mirren took him back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportssound show.
“But I grew up watching Scotland often as a child in Hampton, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if you were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic team chief, who had previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town, says that as heir to such great names, he did not feel fear.
“Success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’.”
According to the structure and capacity this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he said.
“The way there is not easy, but I would probably consider myself successful only if the club could take it again.”
Ross only worked as a manager for three years after he was an assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months as a part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league from dropping out, and St. Mirren led from the edge of the exit to the title of the championship championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real turning point," alloe recalled.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as an actor, and I had a relatively good time with it, and I also achieved some greater success.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a lot of things to deal with every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to run a club and I'm doing it now. In my entire adult life, I feel most comfortable now.”

Research result: ideal time for beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the income of the hard - breaking British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chain has also increased.
In July, pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who prepared the data, said: “A persistent solar weather and England’s participation in the global cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as last June, when pub income increased by 2.8%, only that restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The drop in traffic in restaurants increased by 1.8% in June.
Traffic in pubs and liquor bars increased more than in restaurants compared to each other.
Due to solar weather, sales also decreased in pubs offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant operators.
Seems like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sale of food decreased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality of RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The biggest factors of weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain in the sale on the catering market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8% will be particularly painful at the annual level due to constant cost pressures.
For owners of restaurants with food, the long hot summer could not come at a more wrong time and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring about the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of brands.

One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on the social network that he hides from parents and teachers
A survey among 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has fueled fears of sex-related content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “head” account for their parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account on social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has fueled fears of sex - related content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they manage a censored “main” account that they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
The mother, who happened to run into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter had been asked by visitors to rape her.
The survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which recognise that they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers succumb to temptation and create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the “vote of athletes” on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the field and outdoors and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We are convinced that athletics in Scotland, with its inclusion in the committee, would gain immensely,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I will really be able to contribute and help with sports in Scotland."
An American who has won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC commentator has lost his ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I was fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I exercise for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!«
An ad for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has distributed online opinions
The company that manufactures the pump has divided its opinions by an ad comparing mothers to cows in molasses.
For the start of the marketing of the "first silent portable pump", the consumer technique company Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in barns filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I am drawing, and there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my boobs.”
The congregation continues: “Exhaust, burn out, feed babies, burn out, burn out, squeeze breasts.”
However, an ad that was published on Facebook’s website caused considerable disapproval on the Internet.
At 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said they were joking at the expense of the “gross” dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also get pregnant and cattle to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in the first days after the anchoring," one wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "Ad completely unfeeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she considered the song “to die funny”.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it, too, if I were still breast-feeding.
When I was drawing, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it, just like it was meant to be.
This is a brilliant product," wrote another.
Someone commented: “This is a ridiculous ad that targets mothers who drain their milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw on their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even outdoor activities while drawing milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, further commented. “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By moving the parallel between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on drawing on milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way that women can connect with, to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump came to the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the model trail walked for designer Marta Jakubowski when she was using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen significantly, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to hand the child over to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid that they would threaten their own chances of staying in the country with a request for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand over fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Agency for Immigration and Customs, testified before the convention that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80% of those who are either sponsors or domestic sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard, said asylum workers.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not in person, to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the greater the likelihood of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to the statements of the workers in the detention centres and reports that have been made in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where signs of child’s distress due to their size are more likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to a tent city without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to celebrate by friends could complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish “occupied forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though war had been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would "conform with them".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the Assembly.
Moualem said that the “war against terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave home, “almost finished”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United Nations has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were suitable for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of spreading “incomprehensible fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“The international community and humanitarian organisations have been called upon to contribute to their easier return”, he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including those from the Fronte Nusra associated with Al-Qaida, who would “be eradicated”.
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and push the way to elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to the “examination of the articles of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach his second term
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the 2020 re-elections unless, as many liberal viewers hope, his presidency ends prematurely with interpolation and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency at any time!"
So far, there's no sign of the tiredness of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN ratings have doubled to 1.05 million during the largest viewing period and the ratings of MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of its peak, reaching the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the MSNBC channel.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designed Survival”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, acknowledged author of the book "Only Funny Parts: and some hard truths about snooping at the Club of Hollywood Boys," offers a different explanation.
Remember driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” she told me.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what seems to be on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe case against Wade, given whether immigrant families can reunite with the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, a six-hour look at the round table of experts discussing the use of the source “from a deep background” for Bob Woodward’s book “Fear”, $15,000 worth of jackets from ostrich leather (“Footwear, fat-substantiated”, said The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trumpova, km, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'm never gonna look at Super Maria the same way again.
“The part of his work that impresses the reality of the show is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about Trump’s show’s acquisition and daily spin-offs script (dating with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai at 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was pushed inside watching MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
There was no way he could tear himself apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember that at the time we created all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows in preparation for the narrowest mid-term parliamentary elections
Not surprisingly, in the 17th Pennsylvania district, two candidates were in the race for the same seat because of the remodeling of congressional districts.
This recently divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is the home of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The maps were re-painted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally drawn for the benefit of the Republicans.
The match in the new 17th district touched on the fight to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March Special Elections for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the U.S., they thought about sanctions against Salvador for China's support, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Panamanian Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to recall the American leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama are proud of “the recent decisions to end the recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were being considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to receive US$ 140 million in aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the limitation of financial assistance and the targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would have severely affected this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, the highest government officials had explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding their thoughts on the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference participants, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the US government attaches to the meeting, was added to the diplomat.
Three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss them under the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government and also spoke about it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also supposed to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the congress changes hands, Mr Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues at the moment he prepares to speak again to his constituents.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to argue that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed in missing the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
At such milestones, the flow of history changes and accelerates or inhibits the relentless march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with multiple such milestones right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this officer reported that he proposed a covert recording of the president last year and speculated on his inadequacy for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
“How will we react if the requested investigation of the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or if he is appointed as the Supreme Judge despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a congress that will require Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, we will have a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will place them in a convincing position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the player Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this as a starting point for greater achievement.
“This was a well-deserved point for us, since Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point away.
Perhaps we could win in the end, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am with the crowd behind us convinced that we can try and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including the injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying themselves; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor sleep of women for fear of savings
Although pollers had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talk to their family members about this.
Half of the respondents to the Nationalwide Insurance Survey said that they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said that they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but do not try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide Insurance.
You can start the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not discuss this with her in time .
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term insurance financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a healthcare provider to determine the trust of a person who will supervise your health care and ensure that your health wishes are respected if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the authorisation of a person for his or her finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information into the action plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” asked Martin.

The shooter, in the '40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 2.30 p.m. after British time, as a “random act”.
He didn't see his attacker's victims.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called potential witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase.
At the end of the communication, rescue workers from the regent of Donggal, a region north of Paluy, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and a tsunami struck it.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
Regency, the administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have had 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi region are aquaculture and farming, in particular in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, mining of nickel is also an important activity, mostly in Moravali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo, after reporting to the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Natural Disasters, have repeatedly affected tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected northern Donggala and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an earthquake - active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are occurring here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A larger earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh at northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and caused 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: The type of severe earthquakes affected West Sumatra late in March and early in April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake affected the southernmost part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: The 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis up to 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and causing the death of about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake affected the regentry of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunami didn't start, but the collapse of the buildings caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
A 29-year-old from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstruction of family violence and resisting arrest, police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, took the phone out of hand.
Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Predictance Institution and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, reported the KTOU TV network.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pronounced himself “certainly innocent” when asked about the defence, the network reported.
Palina was charged with three Class A violations, which means that he could be imprisoned for up to one year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2000.
The arson of a crime is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of alcoholized weapons in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups when she linked her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
The social media has videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
When he hit the beach with a tsunami, there were hundreds of people at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sifulla Saipov, a terrorist attack suspect in New York City where eight people have died, and it's a rare crime in the country that hasn't been committed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rental delivery truck to carry out an attack on a cycling route along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injuries, as recorded in the notification of the death penalty application lodged in the South District of New York.
According to a court record, any of the charges may be punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, the major federal jury of Saip informed the defendant of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in support of blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and slander”, said prosecutors who described Saip's way as “stupid, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccoa” is recorded in a notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District District Court handed down the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was handed down in New York City in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS video he saw on the phone to perform the attack.
The police also said that he demanded the dispossessment of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering related to these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand a death sentence.
For negotiations on brexity, Nigel Farage, a Tory Member, said, should be in charge of the negotiations on brexite.
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the human army".
The former leader of Ukipa said that politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members, Theresa May, suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
On a march in Birmingham, conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if Mr Farage, the secretary for the Brexite, had been.
But the challenge facing Mrs. Mayeva in coordinating her deep-separated species was further highlighted by the Tory, the favored failures of the brectite who joined the separate protest against the brectite in the city.
The Prime Minister strives to keep his plan on track during the attacks by brexite, brexite and EU opponents.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between their package and the "cocas".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Going means leaving) in Solihulu to "want to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as an interlocutor and give him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
This MEP from Wellingborough added: "I will support the brexity, but we must get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU as follows: "We did not fight in world wars to be servants now.
In our own country we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
The meeting was also attended by the Tory brexist Andrea Jenkyns, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Ministerial President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan in the general public is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active in the streets and lead us to elections at all.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs Mayeva, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given “feel the heat” if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to deliver the peaches and today we are gathered together to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do this’.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of issuing brexite, to feel the heat.”
"We mobilize the people's army of this country, which has given us the victory of the brectite, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a double meeting in the city center.
This weekend, a handful of activists waved the flags of the Tory against the Brexite after the group was established.
The Labour Noble Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for their security problems when using the client app after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for an agreement Canada plus, for a border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is no such thing as a good brexity," he added.
Warren's bid for the presidency will be "exactly examined"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "participation in the presidential race will be carefully studied" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation in order to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to bid for the presidency.
Warren said it's time to "go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrested after the death of LSU Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU Wayd Sims' basketball player.
The police station in Baton Roug reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, 247sports reported.
Wade intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the incident, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion, and the team orders him to let Sebastian Wettle win.
On Saturday it became the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it is clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race”.
Bottas had already begun well at the start and almost left Hamilton dry when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the first one to the boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes later led him into the boxing and left him behind Vettlom, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that Ferrari's driver was reluctant to leave the inner side open and risked that after two defensive moves in the third corner he would fall behind.
Max Verstappen began with the last type of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
Then most of the race was without changing tires, as he intended to perform a fast finish, beat Kimi Raikkonen and occupy the fourth city.
He finally went into boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he couldn't increase speed, so Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Valtteri drove fantasticly all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done a truly remarkable job in order to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad physical talk.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at the Saturday meeting for her insistence that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate investigative commission, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate was “evil, corrupt and false”.
“The only beautiful thing that can happen in the Senate has happened in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at publications and revelations, people say ‘No, I didn’t do it’.”
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you expose this?
Remember her answer ... you exposed the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
Okay, hold on a second.
We have revealed it ... No, we have not,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was exposed in early September — but Feinstein denied coming from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter,” according to Officer The Hill Feinstein’s report to the commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked."
Her denial, however, obviously did not correspond to the president who said at the Saturday night meeting: “I tell you, this was a really bad talk of the body.
Maybe not, but it was the worst rumor of the body I've ever seen."
In defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of improper sexual behaviour, the president suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to hit to get to power and control," the president said after reporting on the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants with a win at the Sunday game in Dundee at 5:3.
The Giants scored two goals early on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied up for the home page, and then Dwyer regained his advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard leveled the Dundees before two of Lundvald Nielsen's goals gave them a victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat the Dundees 2-1 on Friday night from the background.
This was the fourth season meeting between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 at Kendall McFaulla's assistant, and Beauvilleier, who scored four minutes later, was given by David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan reintroduced the home page at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowan to the equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' leadership on vacation when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The home page was gathered again, and Bouchard made up for the backlog with a violent goal at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran unitedly helped Nielsen put Dundees first at the end of the second third and took care of winning the fifth goal of his team half-time and took care of winning the fifth goal of his team in half the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller with his death allowed hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are celebrated as a hero after sacrificing their lives so that a plane with hundreds of people can take off safely.
On Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by severe earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although the workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a highly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Yufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it so that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was coming down.
He died later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian BBC News Media House.
We've prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“The heart breaks when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency for Disaster Reduction in the country has said that access to cities in Dongala, Sigi and Boutonga is limited.
“The number of dead is expected to increase as there were numerous bodies under the rubble, but many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings bodies.
There's no clean water.
Minimarkets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Pal and said to the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" According to CNN report.
In early this year, earthquakes in Lombok affected Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
The crash of a microwave aircraft: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing from the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that managed the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says they miss one man after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a publication Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline was told that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing.
They did not respond immediately to a call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said they took seven people to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday who were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just ahead of the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
“This is extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that, along with other passengers, he managed to get through to the belt, reaching the emergency exits of the diving aircraft.
He said that the stewardess had triggered panic and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy also said that sailors who were near to repairing the pier were able to help themselves with the rescue by using an inflatable boat that led people to land before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 shoes) deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last two decades of aviation accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his phone records to determine the movement of a 29-year-old defendant named Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he had received the location information from several cell phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, which contradicts his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he "was lying because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second discrepancy was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers when she died about two weeks ago.
The cell phone footage shows that you only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” said Hale.
The defence is due to present final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury was scheduled to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hiphop has drifted away from the original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the United Kingdom with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
The New York nanny sues a couple for firing her for a "racist" message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatingly dismissing her after receiving the wrong message from the mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
A couple deny racist conduct and the lawsuit compares it to "rape".
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at the arrival of the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEEEE ONE MORE BLACK” was written in a message to her husband by Mrs Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding her failure, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “inconvenient”, fired Mrs Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire the Filipino, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then they sent her home with Uber.
Maurice now seeks compensation from the couple in court, amounting to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was initially hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things are not done,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after regret.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
Not racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband said about the Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
In comparison to the lawsuit with “emigration”, Plasco said that his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation”.
“Will you put up with someone like this?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings before the court are still under way, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned couples on social networks for their behaviour and way of thinking.
The publishers of the Paddington bear story feared that readers would not connect to the talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success.”
She said that her father, who at first worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, was bitter when his work was rejected, she added that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book “Granco-sweet”.
With regard to Paddington's bear, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was these people who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But since Paddington’s bear was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You’re proud of him, even though you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success was always attributed to Paddington the bear himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
At the time of the landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors sought to preserve her life in vain.
“She regularly called on us to say that she felt really bad that she did not expect this to happen,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received Nadia’s call. He told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by her doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly took and left her system.
She'd been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit around and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position where my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to endure."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who were unaware of the test she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had a bowed head and tears were running through my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving female glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to deter others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Vale Bridge glue posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he got depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a relative when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies for many years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the floor. When the children opened the gift, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they must process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI investigation into the air
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked – after a limited investigation period and scope, this might unify us,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was falling apart because of the tightening of the party stall.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on November 6th, there will be only five more weeks - if the Republicans are expected to cut off badly, this will weaken them very much in an attempt to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly telephoned the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and presented him to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI agency prepares the report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Mike Pence, vice-president, a breakthrough from the position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean MP.
According to Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, 1,127 people fled last year, compared to 2706 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and an increase in the price demanded by human smugglers.
Pyongjang has not yet made a public comment on this.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarised area between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South — which are technically still at war — have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on late negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho has attributed US sanctions to a standstill since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” said Mr. Ri in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh "histically" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives named Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate "histically" and said that he was inherently unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
She said that in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman, if she behaved like that, would be referred to as a ‘hysterical’,” Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony before the Senate’s inquiry committee commented on Pelosie.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the charges of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming, and he choked on his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the charges against himself “grotesque and coordinated mud”, organised by the liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost her in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed as a supreme judge, as it showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with these statements and the way Clinton and the Democrats went,” she said.
Pelosio's question is whether Kavanaugh will try to file a constitutional indictment if it is confirmed and the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
“I will say this – if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which it is now” said Pelosie.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosie said that she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Law on access to health care or the Roe v Wade case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say ‘Isn’t this wonderful?” said Pelosievo.
And a woman's got to be flaunted.
This is a righteous outburst, after months and years of pouring anger, and cannot express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs Stein told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem rare to me, do you think?"
She continued: “I was helped very much by a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, namely, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may seem sad to you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are partly allowed as a way out for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable rage, was an event where an elderly woman — a cold leader who was always a little afraid of me, dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They will think you are sad, and they will be happy to finish you off."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat named Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply depressed that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
“This was not a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the game, and another one was needed.
Someone then named the game “Snowflake and seven sticks”.
As the latter joined the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she wondered.
When she reported that she was not going to launch an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her — were so dissatisfied with the system that she was so hard to raise money and turned on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — were so overwhelming that she began to choke.
“We would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs Schroeder recalled media reactions.
“We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How the War Between the United States and China Can Benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle was not over long ago, experts say that the division between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, triggered the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively means taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been compensated each time with equivalent compensatory measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent for American goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving the US eye by the eye and will probably not blink soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China would have to agree to its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would have been too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing could make the right move, the US's long-term trade-war pressures could have a positive impact on China in order to reduce the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security’s Brain Trust.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated in more than seven years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all conditions are met for refugees to voluntarily return to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins Ryder's Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris in France won Ryder's Cup for 2018.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder's Cup since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
At 16 holes in a pair-3 game, American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty through most of the championships, hit the water in his initial hit, and had to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the rounds and became one of the four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the present form in 1979 achieved a result of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth beat the lowest European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a tough year this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the Cup again.
It is a team and I am really glad that I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He's handing over the relay to his cousin John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” Rachm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France he played, and now he has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3 Cup.
It's an unusual statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 big titles right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked hard all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all along the championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
We pushed Europe a little bit this morning.
We missed it.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to regroup, I'm gonna work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
The hat's down.
We've been overtaken."
