Members of the Wells Assembly worry that they “look like Muppets ”
Some of the Assembly members are dismayed by the proposal that their title be changed to "CHR" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum worry that this may be a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists said that his group was concerned that the new title was “roaring with Tup and Deep. ”
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Playd party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party pointed out that his group "is not prejudiced" towards changing the name, but notes that the new name PMP (in English – MWP) has a certain verbal similarity with "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in the same way as the English Yorkshire word U.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting the draft bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision for all the descriptive names with which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling it the Parliament of Wales.
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Parliament of Wells, in short, 'PPP', but the option 'PDO' has received the greatest support since the inquiry into society.
Members of the Assembly are offering alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft amendment bill within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach a discussion of the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum whether to change country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, said he would not begin the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin silently amid the difficulties of churches in Harlem
"If we look from the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today they're both gone."
Adams says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialise in different ways," he added.
"Bars are no longer the quarterly everyday where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not reach for as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would be in the same situation".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who do not help survive the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the new settlers will attend them."
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem became a quarter of the black people – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and the St. Martin for a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was established in the years after 1930.
Then the building became owned by the black people of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage to the fire, but Father Johnson's parishes drew up a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu of Michigan University, also noted that this is the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather mentions that St. Martin never replaced him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few weeks was a complex story made by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
From the newspaper, which is the governing body of the pastorate, consisting of the world’s leaders, they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the costs of the newspaper” even though it did not have a role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old child was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representatives said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beakon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about half an hour a Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and entered with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized how he was yelling, “He bit me!
You bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he found out that the whole area of his keyhole was torn apart.
"I asked everyone to come out of the water because there is a shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, gave a media briefing that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the water, but it was not considered dangerous.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the coastline of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans to campaign on the British beauty market
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening booths for decorative products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK's beauty market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase, while sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest beauty stands so far will be located in 11 shops across the country, after which, with success of the initiative, they will be found in more sites.
The investment turn in the decorative industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stacks, recently occupied by TV sets, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of ornamental products offered to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space like the offers in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also replays its boutique gamma makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food every day at convenient times leads to the need for supermarkets to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, the CEO of Sainsbury, has said that the facilities will look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain tries to beat Aldi and Lidl's computers, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have Argos sites in hundreds of stores, and also open the Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased food sales and has made profits even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to redesign its beauty and pharmaceutical facilities was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's supermarket sites.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with the 281 site of Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We transformed the type and nature of our decorative stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands proposed by us is intended to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant setting, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for decorative products, which challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "feeling angry" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-pound deal
Dragons Dan Peter Jones's star "he's pissed off" after TV host Holly Willi gave up a 11 million-pound deal with his livestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby doesn't have time for the brand household appliances and Truly accessories.
The couple's business is compared to Guinette Poltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her departure to Instagram.
Holly Wilby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to boil" after withdrawing from their lucrative business with the brand Lifestyle products in the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "fed off" when the "Golden Girl" on TV admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that there would no longer be time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop of Guinette Poltrow, with rumours that he doubled Wilby's fortune, whose value is projected at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: "Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be its long-term commitment to ensure its future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the welds is entirely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters that's full of waiters for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading "This morning", which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in placing the brand on the market.
And not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, the mother of three, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wilby herself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined the company as chairman in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV company.
Wilby will become the "messenger" of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann McParlin as the lead of the "I am a celebrity" broadcast on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business dealings. ”
Heavy negotiations leading to “integrating relations”
He jokes about the criticisms he would take from the news channels about making comments that someone would consider "unsuitable to the President" and being too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his humorous "newly" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea "does not see a reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards its first steps along the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – the cessation of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of US soldiers' bodies.
He also defended his neo-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were said not to need them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that there is no need for international assistance, which makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is forming a team to go to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not often found on the rest of the coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu has probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more difficult.
Until recently, a hospital ship stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches its destination.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's backward infrastructure into the centre of his election campaign, investing large amounts of funds in roads and railways.
But his lack of funding is constantly harassing his office as Joko returns to the urns next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Look, Daniel Stridge brought a late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea.
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to the High League against Chelsea naked in 89 minutes this Saturday at Stanford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was 1-0 behind him.
He set the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the criminal field and headed for the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the Plural Kepa Arizabalaga and intertwined herself unsavoryly into the network.
"I tried to take a good position in mastering the ball because players like Shak are always looking for front positions, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible for a good shot to the door," Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the target Cante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after goal on her Belgian star, Eden Azar.
The attacker of the "blues" handed his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then snorted from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged a quick double feed in the center.
Then he released a fast-shooting belt that led Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot at the far corner of Liverpool's doorman, Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is increasing to 832
The number of deaths since the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is increasing to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of the buildings, collapsed after the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, the reporter of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported at the news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, is surrounded by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been started since the body of a woman was discovered in Birkenhead this morning.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabbing of Grayson Mose on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was allegedly arrested.
Police are asking for help from anyone in the area who's seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I implore everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the cameras on their board, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in a private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman their acquaintance, arrived at the scene and inquired where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues as police report that they're informing the victim's relatives right now.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Muse tried to get home to his apartment, but he was notified by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he found out about what happened.
Residents have been informed that they will be allowed to return for hours.
One of the police officers informed a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman crying.
She keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the border while another van stayed outside.
Police officers are stationed in the cordon, watching the housing block.
All available information shall be requested to contact @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "writing history"
Its ban will be a poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr Creek's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate that Oliver Cromwell’s statues be removed from the Palace of Westminster.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The grand presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to defend parliament against external pressure, of course in his case this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly identifiable person, which represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored."
A murderous pig hurts a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near the Leupanshui market in Guizhou Province, reported on Sunday's South China Morning Post.
The pigwood was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines in Sinin, China, on 30 May 2005.
He and his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan are expected to arrive on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also closed the door to a nearby joint open.
He also reported that there was a big male piggy with a bloody stare in the joint.
Forensic forensics confirmed that 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's stepfather's stepfather was bled and disfigured," said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that the family of Juan and the market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although they are rare, pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was critically injured.
Ten years before that 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to chase him out.
After the Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can help them as a “slip. ”
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and torrential rains in the southwestern part of the United States
According to weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. in the morning east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
During this time, the Pacific Ocean begins to form a synclinal that moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical moisture deep north to the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
In the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching Sinclair will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carry debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
Lightning floods may occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a paw in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and storms.
The approaching Sinclair will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach rainfall from over half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
Sunday has a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States, it is expected to have a warm start in October, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east to the prevailing temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the exciting spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s of the 20th century.
During this time, political opposition continued, with networks disrupting their regular turnout programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement agreed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was convinced 100% that Kavanaugh was pushing her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has not happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's 20.4 million viewers reported watching the testimony on Friday.
The company counted average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate data available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch from their jobs.
In comparison, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of this championship football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican came out of the office with a declaration that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday as protestors cheered him as he tried to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already issued a declaration and, before closing the doors of the elevator, said he would speak further during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided live coverage hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate's attention.
Ala Flake said he would only do that if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which the opposition Democrats insist on.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" with Brixit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political play" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Ladies' Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs fees from Britain to the EU and vice versa is "absolutely absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting of Wade Simms, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, the police department in Baton Rouge reported.
Officials presented a video of a confrontation between Simms and Simpson, telling police that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS WAFB's branch office.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police reported that he confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
East Baton Rouge's Forensics Office published a preliminary report Friday that indicated a gunshot wound to the head and neck as a cause of death.
The authorities are thanking the Department for the search for refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents for the assistance provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Sports Director Joe Aleva thanks local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The tall 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
In the middle of the last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets a game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, reported that the team was "down" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “it’s something that worries a person all the time. ”
A volcano scatters ashes over Mexico City
The popocatepetal ash emitted from the volcano reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and in the last 24 hours 183 gas and ash emissions were registered.
The center has observed numerous earthquakes and tremors.
Photos published on social media show a thin layer of dust covering the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since the earthquake with magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence met with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote to break Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began measuring the guardians of peace with eggs and paint powder, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually swarm with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other fights with the police, police resorting to their batons to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while those who declared themselves to preserve the country's integrity responded with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the region's desired independence even a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalunists.
The vast majority voted in favour of independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The wanted independent groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hopes for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best times.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we are in a jam," the man added.
Despite the important victory noted, it was a small difference in the regional elections in the last December, the political parties supporting the independence of Catalonia are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or are arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded his phone protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more and more intense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repressions we see on the part of the Spanish government".
Londoners: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men of age, 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after a car crashed several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings has announced that there have been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has won.
The freshman in Livingston High League surprised Rangers and only caused Steven Gerard's second loss in his first 18 matches as the manager of the Club of Aybrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team lined up with the second in the Hibernian ranking.
Gerard's team remains undefeated on foreign ground in the High League this season, and next Sunday it faces the leader Harts, who is left with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosting a rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is already in a six-game series without losing the championship, and Manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed a good opportunity against the hopeless guests.
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored the goal, and his direct style of the game made it extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow went sideways, and then Alan Lithgow shot him by the beam after Craig Halkett put the ball back with his head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests from static positions.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingstone played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining and taking Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
By that time, Rangers had more control over the ball, but they were facing the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and doorman Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This style of game continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Ranger's doorman saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and a blow to Littlelow's head passed the door after another static situation for Livingstone.
In Livingstone's criminal field, however, the centred were rolling, but they were easily cleaned, and the judge on two occasions failed to respect the guests' claims for the duzapa – first after the competition between Halkett and Glen Middleton's reserve, and then in doubt about the game with his hand.
“Fenmental” by Livingstone – analysis
Aladair Lamont of BBC Scotland on " Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomenal game and a great score for Livingstone.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to overcome expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition hardly changed after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes in the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under constant pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed no inspiration.
Under the guidance of Gerard, they're demonstrating some great things, but in this case, they were way below those standards.
They missed the last pass before naked, only once they managed to break the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
Friendship is cooling because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters who wanted to see their president were still hanging around.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
Various protests reflect a breakdown caused by a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and is also despised as a despot of others.
Road crash in Deptford: Wheeler rests after a car crash
A biker died after a car crash in London.
The disaster took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the driver died instantly.
The crash took place a few months after another rider died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The capital police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man, then informing his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are deflected, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the zone.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Overseers Are Injured in Mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, reports from the Prisons Office.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcester at about 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to control it, special personnel from the Tordano squad have been called, who will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, such as a riot in a limited one - wing prison.
The injured overseers suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Specially trained officers have been called to handle the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we very clearly declare that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and that their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the riot squad were summoned to prison, where they could handle a major riot where the staff was attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be struck by a tropical storm, but there is a high probability that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert of the southwest, leading to a risk of lightning floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with rain coming in late Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service noted on Twitter that “from 1950 until now, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Pool, will likely receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain in individual places possible.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain will probably be useful, as the southwestern part is currently in the dry land.
According to the US Drought Monitoring Commission, slightly over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavyweight category," reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to reaching the land at Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, who can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles an hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north 12 miles an hour.
The storm occurs with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach the land in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of boredom.
"Summer rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, possible up to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, Northwest Sonora and the desert south-west of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summersett.
The wounded boy was discovered in the area of Excelsior Terrace at Midsamer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
On the night of Radstock's arrest, a 17-year-old boy, two boys of 18 and a 20-year-old man, reported from the police in Avan and Summersett.
The cops are asking anyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Cavanaugh "stricken by the bitterness and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the evil and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanaugh was "stricken by the bitterness and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly rejecting Christine Blacy Ford's sexual assault charge decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "Today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation in public service," the president told a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly sees Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the republican vote on the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, I am also a participant," Trump continued.
"For this reason, I am traveling and fighting in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves on a mission "to hinder and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanau's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, as CNN reported to one of the members of the senior representatives of the Republican Party.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast by giant waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in Palou on Friday, when on the evening the coast was swept away by waves up to six feet (18 feet), taking many to their death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami comes after an earthquake with a 7.5 Magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster," BNPB said during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
"The water was pulled with it by cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palou.
Published by the disaster agency, photos of air showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and twisted bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
The second earthquakes continued to sway the coastal city on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the hiroshima nuclear bomb released during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the rabbit.
He also added that "communications are completely suppressed and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, for its part, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can weigh even more."
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticised for not informing Palu Tsunami of the disaster, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the shore and carries both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to authenticate the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power cut, which has stopped communication around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palli on Sunday.
The people who died in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala were able to reach Palu safely, where they found shelter in the tarmac shelters stretched out in their office yard, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, says Mr Doseba.
"They told me they had seen countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite ongoing work on rescue and recovery operations, emergency groups complain that foreign rescuers are being prevented from reaching Palu in such situations.
Under the Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be initiated if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at a regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status."
While Palu falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and families of those still in the dark continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's National Paraplannerism Team, trained two of the missing Asian Paraplanners, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the field of paraplannerism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa-Roa Hotel, he had reached the community of paraplannerism, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only answer to his communications was one such grey.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 during an ATM charge in Levi's Newport.
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was charging an ATM in Levi's Newport, became clear from a police announcement in Newport.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy writes in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “went near behind Brink’s employee’s back ” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but the police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All those with information on the identity of the suspects must contact the NYPD on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes Ye's name
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West”.
West, 41, has been wearing the Ye nickname for some time and has been used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show tells us.
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West had previously claimed that the word had religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio station Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Cania, which means only one person, just to Ye – which reflects the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
The rapper is one of the many known in its sphere that has changed its name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, P. Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the Leo and Brader Lion aliases.
One of West's previous associates, J.Z., also presented himself in a version with or without a dash and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, swore he would never use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolco Plaza President López Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
López Obrador swore an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The US must double the financing of the development of the II
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of developing artificial intelligence, the US has to double its research budget in this area, according to the researcher and developer of the II Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government units made statements on the II topic, although the US generally does not have an official strategy for II.
During this time, China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in the II until 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for the development of II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are about to make further breakthroughs with respect to II," Lee said.
The doubling of funding can also double the chances that the next major achievement in the II area will come from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book The Superstitions of the II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies for the II in China – Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon Lee University, he worked on the I.I. system, which beat the most successful hotel player in America, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee owes his dues to previous federal government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Competition of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify the new visionaries.
"The researchers in the US often have to work hard to earn funding from the government," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders, it's corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaires to work on the II.
Lee also says that changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its II programme.
"I believe that doctors in II sciences should automatically offer green cards," the man said.
The US State Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explains.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic communities, and from the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in the development of the II.
Meanwhile, the legislative body of the United States, which wanted to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not observed any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name constitutes claims against its territorial integrity, which therefore imposes a veto on NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum alone, while the boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum would reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the newsletters is this: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the newly formed Yugoslav state Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding force, enough members of parliament have said that they will comply with the result to the extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the State, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must therefore vote.
The State Election Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, electoral activity was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters visited the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to replace the country's name, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene at 54 years of age and arranged chairs in front of tents, strained by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to Macedonia's needed investments, as unemployment in the country is over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he had cast his own vote.
The State also said that the positive result would lead to "the consolidation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published results of a study, according to which between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a case of Macedonian television Thelma, reported that 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defenses and scores goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and won Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday's Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalie was found with a belt in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenses from Brighton before he shot the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English attacker, with one touch, returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with a right-hand impact, overcame Brighton Matthew Ryan's goalkeeper and found the right-hand corner of his neck.
"Aguero struggles with some injuries in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored naked at the exact moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance to the "heavens" in this match from the British High League.
He signed up in the 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguero got a shot deep in half of Brighton.
He immediately released a passport on the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a belt on the distant beam.
The attacker of the "heavenly" managed to detect close, just before the ball got into the car.
City will face Hoffenheim in a match from the championship league group phase at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a game to determine the fate of the Rockies.
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no particular point for another title-starter game.
And yet always the ambitious Chercer hopes to be the title Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the match is important for the Rockys, who lead with one match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of the NL West.
The Rockies guaranteed at least a "wild card" match after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain they will win their first title in the division.
"Even though we ourselves do not fight for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it is expected that they will allow Schertzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer, it would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he conducted training on Thursday and would have had the normal time to rest until Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikers in 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president pointed out the situation with his electorate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau as he spoke about the importance of the republican vote in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also claim that although I am not a candidate, I am actually also a participant, that is why I fight with all my strength for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he went on with “You all see this terrible, horrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They're determined to regain their power in any way, you're witnessing their mercilessness, their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over, to get into power and governance, because they're only interested in power and governance, but we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves up to "intervention and obstruction".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "angry, ugly, vile and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Fainstein by name, which has caused strong mob outrages.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad gesture – maybe the worst I've ever seen."
The Labours are no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of Parliament so far from the Labours to whom it was said he was not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude, as she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticises me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed his disagreement during the previous leaders' time.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting report said on Friday that “we want meetings to include all and be beneficial. ”
During most of my eight years as a local representative of Labour in Parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "light and moderate" policy have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on the basis of how much it liked the party's leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had worked for before thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole insulting tirade in social networks where it is called for withdrawal, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to Labourists.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In truth, I know that I have even drawn more happiness from some of my colleagues, since my comments are at least mainly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist scheming every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that Labourers should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with every sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming more and more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received many counsels to keep quiet, not to speak so much, and that then “everything will be all right. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labours 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher's government, which through neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a councillor at the local level or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state seeks Brexit, it will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour Manager.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labourists or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political exclusion will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in defending your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Air lead in ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from the Tennet High League.
The team is already in charge of the ranking, and the only team on the ten is without loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Mercy and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," said Mercy.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations for Air really took advantage of their situation better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional strike by Frazier Klimo, led Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released from the Wariers game, allowed Melrose to catch up in the result after Jason Bagot realized an essay followed by a failed additional blow.
Klimo increased the advantage for Er by a criminal blow just before the half-time, noting the essay after the solo action, and then realizing the additional blow, which made the result 17-5 for the Air on vacation.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Baggott, reduced the lead to only five points.
After a long-term cessation of the game due to the severe injury of Ruard Nott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and after the renewal of the Air match, they increased their advance after Stafford McDoual's essay and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then Air Captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and implementing the essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts returned to their presence in the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down the Air Without Ball, from the subsequent criminal play McPherson realized the essay using the advanced offensive line of Air.
Klimo carried out the extra blow, not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the kicked-out ball from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
The star from Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading towards a more direct and warm branch after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the broadcast, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow's “growing restaurant business. ”
"The sea is ours": Bolivia's no exit to the sea hopes that the vessel will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen are constantly patrolling the sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag hovering over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs rightfully to us.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit passed to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – and the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest of decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, after five years of deliberation have already passed.
"The force is in Bolivia, there is wisdom and unity everywhere, with the country expecting a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgement of the international court on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a contested re-election battle next year, also waged a lot and much on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's probability of deciding in favour of Bolivia is quite low, and even if it ruled in favour of it, it wouldn't change things in reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to take over Chile's territory and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after hearing the latest arguments indicates that the case is "not complex", says Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been shattered by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate said.
Then he implied that Morales' military rhetoric had been eliminated and that little remained Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what has happened to have a normal dialogue.
Both countries have not supported diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political crutch".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never embark on nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the US to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting the zero-out diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree to the declaration without Phanyan first making a significant gesture on the road to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phenyan they are serious about giving up their arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest scream in massive hats that will soon be in fashion shops next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which sneered the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
A lot of impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, with designers sending their eye-beating creatures to weaken the fashion community.
Valentino's pop-up proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar feathers wide periphery that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
Other too large accessories included jewelry - decorated dunes, a magic hat, and even pineapple — but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – but just in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had their lips sewn up and reminded not so much of fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs was like diving equipment in a full set of snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a melted funnel of ice cream.
If you're into similar fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The giant hats come very soon after the "La bomb" – the two-footed straw hat that was seen on everyone's heads – from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski..
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that took over the social networks led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearing it with a swim model.
The ruffie bag with the colour of a burnt orange, with the rims of the Rafi and the handle of the white leather, was the attractive all-view item in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacques during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told F EMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for high-gauge accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen careers and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relations and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first of all with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved high A.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of students in German, 69% of students in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
At the moment, languages as subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out in 2014 by the Commission on Employment and Labour Skills of the United Kingdom showed that, for reasons of difficulty in finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Therefore, the use of foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the knowledge of a foreign language, which transforms these skills into essentials in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after having mastered such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a person’s masterful few languages ahead of competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 adult citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose reign reaches a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That is why investment in language learning is now important for children.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare the children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to have an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which must be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will make his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are anxious to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Laker's coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would take part in the first game of the pre-season team against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's going to play in the fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," said Joke Walton through Lakers' official website.
Reporter for Lakers Mike Trudell announced on Tweeter that James is likely to play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers pre-seasonal games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-seasonal games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rally, which includes stops in known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Postponing the confirmation vote for the election to fill the seat at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours, Eastern time tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions arose over allegations of immoral sexual activity, which held the Senate's confirmation vote for up to a week while an investigation is under way by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to its programme that the President will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told Trump's campaign spokesman, who refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wyling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia – a state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind in sociological research.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue, "forsom" matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Coop needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a pretty subjective concept, in which players believe implicitly, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led with six points, and now there are only four, so I suppose we have gained a little momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's racing day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more to be allocated.
As Spite says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
Fans' cheers grew stronger as he progressed into the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas were left behind with two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the match of the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything was lost to the American team.
"It is important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," said Spite.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with multiple points from Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, the undeniable heroes of Ryder Coop so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four, and they seem to be getting it all.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "rich" on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which energy passed between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed the view that they are the players who will win Sunday and there will be no better pair than Flytwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, stories of European glory have proved somewhat premature.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "Fourball" games since morning while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "devils" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and Swede into troubles they failed to cope with.
In the Sunday games, however, there is no way for anyone else to solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Foursom" games are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
Europeans played better on the team and therefore gained a significant lead the last day, but this session of "forsom" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something in which many people, especially in the US, strongly doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Coop, after taking the US 10-6 after playing the games from the "fourball" and "foursom" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their assets at the Le Golf National race increased to four points.
In an attempt to recover the trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the morning's "fourball" games over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 series.
The US has more resistance in the "forsom" games, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from the 12 singles game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is Europe's first recruit, he won four points in a row, and he and the Molliwood Molinari, known for their nickname, became only the second couple after this sensational weekend, won four points from their first four matches in Ryder Coop's history.
After unappealingly overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in the "fourball" games, they were extremely motivated to defeat the broken Woods and US recruit Bryson Decambo with an even more categorical result of 5&4.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated sparks of his genius, but until now there are 19 losses of 29 games in "fourball" and "forsom" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, on vacation for tomorrow's "fourball" games, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "forsom" clashes in the 2–1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas gave back the Americans' hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2§1 victory against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" games, and later came back to defeat Polter and Rory Makilroy with 4&3 in the "forsom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Coop has the team been able to catch up on four points before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will keep the trophy even in equality.
However, since they were outplayed in two consecutive days, it seems their chances of turning on Sundays are not particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that the continuing sanctions deepened confidence in the US and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Young-how said that in the last year, "significant measures of goodwill" had been taken, for example, we stopped nuclear and missile testing, the destruction of the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Despite that, we do not see an appropriate reaction from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances can we first disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stepped" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea will be rewarded, as it has taken step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, as it has not rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phenyan has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is striving for an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the US says that Phoenian must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls to ease strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists "that we remove nuclear weapons first" and increase the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting is planned between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In in the last five months and added: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the US, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a halt.
However, Ri's tone was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN general meeting that the targeting of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after "evil president" Trump called Kim a "man-rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at UN Trump, which threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no time for this and said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding the nuclear programme and the Phanyan ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ree at the UN's general meeting and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenyan in July saying he had made progress, but only after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster requests".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the US takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the “measures in question” he sought were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a sufficient rest course
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to overcome the growing culture of learning “all night” with caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world often don't even think about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, has prepared a course that he thinks is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this right now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of the dream which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of the routine of sleeping.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is a growing problem.
The provision of sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as the deprivation of sleep puts the brain into a hunger mode that makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all graduate students will be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competition institution.
Professor Keissler recommends that students consider whether to set up an alarm for bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of the blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal crashed Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's hopeless team and won 1-0 for Livingstone.
The Aybrox team wanted to record its first victory as a guest in a triumph in February with 4-1 above St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only applied Gerard's second defeat in his 18th match as a manager, which left his team eight points less than Harts' torn-off team, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the team of Rangers, deprived of constructive ideas, at no time seemed close to levelling.
After the Rangers match, they took off in sixth place, and Livingstone's already third, leaving the second Hibernian only by the head.
For Rangers, there may also be additional problems, as Foreign Judge Callum Spence was hit on the head after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that smashed Air into the finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11-year-old Livingstone who scored a point against Harts last week, and he should be happy with the way his aggressive team mated all the actions of his opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did better in rare cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to notice in the second minute that Menga brought out a touch of Scott Pittman against doorman Alan McGregor, but the half-defendant missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' focus on foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow pushed the ball away from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a gap in the 15th minute he met Stephen Lolles, but the referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's claims.
Rangers made only two exact shots in the first half of the day, but the ex-doorman of the Aybrox Liam Kelly handled the blow with Lasana Kulibali's head and the weak shot of these Ejarias.
Although Livi's 34-minute hit was surprising with regard to the ball's ownership, it was totally deserved.
Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep center again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the impact.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play a game style convenient for the hosts, with Lithgow and Halket constantly pushing forward long balls.
Holt's team could've increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGregger managed to deal with Jacobs' impact, and at the next corner, Lithgow fired headlong past the beam.
Entered as the Glen Middleton reserve from Rangers asked for a push at the end of the fight after a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson saw nothing wrong with the situation again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day of the birth of future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger is developing a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually leads to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
A tiny stone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture, when the 1950 film "Coronado Bells" was released, in which the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms emitted from radiation in minerals."
Evans: “He certainly cares right now! ”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.

A new anticancer vaccine can train the immune system to see and kill foreign cells
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are injected back into the patient
The vaccine showed promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine who trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then inject them again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Institute of Oncology of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their “training” how to target cancer cells has been used to treat the type of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title "Let's Make America Great Again", with his participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was stared at the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a senseless performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "Let's Make America Great Again", he announced against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“ I often talk to white people and they ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he’s a racist? ’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's performance was uploaded to the social media by a comedian named Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
And West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was trampled behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat. ”
They stopped me!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the sinking ship?” claiming that it will wear Superman’s costume because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
Comments caused at least twice the audience's insults and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said: "The whole studio has shut up."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
The West puzzles many with the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perier".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “On one of the bravest: Thank you for meeting the crowd.”
The lead on the show, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West was just "being himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") whom I think welcomes and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, and now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following Didi's example, also known as Puff Grandfather, Puffey and P. Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dog, his name was Snoop Lyon, and Prince's musical legend changed his name to a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, they say from the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of "Game a Thrones" Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for the role of the waving sword John Snow in a violent medieval fantasy series of NGO "Game of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, spoke against the macho character's stereotyping, saying that displaying such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they must be "sharp" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from "Game of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that he feels "solidly convinced" that this problem must be solved.
"At the moment I am personally firmly convinced – what did we do wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach older men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to a lot of male characters.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is taught?
What's taught on television and on the street that makes guys feel like they have to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or continuation of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the show next summer, claiming that he "was done with the battlefields and horses".
From November Keith will play a part in the reconstruction of Sam Shepherd's "True West", a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that he thus gave me my future family and determined my life in advance," he said.
Rose is playing Igrit, the girl in which Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with a fantasy show, the Emmy Award winner.
The two married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV is thus reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the community of LGBT in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking senators' data from the Republican party, slanders "the dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the Chamber of US Representatives Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three US senators from Republicans on the legislators' pages in Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites on the "ultra right wing".
" Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate staff on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Maintenance websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and leaked information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This groundless claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including former White House White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that it does not have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a pushover.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics that he also seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"Absolutely, if true," he wrote.
Waters said in his statement that her office was looking at the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Jonny English magazine explodes again – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-participated film and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English Returns".
Will self-smile and the mimics, who say how obvious it is that we are stupid, become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes peeled and the "gum" person has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is most important when it comes to a great comical creation designed for fans of cinemas who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering glamour, owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and much of the man who contributed with a single note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the chaotic traveler and international man who Atkinson played in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads.
In the last Johnny English movie, there are either two good times.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, carrying a medieval armor and short-circuited feathers in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely lacking, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "The mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems more focused on children than on adults, and Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, as the lack of Actinson's game reminds Mr. Bean.
The usual assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked into the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operatives for the horror of the undercover agent – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister who is puffed up and overpowered the figure and already suffers from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-theresa-May role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that she must call in a retired agent, as all active agents have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center, but who is illegally teaching lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English is creating a spy rock academy.
English has been summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo's already a family man married to a submarine commander, a jolly role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odyssey of farces: dressed as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak up on the luxury yacht of Walt; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of Walt's house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, there is a lot more content for children here.
It's a pretty mediocre product.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labour deny they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan, according to which the British work four weeks but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants the company's bosses to provide the economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to the workers, giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same payment.
Sources say the idea would "safe" the economic programme and party plans to shake the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
Labour spokeswoman said, "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy not being considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "personal directors" and "speculants" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour Government could impose ‘maintenances’ on the basis of the violations found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of net capital to private employees who can raise annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking about 60 minutes ago whether the investigation of Cavanaugh by the FBI can change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could force some of the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican party senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more exposed than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after the statement came out, and asked him, “Did you do it? ”
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and in order to change it, it is necessary to shake up the charges," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it emphatically," Graham added, turning to Christine Blassey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen festival and does it even help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty worldwide.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great sea in Central Park, who will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendez's performances, but will also become acquainted with the real purpose of the event – the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” as voluntary participation, sending no e-mail to a world leader, calling or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to demand action or is it just another case of so-called "klivtivism" – people think they are doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from supporters who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds already have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the "Food Force", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, the commitment to "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a mere historical note," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman to the live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken that called on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government had announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which would reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CHVs on his website asking, "Why do you think we can stop extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But as with the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy Bee, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, at which Deborah-Ley Fernnes and Hugh Jackman will lead.
The US can use naval forces to "block" and prevent energy exports by the Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinc, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinc claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink referred to the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is presented as "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel," he said, while defining Russia as a "one-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration has the task of increasing the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which Trump says is turning Berlin "a hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the 11 billion dollar pipeline of the North Stream 2 that will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres is a pure economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the presidential run in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "look seriously" at running for president after the interim elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take the presidential nomination seriously."
Warren expressed his appreciation for President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for High Court Brett Cavanaugh.
On Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological survey Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's bid, 38 per cent against and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed on potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Byden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD at Trak Palin's rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are coming home with," she told the audience at a rally about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning slightly changed, entrenched, returning and wondering if they will get the respect that they themselves and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of immobility, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Vassila police department.
18 states and district of Colombia support dispute new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum for victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the county applied for goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed against federal policy in August, has not been revealed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his gang members" harassed her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's been detained in Texas.
US lawyers helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which come a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing comprehensive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy brought back the decision of the 2014 Board of Appeal of immigrants, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such a prohibition violates this principle," the goodwill report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that policies that refuse entry of immigrants harm the American economy, pointing out that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"A haven is granted to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs," Sessions said in a July 11th message on politics.
The asylum has never been meant to alleviate all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while deaths double during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting more and more difficult.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded possessions.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a spine and shoulder fracture, were located outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly for continuing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the ruined wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Blams China for "Breaking" with "Advertising Propaganda"
One week after an official newspaper in China launched a four-page advertisement in the US daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa State – after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th election.
Trump's indictment that Pecky is trying to interfere with the US Congress elections noted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they level the tariffs on imports between countries.
Experts from the US and China said at the beginning of the trade war customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's republican party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and Iowa's former long-standing governor, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the weekly number of Des Moines Register, "is currently doubling this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government takes advantage of America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press, by putting on paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, on the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have with regard to China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the offer to publish” his article, although it does not specify who.
With Kavanaugh's pogrom, Republicans reject women's voters for mid-term elections, warn analysts
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend the nominated Bret Kavanaugh Supreme Court on several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the ceiling are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be brought back," Grant Raher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "Novembers Come!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue the Cavanaugh nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, a partyless political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that a reaction may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench. It is about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps elect democracies.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided about who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, slightly more inclined to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of those who respond believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that Cavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her in a state of immobility when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her follow-up to Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee is launching an venture aimed at rivaling Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds an open source platform for Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We should do it now," he said in terms of the undertaking.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "on-line storage of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time is all of them.
The unique thing about online data storage is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "the granting of personal data authority."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is that the company invests resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who entered into a project contract, and a group of programmer volunteers.
From this week, global technology developers can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are being completely updated overnight.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in the Medium on Saturday Burners-Li wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Li transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months Burners-Ley has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt has started, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest honored with the cross of Victoria during World War I
They are celebrated for 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest named Victoria for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he was honoured with Britain's highest military honors.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by two of his grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to have the monument discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's medal case.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under heavy artillery and machine guns. ”
Later, he attacked the line of fire and with "amazing courage" led the building forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set a wreath after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Van said it is "a great honour for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been waiting all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six of the main map and had to be broadcast live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in Britain were stunned when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were building up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan description of the Twitter switching of the child animation film as a "sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme was replaced by a child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President for marketing and communication of Bellator, in response to a question about broadcasting.
Peppa pig, yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they'd be working on planning meetings to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings on Sunday and there is no way we can plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to fans, but we overreacted.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "they're not all like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in the hospital for a few months.
While participating in Laverne Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the feeling of worthlessness and the fact that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope ” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprised him."
Daley married Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he took part for the first time in the Olympic Games at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such rises and falls."
The two became parents in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says that "his whole view" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I only care about winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized to his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told him that his father couldn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there for me, Dad, or the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I had dreamed of this – jumping at the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more wonderful feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him tremble.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Mikkelson's lost form remains on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Coop, but he'll have to get his old form back if he doesn't want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in a two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for "fourball" and "foursom" on Saturday.
Instead of being the main figure in the US team again, the five-time winner of the big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most regular players, is not in the best form for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong shot.
And if the course itself is not disturbing enough, on Sunday's ninth match Mikkelson will face the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who is on the team with rookie Tommy Flytwood and strive to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12 single games make a strong start, it might prove that the Mikkelson game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is convinced of himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much in both the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected it to play more, but it just worked out that way, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in Ryder Coop, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in Ryder Coop, which never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 loses and seven equals, but Furik said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be melted
Europe’s team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before single matches on Ryder Coop’s last day can easily be erased.
The Danish debuted in the Valderrama game in 1997, when the team with Captain Seva Ballisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but right on the final line he was almost caught and barely managed to hold the victory by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead on Valderrama; we also had a big lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama we won, but very hard," Bjorn said, after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So history has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final result of the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the presentation of players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow will come the individual performances and this is different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you go out alone, then you put all your capacity under test as a golfer.
This is the message you have to get to the players: tomorrow you have to do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, because he also has to give himself to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to present themselves better individually than as partners, as exceptions are only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great reverses on the last day – he was part of the Brooklyn triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed "The Miracle of Mednah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on "Brookline", as well as on "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under tremendous stress.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Jan Polter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this row because I think it gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said of his single choice.
Germany again postpones the launch of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the ageing warships since the Cold War, but this would not take place at least until next year due to the malfunctioning systems and the enormously rising costs reported by local media.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand of new frigates from Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by the army spokesman.
The shipping court was to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuertemberg class, commissioned by the fleet in 2007, will replace the aged frigates from the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship rockets, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates must be able to use up to two years before returning to the ports of home.
However, continuous delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will already be old when they enter the operation, Die Zeit notes.
The evil frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet is returning the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of significant “software and hardware defects” that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, as the vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older frigates from the Bremen class.
In addition, it turns out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the newest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is in fact "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem has become larger in time, as old ships have been taken out of operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of Bats
A new survey carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the Scottish National Trust will follow the commonly-known bats, as well as the brown arrowheads water nightgowns in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations in the estate to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the bats’ call sounds, as well as the species that issue them.
A map of the habitat and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, Nature Conservation Adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat zones are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In general, bat populations in Scotland and Britain have decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to loss of habitats.
The risk of populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular research, inspections of asylum and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threeave estate in the Dumfries and Galois region, home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson estate says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Three, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a complete suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He stressed that it was important to verify the presence of bats before the maintenance activities were carried out, as it was possible for involuntary destruction of one asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelter.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker at the Bat Protection Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, since we just don’t know what is happening to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German press journal Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Instagram video, addressing its 142 million followers, several hours after the publication of the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo branded the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the camera's five-time Golden Ball bearer said.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that call “unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage in a manner consistent with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in the case he simply gave in to "one percentage".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that's what happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "scarred of revenge" and worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain “will regret forever” that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in the production of cars after Braxit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of delaying the border in the case of Braxit without a deal could lead to job losses.
In the plant in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150,000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMWs, for example, say they'll close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Braxit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the case of Braxit without a transaction.
Toyota's production line works on the principle of "timely", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers, both from Britain and the EU, for cars manufactured on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which according to industry can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible for them to wait more than a day to complete their inventory at the Darbisher plant, said the company, and so the production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's "chasmat" plan for a future relationship with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in the programme 4's Today on BBC Radio.
"After claims not only to Toyota but also to other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term it warns that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsovaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has been the founder of the Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I feel that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
The government spokeswoman said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House says.
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week", as the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh continues to fight, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general, or not, and thus threatens Mueller's independence, has been feeding the rumours of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "precise not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “It may not be a date yet, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court may be a delay for next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10th.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked for the reason.
Sanders said that rare press conferences are not because they are hostile to the "demonstrative behaviour" of television journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have a demonstration behavior."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and it will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking persons.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and momentary strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
The Health Minister addressed EU workers to the National Health Service of Scotland regarding concerns related to Brexit
The Health Minister addressed EU staff working at the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the state's gratitude and desire to remain in their seats after Braxit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
I would therefore like to remind you how much I value the contribution of every single employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after receiving head trauma during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Senior coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fainted there," Reid said.
Coaches and medics supplied Abercrombie's oxygen to the sideline before it was placed on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blockades before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blockades for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher wholesale tax when purchasing real estate in Britain
According to the new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher wholesale tax when purchasing real estate in Britain, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms tax in the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, and additional revenue will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current wholesale tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of granting – may amount to up to three per cent.
The state Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “monster cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy only appears a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting the land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to repair "the shame with UK housing".
Mr Corbin announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the end of "no blame" expulsions.
He also wishes to give the council greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation would be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the hardworking residents of Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the resentment of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’s team”
Sandersland manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge of reinvigorating the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in the First League, at three points in the first place.
He passed the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Miren back to the Scottish High League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was it," Ross told Scottish BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up with the games of Scotland at Hampton, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"But this opportunity would only open if I had success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moys, Sam Allerdaise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poiet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former mentor said he was not concerned about the legacy of such established names in a similar famous club, before which he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I bring this club back to the High League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly on the level of the Supreme League," he said.
"It will not be easy to return to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after he spent some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' training headquarters.
Then he helped Alois not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miren into a winning team in the Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folkark, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at the crossroads," he remembers about the time he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best place for me, including before I was an active player.
Sounds strange because I did well, made good money, and had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin all my conscious life."
You can hear the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at the frequencies of Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British summer time
The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals the study
Summer heat increased the income of the surviving British pubs, but increased the tension for the chain restaurants.
The pub and bar groups reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the business consulting CGA, who composed the statistics, said: “Because of the prolonged solar time and continued longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July a similar model is followed, as in June, when the pubs reported growth by 2.8%, but the restaurants received an even stronger impact.
The decline of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and liquor bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The pubs with food also suffered from the sun's weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while in food there was a 3 per cent decrease."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw in late April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic services sector.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although the decline in sales by 4.8% on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food managers, and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret profile from their parents in a social network
One in five children – some only on 11 – has a secret profile in the social network, which hides from its parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News raises fears that sexual material is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "core" profile showing their parents
One of the five children – some of the 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps the adult secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexual material is being published.
Twenty per cent of the students said they have a clean "core" profile showing their parents, while they also have secret profiles.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Alyde Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" on the Board of Mild Athletics in Scotland
Alyd Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as Director without performing the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished lightweight, and President Ian Beatty has identified this move as a great opportunity for those who lead in sports to take advantage of its rich experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Ailid is delighted to have great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," Behti said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes, and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the finals at 200 and 400 meters of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, added to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a temporary ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I got hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I've achieved a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, separates online opinions
The company producing breast-feeding pumps has divided online opinions with advertising, which compares nursing mothers with nursing cows.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected “first noiseless breast-feeding pump in the world suitable for wearing”, the consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music-video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to the breast-feeding to express.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack, against the background of a song with a text, including: “Yes, I breast-feed, but you don’t see any tails” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wiener, it’s my breasts.”
The song continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, milk your friends. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying that it degrades the “treasures” of the dairy industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump is collected discreetly in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is perfectly understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a nursing pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: “Such inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement by admitting that the song is “extremely amusing. ”
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Drowning made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertisement directed at mothers who are drowsy (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This is not advertising, praiseworthy or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on seeing that many women who are breast-feeding feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while they squeeze out.
Ana Ballarin, partner and Executive Creative Director in Mother, commented: “Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch of the market.
With the drawing of a parallel between breast-feeding and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on suckling and all the challenges associated with this, while at the same time showing in a funny and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom, which will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets in the lead news.
During the Fashion Week in London a mother of two appeared on the stage for designer Marta Yakoubovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, partly because acute rhetoric and policies by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to stay with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear that they risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other family adults should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either guardians or family members of the guardians are illegally resident in the country, with most of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to hunt these people," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely it is to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter employees and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving the children to “the palace city ” without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends can weigh down the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has continued for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "to which the relevant actions will be taken".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" both by terrorist organisations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The US has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian troops, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions are tolerable and can return, accusing "some Western countries of "inflating groundless fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue something that is a purely humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for Syria's recovery until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to halt the war is reached.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major fortress of Idlib rebels provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related "Al-Nusra" front, which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump would win a second term
By this logic Trump will win the election re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue on the part of the viewers.
Since 2014, the premium rating has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the primetime, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where he talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is a veteran screenwriter of comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why? ”
Mrs. Skovel told me he said, "Because she makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that's shown on TV, emerging from Washington's stories can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether the immigrant families can come together again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this at six o'clock to watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source of his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s pilot jacket of 15 thousand dollars’ worth of skin (“puffing with arrogance” according to the Washington Post”), and Stormy Daniels’ shocking descriptions of Mr Trump’s anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does to make you feel like a part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, with regard to changing participants and daily turns (crowding with the National Football League, praising Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Flies this week, he had a sunny, 80 degrees on the north coast of Kawai, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to stand before the Senate's legal committee and that was what the Supreme Court's future depended on.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleise told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments in the most disputed race in Congress's early election
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the reordering of the districts of Congress and from there two titles for the same place.
The newly redistributed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs points out conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th Pennsylvania County, who is significantly represented by the new 17th.
The maps were re-painted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position has been taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because "the recent decisions should no longer be recognised by Taiwan," Heather Naurt, a Department spokesman, said earlier this month.
But only sanctions were envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million of US aid for the fight against drugs, for development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the state of Central America with its unemployment and the murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a gathering last year, viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management authorities specified that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in the conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US MPs quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the discussion details described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is now a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Mueller is directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack against our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will prove that Mr Trump will have to report to that body when he prepares to stand before the voters, as well as possibly to the jury, composed by his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these elections that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, as long as the West stood up and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such knots moments, and the relentless march of democracy slows down or slows down.
At the moment, the Americans are facing a number of such knots.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly to record the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the history in the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And most of all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy awaits it for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Brookings Institute, is president of the “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington”, and is the author of “The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.”
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the conflict with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G Group to the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow half-deficit Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the equal of 2-2 with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a trampoline to greater achievement.
"We won an important point because Villareals are a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We entered the game with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but in general equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night from our European matches.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened next to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope we can do our best to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not declare your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family discuss where and how you want to get care, since these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Appoint a health care officer so that you have a certain trustee who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial commissioner.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing to be prepared.
"It is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid organisations cannot obtain information from Regent Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach edge on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The administrative region, which is smaller than the province, has an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The production of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been high on several occasions since the tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian post-disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami reached the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is on the seismic “Pacific Fire Ring” and is regularly mutilated by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra activates a wave of tsunamis that has swept 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 Magnitude Rabbit destroyed the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, by triggering a tsunami that crashed in the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 strikes near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 mutilated one of the islands of Mentaway and activated a 10-metre wave of tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There are no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people were killed by demolished buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have mutilated the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people have died, most of them from the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's biggest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Palin, the biggest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the pre-detainment building Mat-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “innocent, certainly, ” when he was asked to plead, reports the media.
Payne is threatened with three Class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of his liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are being brought against Payne.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Court of Justice of veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of arms under the influence of sedatives in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a fist in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died from an earthquake that wiped out the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications network has been cut off, with the number of dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social networks are spinning videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave swept the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Cifulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist assassination suspect in New York City, in which eight people died -- a rare sentence that hasn't been executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov is said to have used a truck at the age of 30 to rent Home Depot to carry out the assassination in October of the Veloley near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, gazing pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent in connection with the death penalty application filed in the South Region, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extended federal court sent a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of racketeering-related murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of the IPU.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberateness", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out as "terrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused trauma, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevez, An-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the announcement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last Southern District of New York is looking for a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy and espionage sentence for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no sense of remorse in the days and months following the assassination, according to the court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecutor said.
He also requested that the IDIL flag be placed in his hospital room, the police told him.
He pleads innocent on the indictment, consisting of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a conviction for guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand a death sentence.
A member of parliament from conservatives says that Nigel Faraj should lead the talks on Brixit
Nigel Farague refused to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a protest at the conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" – one of the members of Theresa May's own party suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a conservative deputy, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have been out by now" if Mr Faraz was the secretary for the Brexit issues.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to agree with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supporters of Braxit, supporting the EU's stay.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that the Eurosceptics and Labourists choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon told protestors with the slogan "Exclusion means going out" in Solihel that he wanted to "refuse Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraz had to participate on an equal footing with the others and that he had to be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers plan. ”
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rabbinic.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bon rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The understanding that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is entirely false.”
The conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, saying to reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us get elected.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open letter to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers retain their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farague said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"This is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which helped us win at Braxit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists raised flags labeled “Conservators Against Brexit” after the group started this weekend.
Liberist Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for the security issues of the party when he found himself at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and the whole technology of Canada and more, and more, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexite," he added.
Warren said he would "think seriously" his candidacy for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced he would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe said a representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dile, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She is at the centre of speculation that she can take Trump's post in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor's building after Trump took office.
One of the attendings asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it's high time "women went to Washington and fixed our damaged government, and that includes women at the top".
Arrested for the death of Simms from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Simms of LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without a hitch and detained in the arrest of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A youth of 6′6′′ grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 matches with 10 matches last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Prix to Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after instructions from his team helped him defeat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Waltery Botas ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the guidance from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously disturbed Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the exit of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after the Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat it after a bold maneuver and drive a "tire to the tire", which forced Ferrari's pilot reluctantly to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed the path of his opponent with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
On top of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back lines of the starting grid and was seven after the end of the first tour.
Then he even led through a rather long period of competition, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimmy Rykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered the pit stop in the 44th tour, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight tours and eventually Rajkonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Waltery did a great job the whole weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Fainstein at the rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, accusing the plaintiff of the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally talks in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statements given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how the situation in the Senate shows that people are "evil and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen is the good that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't distributed," he added, imitating the senator.
Fainstein sent a letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh in July, and it was distributed earlier in September – but Fainstein denies that distribution happened from her office.
"I did not cover Ford's claims, I did not spread her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep my privacy and I kept my privacy as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's challenger, charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the disgrace, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get their power and control back," the president said, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants · Global Voices
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants versus Dundee.
Dundee Stars paid back for Friday's loss at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took two goals early after they hit Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled up for the hosts before Duyre regained the leverage of the Giants.
Francois Bushar leveled for Dundee, before both of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goal was confirmed by their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Keefe who got out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between the opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
The blow that Dwyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m. with Kendall McFowl's assistant, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to level with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyre made sure that the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring the second goal at the end of the night at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran united efforts to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second half, as he did his best to solidify the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four games of a total of five meetings, met as hosts of Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
The flight manager died to make sure that hundreds of people on board could escape an earthquake
The flight manager in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane of hundreds of passengers aboard managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many were unknown in a massive earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary earthquakes continued to hit the area and many were caught trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly shaken control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufry Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Sirajt, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We expect the number of deaths to increase, as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings more bodies every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was mutilated by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that a person is in the dark after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reports that a man was reported missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that they cannot contact a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. naval forces said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was past the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane was coming in very low.
"This is extremely nice," says Janes.
Jane tells us that he and the others managed to run through the deep water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head trauma.
U.S. naval forces say that sailors repairing a port nearby have also helped with the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sinks into the deep about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have been killed in flights with planes registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exhibits the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office finished its case presentation this Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he received data on the location of several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sandford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellys died, he deleted text messages, calls, and her contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defence is planned to start with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple after firing a racist message
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving an erroneous message from the mother, who complains that she is “a different black woman. ”
The couple deny being racist, as they resemble a demand for "extortion".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was ridiculed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Mrs Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day then sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the amount of $350 a day for a six-month contract that was originally hired, even though she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this," she told the Post Friday, adding "You are sure this is discrimination".
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable act because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Disguising the claim of "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion quickly condemns the couple in social networks, denying them their conduct and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success, it's so much fun."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book for a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "With Mixed Feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very humble man and was not self-grateful," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child who's achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your job.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After her arrival, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Over kept calling to say that the situation is really bad that she does not expect to survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"After that, Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say good-bye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given by her doctors to maintain her heart slowly cease to function and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I had to just sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to tighten up."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who still mourns her daughter's loss, boards the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"Nobody understood," she said.
"I put my head on, and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of complicity with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women place cards to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day, ” she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They always said his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he left, and he was in “a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: “I keep worrying that this will have consequences. ”
Ms. Davis creates the cards “to let people know that there is someone to go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't keep your mouth shut – you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her companion in her life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor anything.”
She said that it was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “This opens a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans on 116,123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an email to jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans here.
Brett Cavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI launches its investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation of limited duration and limited scope – maybe we could unify our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "disintegrating" despite the established superparty blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their desire is for the moment itself.
The early elections are only in five weeks, on 6 November – if the Republicans are not expected to be well represented, their attempts to elect their representative to the highest court in the state will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called the senators, urging them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has prepared its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea is “decreasing” at Kim
South Korean legislator claims the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen-un came into power seven years ago.
Bieong Sug Park, citing data from the South Korean UN ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared in 2011 with 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's no official comment from Phenyan.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and are easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of both sides met in Phenyan for talks focused on a standstill in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen-un in Singapore, where they agreed generally to work for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused the US of lack of progress since.
"In the absence of confidence in the US, we will not be confident of our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "sister" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "strange" and said he was too unstable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way I could have thought that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her " hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed the allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks Cavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost shouted and felt as he discussed his family and his student years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack against the individual", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and with the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked whether he would try to discredit Kavanaugh, if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not only responsible for entering the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Cavanaugh's potential decisions with regard to the Available Health Care Act or the Roe v Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Cavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it wonderful", Pelosi finished.
And women need to be able to control themselves.
It's a valid criticism, months and years from now, a burst of rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got great help from a woman who was the executive director somewhere, who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her interviewer, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought that was genius."
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of the clearest memories of my previous job, in the office mostly with men, is how once, while I was snorting from the inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the door – a frozen leader, from whom I was always a little afraid – and she dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy to do it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one to appear.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it is involved late in the campaign, it is lagging behind to raise funds and decides that it will not remain in the race if it fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, which states that she will not continue the official campaign, she is overwhelmed by so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and to turn to voters, not to delegates, and anger against sexism, that she felt.
"Man may think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, while the battle is yet gaining momentum, a gap between the two countries will bring benefits to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning valve this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation of tension appeared this week with new duties affecting production for $200 billion (150 billion British pounds) with effective tax taxation on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing returned with a cross-border new bribe with five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has refused to respond to any U.S. attack and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to bring her head down in public before Washington will be too embarrassing for her own Jinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political solution in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before," said Abigail Grace, a science associate on issues related to Asia at the Centre for New American Security expert group.
Syria "ready" for refugee returns, foreign minister said
Syria has announced it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and has been asking for assistance in the reconstruction of the war-era country for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem pointed out that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance from the countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup for 2018, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the US has six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the US.
The US star Phil Mikkelson, who appeared weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with "pair" 3) into the water, which lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari presented himself well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0 since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost 5&4 of the player in the European team, lowest in the ranking – Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter in England, for which this is probably the last part of Ryder Coop.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in Ryder Coop, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing his assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In everything the team is most important and I am happy to be able to help," the excited Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He's handing over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his total balance of Ryder Cup is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 great titles – an indicator that only gives up on Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been having difficulties all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik shared after the disappointing presentation of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players made a very good appearance.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Ryder Cup Committee and look forward.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
New for the Red tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manutti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Animals has shown in principle a decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for shortening growth in the districts of Pinelas, Manoti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - this shows a decrease in concentrations.
The water sections with an excessive bloom of the red tide extend approximately 130 miles along the coast, from the northern district of Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
Seaweed sites can be seen 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro, but are less than last week.
Red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
During the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or slightly deeper in the Pinellas County, low to high concentrations along the coast of Hillsboro County, high concentration assumptions in Manutti County, high concentration assumptions in the coast or inland in Sarasota County, moderate concentration assumptions in Charlotte County, high concentration assumptions in the coast or inland in Lee County, as well as low concentrations in Collier County.
