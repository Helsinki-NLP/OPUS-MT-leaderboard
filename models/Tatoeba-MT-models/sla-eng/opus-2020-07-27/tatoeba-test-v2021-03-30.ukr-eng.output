Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
No one could help me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
Pocket thief pulled Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
This magazine is only worth two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.

I saw Tom crash the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what stepler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I declined this offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I've been watching Tom.
Did you book a table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?

Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a Coke and French fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Is everything okay?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!

He was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.

What are you holding?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how it's done.
Drinking?
Tom's gonna do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting started at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I only went to Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be all right.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We are content with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.

When I walked into the room, she played the piano.
You're very kind.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom was ironing his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party was going?
Mary's high.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying long?

I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom's leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year, millions of people starve to death.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.

I'm exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the devil's literary poetry.

I used to have the same problem.

Your dinner was so good!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot of people.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the balloon is a non-euclonal space, so it does not comply with the rules of euclad geometry.
The talks were successful.
I apologize for that.

He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
I had shoes on.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
Love has a bad taste.
The meeting is over.

Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Get saved!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read that story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a rough night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do this.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We know how to talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't need to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather like?

Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change diapers.

He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When's she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still living next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, excuse me.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.

It was the year of the two thousandths.
Tom will probably take care of it.
It has to be the right color.

You need a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.

I make too many mistakes.
He's not afraid to die.
It would be nice if there were 28 hours in the day, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would not want this catastrophe to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.

Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?

I still do this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.

I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.

I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for her gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He's a robot man, as it were.
Answer the question!
You're needed at the hospital.
I can't find the drawbar.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, it was Grand-Pry.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised Tom wanted to do that.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, we should not do so again.
They've lived there for ten years.

Tom has been blind since birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not gonna work for you.
I can do it for her, as opposed to you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
That's what I was trying to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sleigh.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my little sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was born, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you finish your homework?
Monday is likely to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I disagree with him.
Maybe you should help So paint the fence.
Why do people act like great apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should see a doctor.
I put the papers on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.

Good choice!
Don't you want ice?

What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how it's done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I'm not speaking French to Tom.
An apple from an apple does not fall far.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandma.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
Break it down.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay early.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom is drunk.
Did you agree?
I'm here to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it now.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became a subject of criticism.
That'll be brilliant.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste any time.
Who knows when Tom will?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know many French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Can I have some salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular among both students and teachers.
You can't help with the tears of grief.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go anywhere you want.
We'll see Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are things going?
Then Tom hung up.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do that.
Tom's on the phone for you.
You have to tell Tom to do it.
He's talking to an esperant with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't go through with it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady’s supporter.
I'll take care of it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom move you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved in with Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He's back at the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The language bearers are consciously following the rules of their language without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?

No one's cheering.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I'm shaking Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom voted?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do it.
Tom started the thread.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your holidays?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I still miss home a little bit, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check your voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a cab here?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
It's going to be difficult.
Tom always behaves this way?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk that loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She dumped him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So I felt sorry for Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on rocking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going out tonight.
I told you.
She was headed to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was gonna happen?
What is it?
If natural language can be compared to a time - consuming tree, esperanto can be compared to an artificial plastic tree.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was joking?
So it was terribly boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get the trash out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister is as beautiful as ever.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play outside with his friends.
No matter what happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary got to the bus stop, the last bus left.
Tom's wearing a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
It was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends mocked her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
The aliens are coming and taking our jobs.
Don't worry.
Bell invented a phone in 1876.
Will you take the train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't leave anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
So you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder than it seemed.
I think I've done a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
So that's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not difficult to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'm going to sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's got two cats.
I figured out what my mistake was.
I love going.
The phone's dead.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunscreens.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a Halloween costume?
Tom's busy, and he can't help you right now.
We're not money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to have a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Tom actually thinks someone's listening?
You don't need traitors!
Tom, you could say he's nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I ran into him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's gone crazy.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know what I mean?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Can you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an intolerable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's impeccable.
I'm very interested in studying French.
Be nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I can lend you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your work.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm sloppy.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about in general is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's all right.
I don't sleep well.
Aren't you going to buy it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did?
Did you do it?
I'm having nightmares.
Tom annoys me sometimes.
I'm quite a dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious you're going to have to spend the night with us less.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
There's already a subway in Rio.
Are you ready to help us?

Aren't you staying with us?
It's communism.
In this place, the river suddenly narrows down.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do that.
Tom is a very practical man.
I have a good mother-in-law.
I need a political refuge.
It was quieter after the storm.
There is no easy way to succeed.
Here's the train.
He likes tigers.
It's raining, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Korean.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary are planning to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When have you ever done anything for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
