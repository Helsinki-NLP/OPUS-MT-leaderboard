I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I gave up.
I grow cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like the guilt.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I love to learn French.
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the tipon.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I spit one out.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'll get it.
I said he might turn up.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism — Religion or Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are you caloric potatoes?
I don't see any conspiracies here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Everybody busy?
Everybody happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
I was just resting my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed my room.
Is he cold outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeb really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on his face.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the coon.
I slept on the bus.
I cut off the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is it deep in the lake?
Is it worth the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this right?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this seat taken?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'll starve you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I suspected.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear to God, I wouldn't even make it out with you and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
There can be no coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It's not possible!
It's up to you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; in any case, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it's not helping.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty good point.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think now is the time to leave.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom is petty.
I think Tom's a stickler.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's been tortured.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink the water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what interests me.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've done enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was doing something.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom went well.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to come with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work your ass off.
You didn't want the prize, did you?
I thought you'd found another one.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
So don't you hate him?
We seemed tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So didn't you say you could swim?
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts so bad in here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the toilet lid up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do the job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not that cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come under consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
He's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's acting kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink last night, my head's falling off, and I'm so hungover.
Looks like these two are back together.
These two seem to have settled down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
It's healing me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll turn up tonight.
Maybe it's acting weird.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull it off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get a little rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I went down.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It probably won't be worth waiting for.
It rained two days ago.
He's been doing a lot of hard work.
I tried to explain, but I didn't push.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's getting ready to roll.
It's a classic.
It was such a disaster!
It is advisable to check to see if you can have any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine prescribed for you.
It's a child's play.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to leave soon.
It's so much fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete's not burning.
Quick on foot.
It's simple.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He's been disassembled.
Just make me sick.
It's been raining for a week or so.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
You better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and cheat than to be pessimistic and right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's nobody here.
It's time to close up.
Stay here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them apart.
I guess I misjudged him.
Looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's the way you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's sinking.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get a little late.
It'll happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
It's good training.
It's okay.
It's gotten better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
They shouldn't even last this long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made out of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have much priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
That's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printed error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's hollow.
It's quite common, actually.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out.
He's still on the market.
It's still working.
It's not working yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's weird how people in the tropics eat spiced food like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in place after their choice.
It's really cool.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
You can't handle this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It relaxes a lot.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing nothing.
There's wind.
It's work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned the fan on and I directed it towards the wall.
I turned the lamp on.
I turned off the TV.
I turned down Tom.
It was a great honor that they asked me to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
It was a shame.
It was after midnight.
This has been an arena day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
That was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure spending the night with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It's been a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
Such conduct was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
You've been sleeping all night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas who live on dogs jump higher than those who live on cats.
It was great.
It was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
You've been smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go on a mountain trip.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very stifling in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a shot.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help the lies.
It won't help you.
He's doing a good job.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you right away.
I used to watch you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone's always been there for me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get into one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've been much worse.
I've been betrayed.
I've been briefed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was insolent.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I've been helping.
I gave them help.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been studying French since I was 13 years old.

You can't leave a baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that settle.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You're quickly receiving data.
You're cooking turkey with light bulbs.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could have said no.
You'd make a great mother.
You better ask them first.
That you found them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserved better.
You'd have done the same thing in my place.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You weren't listening.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, right?
You already did.
He did his best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick, aren't you?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be insane to work here.
You know my whore.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be here for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything this way.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not actually big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You guys were right.
Your hair is a fracture.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
Your conscience bites you, doesn't it?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have lovely eyes.
You have many different kinds of people here.
I pay my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
You didn't see it like that, did you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay away from him.
You can't lose your temper.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very pretty lips.
You have very permeable eyes.
You heard the man.
He just came back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Kids, you're here to stay.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You love your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You'll get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be famous once in a while.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get them back.
You're gonna get wrinkled.
You'll try, won't you?
You're going with me!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're going to have to study harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never get you into that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when the time is right.
You looked beautiful.
You look familiar.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look really good.
What's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You made some money.
You've given your word.
You're disturbing me.
You may be needed.
You can go anywhere.
You might have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be too bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
It must have made it so much easier for you.
You must have jumped.
You must be so proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show up first.
You have to forgive me.
You have to help her.
You have to protect the child.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn hard.
You need a friend.

You have to do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
You didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth for every meal.
You need to go to a dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You burn the car.
You burn the car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fed up.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real hater.
You're acting weird.
You're Brooke.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you lied to her.
You really need a shrink.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.

You're impressive.
Now you're in charge.
You're in power.
You're incompetent.
You're influential.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interesting.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're weakening something.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're gorgeous.
You're upsetting Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that horrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have any more alcohol.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a pessimist.
You're poor.
You're predictable.
You're a tight town.
You're perfectly safe.

You're the only one who can make me laugh.
You're the only one who met Tom.

You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're wrong, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
That's a good memory.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is hard.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is pretty much accurate.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is bad.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are quite handsome.
All your stuff is here.
Your desires are my command.
Your patent's off.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to already know the answer.
You look like you're cold.
You seem to have an infection.
Seems like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to say.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
You should be happy for them.

You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very sure.
You cut your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
He used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
They got you drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
We missed you.
It was of great use to us.
You're right from the start.
You've made it white again!
You bought Mary something.
You defeated me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You overdid it!
You have a rash.
You're burdened with anxiety.
You got me all wrong.
I promise you.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me take a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You ruined Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen worse.
You've been putting this off too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
You were lucky to survive the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the painting.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You worry about him too much.
I don't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
