Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in amending the Criminal Procedure Code, has rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would result in the release of a former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the bill to mitigate sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political place in the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Levi’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, there are already losers.
Muammar Qaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists tend to prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has become a follower of the Shariah customary law, which we have heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country because the penalty for stealing is hand-off.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a rival clan society will be joined by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is not the only one of our kind, nor of the best, nor would it be possible for the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters have received help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO attacked, not by the American general, but by God, whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West doesn't count.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of recent unfortunate experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, need not be concerned about the expulsion of “crossmen”.
Although without occupation, would oil companies get Libya's black gold at virtually no cost?
Probably won't, and then the West will finally be able to wail for useless civil rights protection.
Unless the followers of Shariah put an end to this.
A New Crisis Wave Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP data in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, and Germany and France showed growth.
Still, the debt market is record-breaking today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries made their preliminary estimates of economic development available in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, where Germany was better off than expected (a 0.3 per cent increase instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (meaning stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant. According to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than expected by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
On the basis of preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurozone economy and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecast of analysts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is close to a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region deteriorates, the income of the Czech 1-year-old bonds remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech assembly was selected at the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million dollar prize.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Jirachek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was happy to retain a significant advantage after the home match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and produced a detailed report.
Practically nothing remarkable about the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, in part due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the heroic Jiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the entrance to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanović and Vucinic became the most unsuccessful match pair after two excellent opportunities were missed.
The magnificent Peter Czech is one of the reasons why the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
Since the first minute, the game has been very intense.
Both teams had difficulty combining; most of the time they were playing in the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the team of masters in the first time, and further attacks on the defence line have been taken over by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In this way, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, a request for death for both the United States and Israel was made for the prayers of the students before entering the building.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all showed that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
Possible attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran were discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, a request for death for both the United States and Israel was followed by a student prayer before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, an installation in both Isfahan and Nathanz, where uranium enrichment is being carried out.
Dwelling of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than the standard; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and patterns of human behaviour for its or its healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children with obesity ate French potatoes at dinner before an educational interview called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity are not involved in sports, but this concerns the majority of families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents have time for sports at least once a week.
A study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year, with almost 900 elementary school students participating throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not a coincidence for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in the 4-8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sporting burden are the main determining factors in the rapidly growing number of children suffering from either excess weight or obesity.
“For example, only half the respondents said that they eat five times a day on breakfast-break-break-up dinners, which is one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition,” says one study.
No lunch and sausage at dinner.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren are having breakfasts together.
In most families, they all have breakfasts on their own.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family, people don't eat breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis for a proper diet.
The study found that hot foods are more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is more than halved to 15% when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were invited to make their own menus based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Honoring Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 away from the ideal for healthy nutrition.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“A special concern is the high popularity of sweet coolant drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main dish of the pasta, the bird with a small overhang was defeated.
However, children showed little interest in bean, fish, and vegetable dishes.
Pursuing a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits provided they were provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study review group have demonstrated a significant shift in healthy food preferences when they have completed the questionnaire after the lecture Obesity is not a coincidence,” the project concludes.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet coolant drinks, more children began to prefer just water.
In addition, children were more likely to observe birds and fish as the main dish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and baking.
The Stylist must also be a good psychologist, according to professionals
In the first article on training for stylists, I visited information at the introductory sessions.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; selection boards for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it works in real life.
There's more to it.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
Training goes through every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alice, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not symmetrical.
One short neck, the other boy’s shapeless figure, weighs more than the normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women, such as Jennifer López, who owns more luxuriant breasts and thighs and narrow waists, and not to wear them too provocative.
For example, if the difference in waist and thighs is so large that it is not possible to pick up a suit or a pair of pants, it is worth having at least one item sewn on the order.
You obviously don't regret the money you have invested, because the ideally sitting clothes are priceless.
You'll feel a lot better in the suit, handcuffed to order, than the one that keeps riding, rolling, stripping the waist, etc.
The owners of boys' figures, on the other hand, may wear clothing with rugs, application, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've got a week to figure it out.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Every participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for some celebrity, day and night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing, and the type of figure.
I have Miranda Kerr to wear, which you may know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy for myself because her clothes are much simpler than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who recently recovered a ton (please bear in mind that I am exaggerating), or very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of the magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic imagery.
It's important to keep a graphical style in mind.
Not only does the stylist dress real people, but he creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
The Stylist Needs General Knowledge
Saturday’s lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, revived three professional guests in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-trunch can be worn normally, above jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without any bumps, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
However, I most appreciated the advice: "For your work you must perfectly know the rules."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
I finally realized here why we're going to screw up all the definitions and rules that combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I found out that a stylist should have more equipment options than the number of photos he needs to take.
For example, for a fashion review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 rounds), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, clothes often look and work in conjunction with others in a very different way than in reality.
We have to think about it when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing eye, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards stylists in the Czech Republic remains rather cool.
Even well-known people often think it's superfluous (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to expect them to call us another (less) size than they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have ever written anything about some celebrity fatter/skinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that the stylist was not well - equipped and able to get along.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to judge people, not to create them, and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away all her clothes, he told her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you can praise, and advise that you can carry with them," Mario said.
He also showed us that a working bag should be specifically placed.
It's a bag that you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rolls or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylers use it when taking pictures of certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (bottles and similar objects are prohibited because they are cutting off clothing) or a sewing kit.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to do the right shoe pads.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged - not to mention street shots.
And now we've got a glue.
You don't have to touch shoes with scissors so you don't spoil them.
That requires real skill.
I was glad Mario commended my work.
Those skills didn't come to my senses.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What should have been a carefree walk had become a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and careless errors.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but it did not matter, since no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before leaving the new version with the subtitle "The Escape", there was great hope.
It was expected that it would move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game, where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with the NFS, a lot differs from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is that several unnecessary mistakes have been made in this series of games for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an inexplicable line of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're part of a story whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by engaging in an illegal race across America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
A few interesting features are involved.
The route consists of 10 stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race runs on its own route, each stage takes place in a diverse and interesting environment.
There is therefore no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some routes are pleasant to look at.
Still, the game does not produce strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race brings back to life an unusual detail from time to time.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to get a few competitors (in fact, a regular race); then you try to improve the time (a standard race with a timer); or you compete with one opponent.
Among other things, you come across the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him, pushing the buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could have expected (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it's not enough; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The racing model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered a flaw.
If you're looking for real life simulations, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very good for dynamic racing, although there are better options in the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driver's model, the collision model isn't so good.
You don't expect that kind of game to change and clash, but if you don't have any idea how your car's gonna behave, something's not.
Usually, running or driving past a car in a dense stream, you sometimes touch the other car a little bit, but sometimes in almost the same situation your car starts to creak.
Or the intrusions were broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you crash or leave the route far away, the game will bring you back to the point where it crashed.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start a race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't quite rely on it.
Sometimes the restarts are not enough, and you have to learn at least a part of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian vehicles at a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying when you see your opponent easily drive between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you are driving there, the cars are already located in such a way that you either need to drive them around or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you get close to them; it's all arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game you find several places where, regardless of time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you are heading in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's coming to you, he's making it worse for you to review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand trying to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get more and more irritable.
Too bad, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is busy and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what you don't miss -- a concept with fifty unique routes, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the charges along the way, because it is on them that your car may change, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for direct cuts of the highway; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain routes.
The main mode of story mode is closely connected to the mode challenge mode; these are the races on individual plots that you will learn on the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and glasses, common to challengees and stories regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels: starting with cars and ending with profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares your results with that of other players and provides communication with the public.
Here is another flaw that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the tunnel of the subway, where you race in the dark.
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say it is) when suddenly a subway train runs into your rear, turning your car into a scrap metal chest.
For several days, our editors discussed whether no one really thought for a second at the time of the game, or whether its creators really think we are such morons.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video is most pleasant, sometimes even shocking.
Although in some critical moments the quality of the recording is sometimes quite low.
This is especially true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good record would not be particularly helpful to you.
The sound's fine; the soundtrack is on the lover.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'entered compositions of different styles'; but few people will buy the game because of its music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The escape is pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS over the past few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of inadequacy.
Of course it's a good time, but get ready to see the flaws blind you like an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to EU Vicenova:
Czechs have the reputation of bad people and skeptics as regards the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable differences between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a cruel war to happen."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to stabilize, at least in some way, and all players to get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vitzenov began his lecture in law school.
It has demonstrated the nature of its motto “A Clear and Open About Europe” in the first part of its lecture, where it described individual EU institutions and relations between them so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the KU Faculty of Law would envy them.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said he was a regular gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I must say, everyone was struck by how well he did with his role."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, perfectly communicate with them and has a clear picture of the EU's development."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, “Who is the European Union? What number should I call on?"; i.e., as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses
Vicenova continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She described the Czech presidency as successful last year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused great damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have triggered the ongoing countdown.
Moreover, the new EU seven-year budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, what areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and less; all those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "Europe, Understandable Language".
"I really don't like cutbacks, foreign words and jargons that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses.'
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Fast Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that Czechs consider Euro skeptics; as well as people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, a Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Vishergrad Group again?" and he's not happy about it."
In the future, the Union of Vicenova expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not more fast, Europe more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone. "
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to unite, whereas those who did not want to remain side by side.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; this will be a real two-speed Europe,” awaits Vicenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries and not only those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM's novelist enters the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long."
IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution for the general public; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was founded by its first boss, Thomas J. Watson senior dreamer.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His "Dumay" slogan thus became a stamp around which the life of a future giant (and also the name of his internal journal, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
Over the first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
Over the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says Samuel J. Palmizano, current head of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson addressed the issue of care for employees, just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB staff were among the first US employees to receive paid leave, insurance from employers, elegant uniforms and a complex bonus system for better inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is the same.
From the very beginning, the company had a brilliant use of talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
Agreed with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan by which the woman, Virginia Rometti, would replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations occur.
No wonder many ideas work for about half a million people.
Organization with Good Reputation
The firm's position in business is strong in internal and external image.
“From the outset, IBM was more of an organization than a technological company,” said Professor Harvard Business School of Economics and the author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Colony of Forrester Research consulting company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or Blue Giant, as he is called in the United States because of his logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company, developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (first place with Apple), paving Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on several platforms - if they don't work, it refuses them.
This distinguishes, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and experiencing Windows crashes, his operating system.
Forward-looking technology
IBM ' s core income is derived from services, about one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
In 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was the first to hit the world.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the Great Depression.
So far, IBM doesn't seem to have caused any damage to the current crisis.
Since early 2008, IBM's stock price has risen by a record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have been growing steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but your own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from the raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, "The Corporation of Calculations, Tabulations, Records" was quite complex.
It called it IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for business offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were based on a merger of four companies whose history began in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "tablet clocks", i.e. clocks that fixed the time when staff members came and left work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the Board of Trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then, the founder of IBM, in the shadow of Watson's ideas, remains the basis for an insurmountable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the title, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from raw knives and butchers to cashiers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the profits doubled to nine million dollars, and the company’s extensive expansion on all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his position in the principal's chair took over his son, Thomas Watson, Jr.
Under its leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM personnel and computers helped NASA control space flights, to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, man flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first family of computers in 1964 - IBM line System/360.
A classic PC, which defined computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold Lenovo's computers, while purchasing PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting office, thus concentrating fully on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to use technology wisely in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban governance.
In the area of commercial, IBM recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research group dealing with speech recognition is also working.
Richtarzova about his unfaithful husband:
Yvette, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge, 53, became a bodyguard and lover of Yvette Bartoshova (45), Darin still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she marked clear rules for her future life.
"Beep can come home, but not as my partner," Richtarzov explained.
When Darina Richtarzhov provided Bartoshova’s blood in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Even though she made Yvette leave Riccan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darin gave up, pretending to have made peace with her husband's novel; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarz and Bartoshov break up someday, his wife won't take him with her arms spread out.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kick him out."
"But he will end his days, not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom he binds me," said Richtarzov, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and insisted only on the two sides.
As long as Joseph had no objection to his wife’s rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm going to be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave her marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am in charge of repairs, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, except we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge in Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzov finds new love, he won't be in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend with.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Yvette, and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worse women's habits: do they concern you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains that you go shopping all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like doing big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who of you will give up walking around the clothing store looking for the perfect clothes and illustration of them (in different color options) in the model?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men, it can become a living hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five pounds-- maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you have to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to constant complaints by their partners in their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more frequent such complaints arise, the more women annoy them.
Most important of all, order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Mojka glass, dust cleaning, floor wash, dusting, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on a clean coffeehouse in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “deviation”, try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that your family should not have order and cleanliness in the first place.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
The Power to Command
"Hold your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood it, women would not have to command them so often...
Split
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, each one of us is a gossip.
Let's be honest, that's the obvious nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise the others, who, especially in the women's labour force, pose a great danger to their environment.
The resulting transmissions of the Yagra and the Vorocec helped Philly win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful handovers of the hockey striker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win the 5-3 on Caroline's ice, again becoming the most successful Czech match player.
In both cases Claude Jiro used the experience of a 30 - year - old star; he added another transmission and was named the best player in the match.
Two effective match broadcasts also belonged to the player on the same team with Jagro Yakubu Voracek.
After the match, Jagre told foreign journalists that he had foretold Jiru a wonderful evening.
"I told him before the match that he would kill the hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel such things," said Jagre, after whose actions Jiru scored at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later on, the second goal of the team also had a Czech lead.
The closing Harrickins Voracek captured the Tsaiba and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who was killed in circles.
In a second before the first break, the play by Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with many advantages, but the Flyers were brought back at the beginning of the second time.
Especially Jiru.
After giving the Jagra, he scored the third goal; his blow was then turned into Wayne Simmons' fourth goal.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely into three of the best," said Jagr, praising his centreman.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruut and the Dwyer penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the platter, I rushed, and Reed crossed over to the far end."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," Vorachek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech team, Jaroslav Spaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to the injury to the upper body.
Together with the experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the penalty series.
Tomasz Plekanic couldn't have been killed during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was upset with a large number of injuries in the back because the match ended only with five defenders.
It's a bad situation.
"We finished the match with only one seasoned player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the platypus out of our zone."
“What was our weakness,” added P.K. Subban
After 30 attacks by Czech Golic Onjay Pavelec helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The naked Jets, who interrupted the five - mother series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Changes in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourism.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, tourist agencies at that time mostly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists drove to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crime in the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both Black Sea countries); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that socialist citizens (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, it was not possible to travel individually.
At the time, travel agencies were offering trips to the West, but it was either standing in line all night, sleeping bag, or having "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was needed for travel to the West, and it was not granted to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely converted; it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most of the time, Czechs spent their vacations at home, which resulted in a large number of cottages and summer homes, this habit persists today.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the real revolution.
Whereas until 1989, GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, Czechs had spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that until 1989 we were unable to freely visit Croatia's most popular now, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, and this marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough to travel to the west, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was short of a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was its desire to bring its own food (conservations, salamis, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown, and decades later our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular charter flights, and compared to the past, airlines have now become incredibly cheap because of the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of the post-revolution journeys occurred in 2000, leading to the historic first direct charter voyage from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been carried by Czech tourists to the warm exotic countries, leaving the Czech Republic through twelve exotic routes in winter.
About 100,000 Czechs now visit exotic countries every year!
And another important development of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, and my country has thus become the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in 2008 Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person while travelling abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
General Assembly to elect President, Pat's threat returns
There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gashek, head of the Czech Football Association (FACR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday, for about five months.
There is still no agreement on the rules of elections to be followed.
Without that, the vote for one of the three candidates would not begin.
Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik want to lead Czech football.
When he left his post in June, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong figure to lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Gasheka era again loaded football between the two chambers of association, which could not select a single candidate.
This became quite evident on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
Members of the general assembly had arrived at the National House in Prague, Smikhov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly - only legitimate representatives or also officials who had been given powers.
That moment had since been partially resolved thanks to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that a mission based on the authority granted could not be established.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board was also not very helpful, although it was the question that was being addressed mainly at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
Presentations on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how do we get to round 3 and avoid the road?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established rules or to find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FACR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the statutory model, the winner of round 3 is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia reportedly agrees to compromise to consider the winner of the election as the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage ratio, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
“Therefore, two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers”, he agreed with Moravia, and said that it would have been better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
In a sense, Thomas Paclik agrees with his opinion, although the electoral rules defined by the statute estimate that Pelta is more suitable than other candidates.
"I would like the election to go as far as possible."
“I want to avoid all possible representational nonsense, as in the previous general assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzeń, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his statements, he was largely contradicted by Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would become famous in Nimburg; he also hoped that future candidates would cooperate constructively.
"All emotional count will be calmed after today's expected exit to the European Championship national assembly."
“The football will be back on a happy day, people will be more willing to cooperate,” says the representative of Jablonec, who has the most experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Reichl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another collapse of the common congregation."
"I hope it makes sense to win," said Reichle.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
For some information, individual negotiations were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight that had to be carried, among others, by the vice-presidents of Dalibor Kucher and Reich to Podgorica did not depart from Prague in the morning due to technical failure.
In the end, meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can become crucial.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobes, would like the parties to come to an agreement with the strongest sports association in the country.
A great deal has been placed on the map: government grants; football creditworthiness; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with a new Czech sports director after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik's in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, prior to the extraordinary general meeting, the head of footballers, Plzeň Tomas Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his demands for the President of the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high office.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said the CTK.
The motive of Paclik to fight Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Reich is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favourite of the elections, from entering the FAČR administration.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that if he wins, he will remain President only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager who was not too involved in football life.
"I've talked to a few people I might think of."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change my mind," he said.
The main disagreement between Paclik and Pelt is currently related to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Pilsen, and Berbr is a man of conflicting reputation who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the voices of delegates of the general assembly.
Paclik thus finds it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation remains unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of a good businessman, this would be even more damaging to football," said Paclik.
He points to the fact that Pelta's name was recorded several years ago while listening to the phones during the investigation of the corruption case; Pelta escaped the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who is now not mentioning his previous statement that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became president".
If Paclik wins Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the universal assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He would be the first person I would ever turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present him in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
"I also don't have a nose for what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge's brigade led by Ludek Macelai, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims that he will risk managing the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he managed the Pilsen team, which, through it, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better."
“To limit the influence of some groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to repulsive situations,” said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta, Daniel Kržetinski.
One of its priorities will be the strengthening of the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it will lobby at the highest political level for the provision of more money for sport from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points for the new president."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not consider its link to the Pilsen Club a burden, although he claims that the President of FACR should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the apple tree, and Rajl is connected to the Prague Duklo.
"It's not an ideal option."
"I still don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my stock to Pilsen to someone else when I'm going back in six months," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would avoid the electoral Pat
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, a candidate for presidents, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was chosen, he would fight for new FAČR rules to avoid disputes over election rules in the future.
Prior to Thursday's talks in Nimburg, the Jabloneca official remains optimistic and believes that attention from the electoral struggle will be a significant distraction to today's expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the last-minute elections before the last general meeting, and a two-month delay could therefore be useful to him to stand up for his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is time for someone to head the association,” argues a person, mainly associated with the Jablonec Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gashek’s reign.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general assembly in June."
“If different means of representation were not adopted, we would have had a president from September,” Pelt said.
He referred to the signing of a key civil association document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my own personal task, and I intend to assume personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
“This is a fundamental issue that we cannot live without”, Pelt argues.
Besides, he says he's not trying to set himself up in front of rivals.
In the past, he has stated that he can present his cooperation with Jindrich Reich, whom he appreciates for legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and made some success."
"Whatever the case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people surprised the methods of his election campaign."
“Although some of them now question his true identity,” Pelt said of his competitor, Pelt himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapons to be the knowledge of football, from low-level competitions to national assembly.
The national assembly must represent the entire football.
“I would also try to put an end to all incidents, beginning with the cases of the gods or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Right after that, I would focus on the negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for all football”, the 40-year-old candidate said two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the football head would not entail the dismissal of the staff.
"I'm going to need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." That was his message to Borov, where the prolonged period of interpower is causing a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believed that the delegates would not come to Nimburg for nothing on Thursday.
“If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it.”
“The football needs the trust it can gain by choosing its leader at last,” said Pelt, who remained optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, FACR will work actively
If the Vice President-President-in-Office of the Czech Football Association is present on Thursday, many people in the Association will be dissatisfied.
Rachel promises that if he is chosen, the time for hard work will come.
He wants to change the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the deity; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national collection, professional football and youth football events”.
"I don't want to say I'll do it all myself," said Reichl in his interview for the CTK.
“I am a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member concentrates on a specific area.”
"I will carefully assign the tasks so that in each of these segments, football will take great steps forward."
"It will probably not appeal to many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement had allegedly caused him to question his candidacy.
"I both know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if that makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who stick to my wheels and question my every step," he explained.
"There are many people who have told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't deny," he said.
Moreover, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he had started with Gasek.
"The greater amount of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to break it all."
“There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I do not want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gasek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, which is hardly the competent Mirek Pelta."
"He's surrounded by people who would play football so that he'd only be available to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused in a lot of ways, but not in subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the charges that he will only be the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to argue the contrary, I plan to make the most of it for Moravia."
“For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league.”
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three moral teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reichl.
While the president's club manager, Plzeň Tomas Paclik, has not dared to evaluate his chances of winning.
“Thereby, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success,” said Reichl. To his success, he refers to the savings of tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of contracts with television and the negotiation of the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelt had been “removed from the creditworthiness process of Czech football”, he considered another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who had something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant personnel changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," Rychl said of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful basins
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's swimming pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try the incredible water in Europe - and relax the standing body in the Jacuzzi after a tour of the city or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
One thing Iris Meder could not have done during her research tours for the last six and a half years: without her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the taste-formed dome, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool and loved carefully restored arnuvo-style swimming pools.
She was eager to add every favorite pool to her notebook, with important details of the building and the history of the building.
The architect Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing), which included everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic swimming castles in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Her “travel trip to the most unusual swimming pools in Central Europe” was carried out through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true bathing enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only drawback is that swimmers have to deal with the blue brown tiles and the scent of chlorine, while runners can breathe the auspicious smell of pine forests or listen to the joyous chirping of birds in the park.
"Once upon a time, I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splash in the pool and the oil in the sauna is a health factor in the baths, because Meder thinks that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take on the work, "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is clearly reflected: high ceilings, coloured tiles and tramples.
An illustrated 190 - page publication entitled "The Joy of Bathing" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis -- and it makes you want to jump into the water.
A water collector, Meder, discovered several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found rich nitrated water in a karst cave (The Cave bath in Miskolz-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with noir water in a bottle building (Városi Termalfürdö in Yasber) as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Sechen bath in Budapest.
From many heated open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see the whole Zurich swimming pool on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from an open pool in St. Anthony.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld, the Ectala Aqua Council looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it raises a pair of three open crawfish that appear to be very small in the background of the Ecktal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool gatherer didn't see the smell of chlorine in each pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell gray, Arpad's baths smell so much oil in Bequeschab that you may find it hard to believe you're in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in the intestinal water, and the water is almost black from the eel that sticks to the skin as soon as you enter the pool, the healing experience of a particular type.
At some point, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites, and when she tried to visit the open swimming pool of the Czech swimming pool in Lugachovici, she discovered that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the red and white-yellow windows in Arnuvo style, she saw the locusts growing between the coffee tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Castle of thermal waters in Bud Wilbad.
You will find not only neo-Romanian elements after the construction in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Mauritian Hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favourite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basins, and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
“This is a real achievement, so masterful to combine such different architectural styles,” said Meder.
To climb into a thermal pool in a palace like this is clearly a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation on the world’s poor.
The Executive Director plans to amend in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people worldwide.
The findings were presented in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis by a consumer organization of Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the game at world commodity exchange rates raises prices - and banks are therefore involved in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer defenders is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Akkermann, although large bank houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
Initially, commodity rates were designed as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have renounced the rules of supply and demand - and are benefiting from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism, promising to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “is worth risking a good reputation for Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation must be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode welcomed the news by stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “The food price gains are an egregious example of how thoughtless banks are currently acting against the common interests.”
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“The Bank must remove all investments that make money at food prices from the portfolio,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Akkermann’s quick reaction was surprising at first, but the director wished to have an impeccable image just a few months before his office was finished.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he need to care for expenses — the consequences of having to deal with his successor.
Anyone else would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, conducted for the Forsa Social Research and Statistical Analysis Institute on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
No more than eleven per cent believe that the investments that make the food price are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
A Pauline in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsowski
A architectural history with lifts, falls and happy endings, and a pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
Pavilion Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass panels, boldly expressing faith in technological progress.
Pavillon Schvantzer won the Grand Prix in 1958 for his easy steaming construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, it was celebrated worldwide in 1973 by its legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and its sister, a glass building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Venea Station, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the 20th Century House for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which works of art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the contemporary art in Vienna had reached a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the 21st Century House and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belvedere Museum office, which will open the first exhibition Tuesday night, in all respects, a joyful event.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Austrian Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslain-Arco, a graduate of the Department of Art history with a brilliant career in youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Modernism in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue reconstruction, attract public funds and private donations and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to provide permanent exhibits of the Fritz Votuba Foundation, cafe and bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was also to be built.
Strictly controlling the & limited budget
The Krishanits were the ideal candidate for the project at the time.
He was known, of course, as a result of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Sectionsion, Josef Albrich, and won the contest, but he also studied with Schwantzer at the University of Vienna of Technology, and the pavilion was “excellently an important place” for him, where he attended exhibitions “almost every week”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was “an energy absorber, ” says Krishanits.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, glass safety glass was reinforced, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The permanent translations of the thermal bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, the burning of the light well between the building and the street, providing the lighting of a virtually new building, but still an excellent pavilion of Schwancer.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old red-brown color of protection against corrosion.
Hall theater is the same as it used to be.
All of this under the strict control of museum management and with limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would be approved by museum management," said Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven wall in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite restrictions, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the "Brussels Pavilion" was a rough one - a typical story of the "craps in the city".
Such an architecture is “not always in its place” and nevertheless wants to “increasing real awareness”.
The 21st-century house is in the very right place, because there was an unexpected success in planning the city, and a fully reconstructed main railway station with offices and residential property is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may take place. The 21st-century house may be complemented by the second Krishanitsa building - the collector Francesca von Gabsburg acquired Berlin's Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the town about its location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the abolition of trains in winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter train wear and tear.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, the Bild newspaper reports that up to 2015, a total investment of around 300 million euros is planned.
Investments are designed to improve the capacity of locomotives and railway networks even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed personnel involved in cleaning the snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice to work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of lifting and delaying trains this winter at a meeting with heads of government and industry two months ago.
In the last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as she was short of reserves when weather conditions deteriorated.
Many new regional trains of years awaited the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There have also been some delays with ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE trains much more frequently over the years after one of the ICE trains broke down at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay millions of pounds a fine in the United States
New troubles followed the turmoil surrounding Josef Akkermann, director - general of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Banku faces a fine in the United States of America of millions of pounds.
According to Deutsche Bank, there were few problems in the home, and the past of the U.S. industrial giant has now driven him, while Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay 145 million euros ($106 million), to calm down disputes arising from the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose with the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are glad that we have solved this problem without bringing the parties to court,” said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Office (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and interferes with bankruptcy processes to protect consumers' contributions.
NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses that are poured out of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by the pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed up by internal loans.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble hit the real estate market in the United States in 2007.
The US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long time to live in September 2008 on the brink of a financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with a storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The largest claim wave is the Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of acquiring money from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts for about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a threat of prosecution by FHFA over numerous agreements totalling $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
The Baffet Financial Guru is actively investing in IBM IT.
Since March, he bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, America's largest investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed its view on investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM offered services and bought computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were seen as a knight's errand.
IBM, an IT-industry veteran, has now been named Sir IBM.
In an interview with the United States business network, CNBC Baffet reported that it had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding, Berkshire Hathaway, became one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had known nothing about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which was able to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a great job," said Baffet, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has spent considerable time focusing on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The computer industry founder, who is now over 100 years old, also offers software and counselling services as well as powerful computers for business.
Buffett's been avoiding tech companies.
He claimed he was only investing in the company that he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and machinery.
Its Berkshire Hathaway holding holds shares in the long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired Berkshire Hathaway's small textile company in the 1960s and built one of the world's most expensive companies with skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest.
Making him a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost flawless instinct in making money brought him the name "The Oracle of Omaha".
The price of IBM shares rose by one percent before the opening of the markets after the announcement of Baffet's investments.
Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, stands on the $220 billion stock exchange, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The imminent danger
After the identification of the Tsvikkau “saws”, Turkish media began to question the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “blood ideology” that is now rising again to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 resulted from the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish German community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears, such as the right-wing attacks on Turks since the fires in Mellan in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing network that has now been discovered has an extent that is not yet fully understood.
"The revival of blood ideology?" was the title of the internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah notes, on the other hand, that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly by mentioning victims of racial hatred with a silent picket at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries has been presented in a positive light, as a success story.
The announcement in some Turkish media was like crap. "The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on a series of murders.
Also, the German edition of Hürriyet did not miss the occasion to hold this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the column by Ahmeth Külahji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and their work have been killed and have made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
Police behaviour and subsequent successful raids were severely criticised by German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of following suspects in the right-wing circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. “If they continue to act in a similar way, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves.”
"It'll be the best self-defense."
“The peace in Germany depends very heavily on how the entire network is exposed and on the rightfulness of the punishment,” says Selen.
The crimes in Melnène and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
A photograph of burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply recorded in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among Turks.
Do not repeat past errors
During that period, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Kinkel, in his speech, took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne to calculate the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he has determined the value of a human being with the taxes that it pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened.
Having made it clear what must be done now in addition to the efforts to identify and re-evaluate the right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe ' s risk-oriented policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely turned around during the financial crisis and has since been constantly coping with one crisis.
Now it must be returned to the correct course by the German.
Alex Webber certainly didn't suspect that he was going to play that role.
In July, following his successful resignation from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would start working in an equally effective position, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, the UBS for its renewed strength and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Filiger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
Trader UBS in London bypassed bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know when Alex Webber will finally take office?
Weber should consult the bank from February 2012.
And, according to the bank, on Tuesday, the presidency of the Council will take place in May rather than in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Centre Bank, not a traditional banker, and will undoubtedly need time for adaptation.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it has managed the largest assets in the world - and, on the other hand, has not emerged from scandals.
The proud Swiss bank doesn't seem to be saving anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time a hunting asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in the investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus managing more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank, it became the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long been teaching at the Institute for the Banking of Zurich University, explains: “I have always brought UBS students as a model of a good bank”.
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I might have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the Executive Director, Peter Wuffley, was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he had left.
The Bank ' s investment unit tried to play in substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in capital to counter the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors from which many bankers would have recently been politely refused - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden so much that even its name has not been reported.
It was just a first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, second-level salary leader of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster, and due to a lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased toxic securities from UBS for an untitled number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for the convertible bond with the mandatory conversion to become the master of the bank.
Switzerland was all shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of large banks being founded in a small country.
Finally, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times higher than all production of Switzerland (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transfer data from wealthy clients who may have been taxed by a bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of a refund of undue business income plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich clients is the curtain of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
customers' money is starting to come out.
Within a few months, the Bank lost confidence in both its main activities - investment because of failed speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And everything just calmed down, and it seemed that UBS was able to break the situation of the crash with the trader, and the only trader had brought down 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet operational.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had not changed enough,” said Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute for Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “UBS has no risk control tool”.
It is caution that has long been done by Swiss bankers by the custodians of the world's largest assets - not too much risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of immeasurable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her mood is a classic in itself.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich, Bankhofstrassa, which leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow hats of Swiss mountains.
The buildings are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry companies such as Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credi Suisse Palace and elite private banks, such as Julius Barr.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There's a big leather couch along the marble-covered walls, and there's a big safe near the symbol bank.
UBS knows what his clients need, reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point gave up Swiss banking concepts - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper, like all Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large, in particular in the investment banking, where Anglo-Saxes are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've adapted long ago to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed UBS, brought it the first large profits, and then the fiasco, and no other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million made the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” writes Lucas Hessig in his book UBS Crash.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If I asked the Swiss banks, they would say that the problem was mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, one being a rich but degree bank that specialized in Zurich to manage assets; the other not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money they could use to spin the ever-powered wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says Bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wulfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, which went all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember well the meetings of government members, at which Wulfley has always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the “tourage chart” where the banks had been successful.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make some of this trip.
UBS was the largest player in currency trade and government securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot, and under what is called “permanent income” in banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in US mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its established hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that brought together securities based on US mortgages and sold them further, continuing to carry the risks.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave as the bank tried to get it in order was more difficult than it seemed at first.
UBS posts have become a child's game with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
Anyone who rules this huge bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities need to be significantly narrowed down.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact considered only as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly separated from his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past time, he has been able to demonstrate his character and now, according to the Turkish bank on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the condition it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Webber.
In public, he still said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Circumstances in Europe bring down the American Stock Exchange
The upcoming recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.

The legendary investor Warren Buffett was able only to confirm these fears, and in a CNBC interview, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.

Designed crows fill cities
Players are considered to be troublesome birds in many places, and experts now say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be expelled from the cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the city’s landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants of mud and noise are growing in many settlements.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first crow symposium in the town of Lar in East Frisian, experts argued that the player could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in the cities was in the migration of specially protected players, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting out traditional trees made life more difficult for birds.
Crows are under guard.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest of Jever, Diphholce, Achim under Bremen and Lere, there are large colonies of more than 600 parents.
A mixed project of the crow shooting in Lere has generated unapproved newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described bird trappings and batting them as particularly cruel.
"Ordinary displacement and intimidation don't do anything," said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
The lowering of the nets of streams of water or the edge of trees often has undesirable effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals dissipate, and large colonies divide and extend to other areas.”
Disturbment is possible only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them, get rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Keller.
The combination of the intimidation of birds from those in need of protection of residential areas and their incentive to return to other areas could be an exit.
"The information booths instead of benzopils" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Utoi Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of an educational crow road in Asherberg, Schleswig-Golstein, where information about the lives of the very crafted players is provided on the information stands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jørgens also expressed her opinion about the noise complaints made by the birds: "The noise conveys a lot of information; they have a lot to say to each other."
These birds' minds and minds have entered legends, and players often use not only tools to take possession of the lookout, but also make the tools themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested a bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they needed to be knocked on the board to obtain a moth’s larva.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the daughter.
In another experiment, suitable players had to meet a more complex challenge.
The researchers put a small bucket of moth with a larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their prey by bait.
But the researchers gave them a piece of wire.
All four birds used wires to make hooks and use hooks to lock the handle behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have done it since the first attempt.

After the attack on Elder Post at the Bosnians' 36th minute fine site, Stark decided that the Portuguese game was simulated and showed him a yellow card.

After the break of the Vice-champion of Europe in 2004, the account was secured by four more goals.
Peter Jiraček was dissolving all remaining doubts about the Czechs for 81 minutes.
The European champions of 1976 are sent to the European Championship for the fifth consecutive term.

Damianovich struck at 40th minute from the end of the fine and nearly killed the naked Czech.
After the stall break, she saved the Czech World Class Goldie after FC Seoul had left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than the night 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt now that the coach of the Hus Hiddink assembly will now release the seat on the bench of a team that has passed to third place in 2002, Croatians are the fourth time in the European final round.
The Turks were almost perfectly able to launch 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium.
A further blow from Seljuk Inan for the seventh minute fell into the stand, and Kazim Kazim’s attacker failed to hit the ball in the net.
After that, Croatia woke up and became increasingly engrossed in the control of the game.
After the break the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Legionaires Bundesliga Daniel Pranic (Babaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were in the field with Mario Manjukic from the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perishic from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattons are going to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro since Germany in 1988.

Constantine Vasiliev from the guest team compared the account to 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good turn from the start, but only for 23 minutes did Robbie Keen of Los Angeles make his first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent him from moving Ireland forward.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
A listed company named Dax reported on Thursday that it is going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development, and we will take thousands of people to work” said Bill McDermott, an executive director of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The population of 2,500 should grow to 4,500.
The world market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
The SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chandu and Daliane.

Mass killings - human dimension
Peter Englund's book "Beautiful and Grief: Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart dies.
Here is how to read further: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You'll meet these people very close to Mr. Englund's story, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, as one of these men and women, you'll be out of the way and lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "working on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, hunting journalists, or discussions on tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains how much "the book of what it looked like," it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and the state of the spirit."
The Book of Beauty and Grief has united the experience of military years of 20 more or less invisible men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets caught, loses a hand or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are measured here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of history books.
That is, the amendment to the notion that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the West Front.
Beauty and Grief can give the panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A soldier in the book falls on bee hives; one meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the flies of the tsetse.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, which smells like smokeless dust.
When you hear a canonade and you're a woman and you're at home with children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," Mr. Englund observes, "is filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, binding ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
Beauty and Grief follow the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives can be frightening or fascinating, but they are highly alive thanks to the small moments and bits collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
When telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, non-real rubber, paper bandages, wooden sticks."
He continues to talk about the erzac chicken in Germany.
It describes “the meat of the pressed rice cooked in fat barrels (and painted with a false bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; the shoes covered with wood”.
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat authorised in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories speak of honor and courage.
One American sees the urge to be cruel and says of war: “You feel that, after all, it is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a best-seller, and to claim that this display is a civilization and under your fine-tuned shirt, there is no barbar.”
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
“When a person is reconciled with the idea of self - sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of an audience”, he writes.
But it's the other way around. It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's kind of like, "the man who's been hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
“Conflict was becoming an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “the war of factories”.
He notes the arrival of the one he calls "a new species in the besties of the beginning century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-dressed suit that sets up a cut, sitting at a written table."
People act in an unpredictable way: lower acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who tried hard to get away from prostitutes of venereal disease in order to avoid service on the front.
“The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of high-priced manure, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in hopes of going to hospital,” he writes.
"He was put in the eyes of all despair, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves prose by Mr. Englund flex, but non-bright, beautifully suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “delivered completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books of World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or such novels as "The West Front Without Change" by Erich Maria Remark, not by exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book goes into this uncharted pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in unartificial literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it was as if he had reached a page from the book with a list of characters, pulled it out of your hand, and set it on fire.
After a previous error - a thorough journey
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some in protective helmets.
The night watches from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there must have been fewer people in the Zukotti park at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said that they were going to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, his presence emphasized the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
There could also be no repetition of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of the gas list against protesters, which was contrary to the department ' s rules and caused the public ' s sympathy for the occupiers by hurricane.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to liberate Zukotti Park protestors began.
Authorities were preparing to observe occupations unfolding in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randalls Island, based on Zukotti.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - in view of Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in "last minute," said a source familiar with orders that referred to the task only as "training."
"The few cops I know who were summoned to this case didn't say they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke in anonymous terms.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson he learned from the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but withdrew from hundreds of protesters who had rushed inside before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, officers from various police units participated, including police forces from the districts, which were usually used to control criminal areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as if they were at work, come and leave the park during the day, making one hour of the night the right time for the visit.
"It was right to do so when the least people were in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The search engine and the prerecorded announcements made by loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
Police reported that tents had not been moved until 1:45 p.m., allowing protestors time to gather things.
Other groups of police officers, according to eyewitnesses, were meeting at the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through the breast of the protestor's personal belongings, including bags, plastic blankets and polyethylene bags, full of clothes, the Sanitary Department's teams followed her, collecting what was left behind.
Some protestors who refused to leave were taking pictures of this out of the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some had built barricades, and the police were inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp epicenter were holding hands together.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were summoned to cut the locks.
No arrests were held in the park until approximately 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for “infringing public order and resisting detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and an officer in the department, was the highest-ranking officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's police force, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not run the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case we had to go inside.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, in the neighborhood north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the quarter south.
Observers have seen police expanding the perimeter even further across the Soundotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further away.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m. from Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, blew air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of flannel flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school staff service union will go to the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to apply to the city on Wednesday, arguing that the dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were studying.
The trial is probably the last available trade union of District Council 37, attempting to abolish dismissal.
Sixty-six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the focal point for work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling the political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the last spring ' s budget.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, the Chancellor of the Dennis M. Walcott Schools said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One board member paralysed, told him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Education Department that they had filed a complaint against them; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of the complaint to the Supreme Court of the State in Manhattan.
The appeal will identify Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as defendants and list eight temporary employees as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, like most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint at New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in the poor areas of the city to support an unfair treatment claim, arguing that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in the upper East Side or Tribeki schools, 17 school support workers lost their jobs in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The union also claims that the school director may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of the focal points for work with the parents.
The notification used the word “excess” although “excess” was more often referred to when a teacher from the school ' s payroll was transferred to a list of employees with salaries paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six focal points for parental work have been dismissed,” says a claim in the draft, “and not just transferred.”
Mission complete, Congress ready for Libya agreement
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to go, the old dictator Muammar Qaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who commends Libyans for a successful uprising and American troops for “resistance”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This confirms the support of their democratic aspirations by both parties.”
Tongue may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya was easily held.
During the summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the United States Army in the NATO mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing the limited use of the American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the votes of both parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would cut down the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so much evil as to really knock the soil out of her feet.
Afterwards, the Congress was indecisive.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “regards the people of Libya for its incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or split up legislators like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Committee of Republicans, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives this week should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they have not tried.
Gudlat ' s amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been raised in this convening.
Some duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “control over federal expenditures”.
Some of them are identical, but give their authors, mostly newly elected Republicans, an opportunity to admire their summaries, to boast that they have made such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of Congress members, and José Serrano (Democrat, New York) is a member of the House of Representatives, who wants to lift the two-time limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the state opposes them.
As Congress members sought to propose amendments, they were moving at a faster pace than they had in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 66 at the 110th.
This pace will be measured as compared to the early 1990s, when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, 27, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Breaked but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt
Ten months after the armed man fired at her in the light of a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives of Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a federal channel, cheered up a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Be Back" and said he wanted to heal more than to return to Congress.
After appearing on the 20/20 programme of Ei bi-si News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery after a bullet struck her skull and pierced her left brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the draft debt limit bill.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 were wounded, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang, and called her recovery "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special edition of 20/20, which was shown before the release of the new book of the husbands of Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The SWAT team told us about the Giffords recovery after the shooting on January 8th.
On the video taken in the first few weeks, Kelly is lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Gifford sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teaching her how to do simple things.
Keep your head down.
Get your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word: “Toast”, a request to change the menu for breakfast.
The video shown by Aibi shows that music played a central role in the healing of the Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors "Girls Just Wanted to Have Fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told her that he had read the Giffords article in the March 12th shooting paper, when she stopped him to ask for the first time the six that were killed.
Suspected assailant Gerd Lee Lafner is detained in Misuri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not beaten," said Kelly.
You're just beat up.
And you'll get through it, you'll get better and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers Feel More Grief Than Respect
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock did a ballad on helplessness, disappointment and loss.
A few hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines were signaled to build around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded his desk.
"The soldiers were viewed as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring money collection.
The senior military officer at the concert, also attended by the then Chairman of the Staff Chiefs Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans” was written by an officer in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Quite the opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American audience.
The troops are being commended for their sacrifices.
But commendations have a price, the soldiers say.
The audience is increasingly acting as if it were feeling sorry for people in shape.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon on his way to Afghanistan.
"But the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy people."
This is a sensitive theme for soldiers who do not want to appear ungrateful or unthankful to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the mourning talks take place quietly and only between veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, Colonel Mark Kenshan warned them in resignation that non-military personnel would be looking at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have struck the rebels and visited exotic sites.
Others will wonder if “the mask of an evil veteran” is hidden,” said Kenshin, who fought in Iraq and took up a high government position in Washington.
While looking for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking whether he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington right after the war.
Kenshn remembers him saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you must expect a negative effect."
The discomfort experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield rarely comes from a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was generally in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Bernow, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of trips they have made, the number of companions they have lost, or the extent of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, at historic hearings, it must be decided whether 28 men and women against the army will be sued for non-reaction to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up next.
First-class Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, allegedly raped by her co-worker at night.
It was October 2008, and she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another man carrying a 12-boiler package.
He asked if he could come into her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the cousin of Texas has overcome her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't follow my instincts back then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came to her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 present and former soldiers will be anxious to await the court's decisions at the historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether to go to the court for action against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The suit contends that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C. originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by employees and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top military because the problem is starting with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burke also said that about 400 other victims had contacted her since February, many of whom could participate in future requests.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, it will open many cases if it takes to maintain pressure.
A defence team from the Ministry of Defence, under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to put an end to the case.
The court documents that Newsweek received reveal a defence strategy, mainly consisting of the fact that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision of Doctrine Ferres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of plaintiffs”, the documents state.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on this history.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in the fight, the division is only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in the fighting zone.
Result: 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them fighting.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; three others are preparing in addition to her claim.
In the Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a juno-authentic atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, at which the diagnosis of “personal change” that victims of violence are subjected to in order to eliminate them from service is a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anna Bhagwati of the human rights group Organization of Action of Women Soldiers.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pensions from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate drafts offering a number of measures have been submitted to Congress by a panel of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported from the Ministry of Trafficking ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: 20 per cent of cases reported were brought to trial, twice as much as in the civil justice system in 2010.
The complainants in the Berk case call them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to give details of the rape to a female female police, doctor and commanders 11 times separately.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from the cut on her hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing asking her if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby." "I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "This wasn't a trial against him.
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable wording, which prevented her from obtaining any benefits.
If the matter brought forward by Lyman and her companions on the case is a complex question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward.”
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've always criticized Doctrine Ferres.
The army has stayed behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds: “The chances against them are high ... but it is important for them to try.”
These things only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
The walls have eyes: how researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Braywick was a regular guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braywick, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Brayvik could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy. We just need to get on Facebook.
“We realized that it was not difficult to get close to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on the European cyber-populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
Personal data stocks on Facebook are so great, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that they have been doing marketing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then advertised to them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertisement offered a user an interview on their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to request more than 10,000 members of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not so impressive: right-wing online groups are most often young men who are unhappy with immigration.
But suddenly “those who combine their online activities with off-line activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the website to explore everything in the world, from health to social trends, expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three day-to-day "super-actual information" Facebook is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles entitled "the site" by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who can't be approached on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join a party and they'd never have accepted you," Bartlett said.
"The Facebook disables all this -- you're talking to them directly."
Others say that social health problems could be identified and investigated through this site.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their resident teachers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who has too often updated drunk statuses.
“You cannot solve the problem without identifying it,” said Washington Post-Dmitry Christikis, co-sponsor of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children from a group of risks we wouldn't have found otherwise."
Facebook also continuously extracts data about its users.
The website ' s data processing team processed statistics on the status of relations and Valentine ' s Day, voter appearance in mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information available only to them) - cyber freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of publicly available data available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with someone thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for off-line research, online data are accessible.
“I don’t think many users thought at least that a researcher could monitor their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, of a study he conducted in 2006 using the students’ public pages on Facebook.
"As far as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology was then raised.
Even offline has no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is true in the profile and on the user page.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook is two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technological research, Selwyn thinks that the notebook and the pen are still the best research tools available.
“Nothing can change the way into real peace and communication with real people,” he said.
“Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still taking place off-line.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be the first public to appear before the court
Anders Bering Braywick, a man who confessed to the organization of a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of “resistance” during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of Templier Norway”, he delivered 500 in front of the court.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit it, but I don't admit it."
Judge Torquell Nesheim interrupted Braywick during this monologue because he "did not wish to give Breavik an opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breavik, who brought with him the written speech, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breavik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Bravika in the eyes, others to see that he was locked up.
Everyone has come to find the answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the Norwegian channel NRK, one of the survivors of Utaya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it became a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Bravik maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breavik's strange idea that he was part of the big resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not crazy, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with his accomplices.
Some may be relieved that attacks on July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much simpler if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can consider to be the greatest discovery in the newly discovered interview, which was mentioned in advance of the preliminary demonstrations in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also an affluent organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "the disease to think that a really big idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of artificial labor."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerves TV show about the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long interview.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had been working all over his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of mass Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals were missing in transport.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute Steve Jobs film: Lost Interview, which goes out to Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unusually ready to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different times during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers -- reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Jobs appears to be on the surface, where it seems to be the irritated issues of Kringley, which make it move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the Pixar era, the iPads and iPhones, there's something ominously prophetic when Jobs appreciates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of future information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' postmortem grades, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, a anxious dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things they could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail their attempts to rationalize Apple reporting.
A distraught way of recording the costs that often began with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then rushed by means of “definition”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs up to little.
A joke over the Pope:
Jobs tells us in detail about the blue box he mastered with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively break into the phone company and call at long distances free of charge.
There's been a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of authority is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been screaming in your phone car, and it's been a minute later in your neighbor's phone machine," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
You and I knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple could have ever come up without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous date with which he and Wozniak practically made the call to the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asked the Pope’s phone to do their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called out in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two laughed right before the pope was raised to answer the phone.
About infatuation in technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he found Bill Hewlett in a phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received summer repairs at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's staff who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic light tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager and go around that car and write programs for her.
Improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs interviewed about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting plates, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in credit, he had to plan both the assembly and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce disputes... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a 300-dollar mouse], and I was full of throat, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
Large energy-losing companies:
Long before he led the resurgence of Apple, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would fail to see the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually lead companies, and the people making the product are pushed off the decision-making site.
The genius of the product, which led to this monopoly position, is repulsed by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times as big, could be Microsoft '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
About innovation as a form of art:
"A great idea separates a great deal of artificial labor... when you open up a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't make do electronics, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in mind -- these concepts -- bringing them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste -- it's about trying to express itself in the best that people have ever done before, and then trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who worked for him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Scully and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is dealing with the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue, whether he would listen to the dismissal of President Obama's Health Act, his two judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, for a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states that challenged the rapid review of health, adopted by Congress last year, of a law that united conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the 5 1/2-hour rotating debate is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the judgement is announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Act should probably be abolished, Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General during the George W. Bush presidency.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor an annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the court meeting.
He attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate republicans and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The honorary guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federal Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were to comply, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which reads: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest or be referred to in the programme of such an event”.
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“It’s a staggering violation of ethics and indifference to the code contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules as apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges have been drinking and having dinner at the official fundraiser with the lawyers whose cases are now being tried in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scully and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a prominent conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Scully and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration, when the first judicial objections against the law were filed at the trial level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan give up the hearing in this case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do so.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion-dollar plane ticket
Emirates Air Force is ordering 50 wide-seat Boeing 777s and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft, and the price of all 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
It's just as important where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold of future airplane orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced on this weekend his largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft, 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft.
An incredible order came from an Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total pre-emptive price to $26 billion, Boeing said in 2011 at Aviasou Dubai.
Later on Monday, said Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can boast of significantly better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The pre-emptive cost of six aircraft will be over $1 billion.
"This is really very good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
“The quality of these specific buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for aircraft, but they also have an increase in fuel prices, which usually damages airlines, because it is one of their largest items of expenditure, is not so expensive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important, since they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the flight order when the prices rise, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates Order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market of broadband aircraft and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to take over his reign with his A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months after Airbus stated that he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competed just from 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded that the cargo capacity and distance of the flight be increased.
The Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexico President's sister apparently lost her election in Michoakan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug traffickers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo from the IP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have made her application for Governor Michoacán during the bitter elections of the State, and she stated on Monday that the drug traffickers had helped bring a race in favour of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader in the Western State Governor ' s race.
“Integrating organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday is alarming not only for Michoakan but also for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview the following day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our officers in the election... they caught the polls, put obstacles... and made people vote" for the IP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It is preparing a return, and victory in Michoakan is an important step in this effort.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have only a bit of a boost to Calderon, who led the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party or the GNI headed by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP now owned by the Governor's Chair, came in third - a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful lefts before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelja, denied contacts with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines dominated long - term.
It's President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections when he was aspiring for Louise, Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IP, however terrible as the elections in Michoakan look, victory will give a driving impulse to the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the IDP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nyeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valejo and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to helping to save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB Office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do all they can” to accelerate the restoration of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or the direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at the difficulties of Europe as “unscrupulous” and said that Asian financial assistance, side by side with European leadership and resources, could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We're all concerned."
“Anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he reported in an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European monetary union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowings have grown threateningly, and the prime ministers, both Italy and Greece, have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it can bring the world economy back to recession, and has prompted the leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like buying EU financial assistance bonds -- provided funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- gave great effect to the negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Trade Minister, said that “India will do its best” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have enormous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"That's not an option, that's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warsaw, professor at Brown University, U.S.A., said that it would be very difficult to provide political assistance to Europe for 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will know that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and travel to the sea for holidays, and it will not be well understood," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why Indian reserves should be used to contain Greek multiplicity and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, lost enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
The ADB forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lower risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop “emergency plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant capital flows from their economies.
Pentagon apprehensive warnings on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, has aggravated the situation on Monday at the Congress, warning that anticipated automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already faced with a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry”, Panette informed Senator John McCain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsay Graham, South Carolina, in a letter to Senators.
He said that the failure of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called Sequester had led to an overall 23 per cent reduction and the end of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will cause most of our shipbuilding and construction projects to fail -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and will cause serious damage to other attempts at modernization,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also have to fire many of our staff, and since the reduction will be done so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the state staff to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to the alert.”
The cuts will eventually affect the troops, Panetta said.
“Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the Secvet, military achievements will be seriously affected by major budget disruptions”, Panetta warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, which will result in the abolition of contracts and a treaty of oversight that supports troops.”
“Other staff will be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be breached.”
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The result of the Sequester in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power.”
“We stand firm against these dragon action”, the senators reported in a joint statement Monday night when they announced Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to. "
“The Sequestre is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta's letter or the senator's recent warnings would lead to a budgetary compromise or increase calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions, we shall see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House and aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a debilitating picture of what might happen next -- a shelled army without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"This plane's wing without enough trained pilots."
“This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"This is a force that suffers from an unstable combat spirit, a poor readiness and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"Actually, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he gave new details on how reductions “sustain significant operational risks: slowing down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously restricting our ability to be the first to be the first to be the first to react to the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground-based combat vehicle required by the Army and the Marine Corps to replace the Hammer.
The end of further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
A glimpse of the recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
Presidential candidate Herman Kane is involved in questioning allegations of sexual harassment against several women; each party is accusing the other of lying.
The Pennsylvania University administration was charged with false testimony because they allegedly hid that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was captured when he told US President Barack Obama, with his microphone on, that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York's congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying his departures, which was quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during an out-of-marriage campaign.
Again, no one living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about her sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during her second term in office.
History of school and college fraud is a common matter.
There have been times when teachers have given students answers to tests so that they can have a good evaluation of their performance.
Teachers who must teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
For one day, research shows that you may be lied to 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie of salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Lying or lying is a necessary skill for everyone for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike room games, such as charades, where to shout "Fun!", the identification of lies is a serious course of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of lies have been decommissioned.
Liars look in the eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, blush, or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of claims, mimics, the structure of questions and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviewing, negotiation or management.
Good liars can read others well, making them feel unrelenting, controlling them with their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women are about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than singles.
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your facility.
It's called "determining the baseline."
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of change further.
Watch the pose, laughter, voice features of your site.
It is good for you to know if a person keeps knocking on his feet in a normal way, then you will not make unjust accusations when you see a knock in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceitful verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Cheaters can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can set their feet towards the door, bend to the exit, change their pose in a certain way, or demonstrate “relief after interview” -- this exaggerated breath of relief and change of position when all the complex questions are in the back.
Investigators often falsify the call for an end to interrogation to simply look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to your subject's speech.
It is known that Scott Peterson has retreated and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Deceptive people can also use distance to say, "I've never had sex with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or to repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "training language" when they answer the difficult question, "Well... in truth... as far as I know... as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect lies, but you can master the skill to detect deception.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to be the victim of skilled bugs in professional and personal life.
The oil pipeline dispute plan needs to be revised after the US threat of delaying its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, causing the anger of trade unions but calming environmental defenders, the oil pipeline company claims that it would be willing to review the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sand hills in Nebraska and that the project would be approved.
The company made that decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, though with another route.
This is following a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone the project decision at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the Nebrasky and Ogalala sand hills, the vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to renegotiate the decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although the authorities denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal by the Department of State and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil factories in Texas.
In order to do that, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but they love trade unions that hope for about 20,000 jobs related to oil pipelines.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and the Aquifer Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current study by the State Department on environmental impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the audit of the Department had ordered a separate review of the procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, was a consultant in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate, since it was linked to TransCanada.
In Patty LaBell, she was tried for allegedly causing the child anxiety.
The New York family claims that the disco-divic Patty LaBell began to lurk in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their teenage daughter to the point that she was afraid.
Lady Marmalade's tirade scared her 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she passed on "personal change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," says her family at Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on 10 November last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her," she said.
LaBell had an angry excuse for a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to use mockery -- the word "C" and the word "F" -- in higher pitches...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a tantrum.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl cried so hard that she was disgusted, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note of apologies but received no reply.
Counsel and representatives of LaBell do not respond to the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to contribute any money they receive to the charity of children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patty LaBell to be held accountable for her actions," Davis said.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate challenges slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez' rule, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew in Sinaloa, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011 - which will be the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also called the Year of Change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the core indicators of economic development.
Not only did the low temperatures of February lead to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
835,582 hectares were injured, 78.03 per cent of which were affected in part, while the remaining 21.07 per cent were affected in part by vegetables, maize and nut.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters of the year, to an accelerated increase in unemployment rates, from January to March 55.053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, to 5,28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September, to 6.19 per cent, a percentage of more than 74,000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 compared to the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is characterized by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions undertaken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which relates to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market, with a view to limiting the resources imposed by law, which was adopted at Congress to combat money-laundering, as it is not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
López Cervantes said there was a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been limited, primarily because of the difficulties with entry, and in the second, because once they have entered, they already face very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remains and requires jobs here in the state, as a result of rising unemployment”, he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa's labour market is worse if the large number of labour-related violations, according to INEGI, accounts for 60.38 per cent of the active population in the state, are not mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities, another reminder of the state ' s work is presented by low wages; in the state, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Welfare and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630.697 from January to July. This represents a fall of 87.74 per cent compared with $5.143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly came to companies from the services sector.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the State government asked the state Congress in July for a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any state economy until November.
Responses
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrates the lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Processing, said that there was a lack of agreement between the various sectors, including the State Government itself, during 2011.
“The economic efficiency in Sinaloa has been indeed low this year, there has been a great deal of work to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012, we must redouble our efforts, we have not been able to reconcile the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Deceleration of the economy
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes this year have stopped the state economy and its effectiveness and growth has been limited.
"The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of the route
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme must be developed that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, and all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various fields, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme”, he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own policy direction.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to engage in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done,” he said.
He is sentenced to eight pounds [8 kg] of marijuana
Five years in prison and a 100-day income fine, such a sentence was imposed on the citizen of Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General reported that Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, a convicted drug dealer convicted of a crime against health, in this case kept marijuana for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrols on the street of Cipriano Valdez, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
A drug dealer was behind a white car truck in which he was carrying a black bag in his car and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the removal was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be imprisoned at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work should be made
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of staying unfinished or delayed due to a lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while work programmes had been under way, they were at risk because the State Government was unable to make contributions that amounted to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to about 50 million pesos, of which the state should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality were providing resources for work, so it is still possible to delay their completion.
"They must invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they did not give us a penny when they were supposed to give us part of it from the beginning of July," he said, "to not delay, we started work and they moved very much, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that it was supposed to make, so that at the beginning of the municipal administration, it had to take the money to cover more than 7 million dollars, the amount that had not been paid by the administration of the State.
“This has happened to us in the previous administration because the state has no financial capacity to participate and the programmes have continued to develop, and this year, in order to access these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains to be covered by the state,” he explained.
While the State authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts to ensure that the interest pertaining to them would come as quickly as possible.
"They have to make almost 12 million dollars, and even though the year ends, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the “Transition to Digital Television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals to digital is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (CJ) dismissed the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which conveys the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not collected for cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims filed by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of the eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law established by law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coffet), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Marguerite Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project ' s arguments in the sense that the federal executive power could not determine the general rules of the measures to be taken by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that if this had happened, it would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulatory authority” and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, had a bearing on the federal executive authority, which had a constitutional mandate, was the management of the State.
Replacing analog signals to digital - one of the most important changes in recent years - has led to better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting the public needs, which have not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “should be the work of the entire system established in the principle of public economic governance, including a group of authorities which the Constitution unites in the State executive power”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed their digital broadcasting and had done so through the Executive, despite the existence of narrow-minded technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting a decree under discussion which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, ensures compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoakan, the possibility of counting “voice” is analysed.
According to data transferred to ERW, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “vote vote” is real with regard to the election process this year in Michoakan, where according to data from the Programme of Preliminary Election Results (PERP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6,074 minutes.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections, Michoacán (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the constituency approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It is recalled that Michoakan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, because the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame set out in the law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JCC) ruled on a constitutional claim made by the local legislative assembly and called the “ineffective and illegal” vote of the State representative on constitutional reform because he did not have the right to “authorize or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “vote vote”, Maria de los Anheles Landeral argued that the adoption of appropriate principles by the ICM General Council would make it possible to submit a partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial conversion of one or more ballots may be made under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no vote and counting of documents in the urn or it is not in the Chair's possession; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a general recalculation in all ballots in the elections may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate of the elections under consideration and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or the coalition that issued the second of the candidates.
A general recalculation would also be made if, at the end of the usual calculation, it was established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took second place was less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there was a request from the political party whose candidate took second place in the event that the ballots that were taken into account were deleted at partial recalculations.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morelia, where according to ERW, only 0.16 per cent between the first and the second places, not including 129 votes out of a total of 923.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on a Sunday evening; on Monday there was an inspection and restful Mass.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel’s last wish was to be dispersed in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After receiving condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coaouila on board the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attending the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the colonel’s ashes arrived at the time station at Nazario Ortis García Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school and football team, who was a member of Felipe Bassio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes spread in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortés Bassio, pilot's sister, reported.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the point of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to the Air College in Sapapán, Khalisko.
Some didn't believe him, they said he had a head in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bassio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The boy remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to attend the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying.
He's being held for the last time.
Shots fired at the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres Lópes, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technical High School, where he studied in 1985 and made progress in both his studies and his sport, held him for the last time.
Bassio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he operated suffered a collapse, along with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Moroy, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés (cremated), the resident of Saltillo, came to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to the training school, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teacher.
Three bodies found abandoned on the farm of NL Kaderite
Eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for organized crime crimes were shown in the media hours before the military was discovered.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was discovered at a mile (1.5 km) of Kadereit highway towards Santiago, on a height in a commune known as El Castillo.
A number of people who passed by noticed that a village house with a wall carved in a beige and brown, the gate was open.
When they looked inside, literally three metres away, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and another man was with him in a white shirt.
Almost one metre was the body of another man, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, since there were no shell casings.
There are signs of one organized criminal group of another in the village house, and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 captured in Caderium
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereit, who were accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and clandestine burials.
According to published information, eight people were detained at the Los Alvero colony on 11 November and one person was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone calling for members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., military personnel patrolling the village of Old Rancho in Caderite when he saw a car without license plates with two men in a salon.
After stopping them and conducting inspections, the military found rifles, ammunition, and 18 rounds.
Later, after those statements, at 14:00 on 13 November, one of their accomplices was stopped in the public land of La Pravda, who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with covert burials in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hen, and Caderite.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that has put that country at the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of an economic catastrophe and the damage to the euro area as a whole.
The presidential palace statement stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take office.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reiterate my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period”, the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"Structure is well outlined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a Government in less than three days, much less ordinary, as Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner of Monti, should adopt the package of hard savings required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
At the heart of the pressure on Monti to hurry, unstable markets have set the income of 10 years higher than 7 per cent of the GDP of Italy, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegaly, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, informed reporters after meeting with Monty: “We said we would actively support this Government.”
We believe that this is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the Silvio Berlusconi LDP party, which was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty must lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party's centre-law.
Support for the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of hard economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks stepped up pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meetings Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy's debts had now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next 2013 elections, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like politicians to be included in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only by technical experts, showing their dissatisfaction with the impact of the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
Hispanics have more gaming experience than Tikos.
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, ten had already played 50 international matches.
Only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches on Costa Rica ' s side.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, if you compare 22 players caused by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a full list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only Michael Umana's defender as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandes Stadium.
Spanish football players who played in the League of All Stars and the strong British Premier League clubs were very active in the league and local Cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in European Cups and Champions League.
In addition, Spanish Fury's experience in complex qualifications in the Euro or World Cup should be added.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered the lowest in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish holicypter Iker Cassillas, who last Sunday against England (the match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the ex-golicoper Andona Subizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassillas will play Tricholor today and set a new record in 127 international Spanish matches.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona's player, 106 matches.
Cassillas and Javi were found to be the best in the last week of the UEFA, along with another player of the Iberian team, Subizarreta, with 126 matches and bomber Shalk Raul González with 102.
It's almost nearly a hundred Charles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa with Sergio Ramos with 81, Andres Iñesta with 62, Sesk Fabregas with 61, and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, near Michael Umana, left side of Hunior Dias with 48 matches and bomber Brian Ruis, with 45.
Next, only five were able to cross the border in 30 games: Keylor Navas from 31, Randall Asphaifa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36, and José Luis Lopez from 35.
The others.
More than 30 matches in Spain by Gerard Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
With less than 30 exits in the field, there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The remaining ones didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreles only has four, and Horde Alba has two, in Costa Rica only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain’s leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour of the twentieth century career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group said that it was ready to give one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said it was also a dream, a reality, to play in that country.
This was the claim of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave exclusive interviews to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America on a tour of twenty years of work and on Sunday, 20, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be performing at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Robertas.
It's a fragment of a conversation whose full decryption is available online at The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and everything's going well.
I've only been in Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking this because there's some commitment to the group; the fans live in tension the day before the concert.
What will you tell your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope it's brought us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to do surfing and jungle work on these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have many surfers, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, and it's great surfing places, and that's how we found out, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you did a grand show with lots of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make a better show out of all kinds of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play over 120 songs, and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us down and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
You've seen 20 years of careers on this tour.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think none of us could have imagined that we'd be in a rock band and that what we've been doing for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our successes, and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We are happy to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things are going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flowering of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this great group.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from one city to another, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with them all and we're honored to be part of the Seattle sound that happened.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer in itself than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends, and as a result, musical roads have also been opened that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything couldn't be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy; but your success has made you able to do everything you wanted.
How do you balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We care not to be on tour too long because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it's done without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, what none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't released a single album until Andy's death.
It was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and soccer and a lot of friends.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
Local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yes, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that we liked more than anything else, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas can offer lively ones, and that should be very exciting.
Why do you always change words at Yellow Ledbetter concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he uses the first thing that comes into his head.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
So many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entwisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the border, even though it was no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little bit off from the word grand.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone who showed up at the same time, and if it's important right now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are now creating music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
That's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think that when you're growing up and there's some kind of trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was reinstated for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a public hospital, for a examination of the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor reported.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which resulted in four operations and was monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be screened in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said he felt that Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations to cancer of the tongue, lost 18 pounds [18 kg] to which other diseases, such as severe erosion gastritis, cysts of the stomach gland, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and problems with leg circulation, was listed by the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 men by the army destruction squad, who acted secretly in the first years of his reign.
Fly to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by Uruguay President José Muhika and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the region's political problems.
Muchika will meet with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, next Wednesday, the most important item of an extensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a timetable issued by the leadership of Uruguay.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will be “beneficial for the exchange of information on the political relationship between the two nations”, as the leadership of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which happened when French President Nikola Sarkozy included the South American country in a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canne.
Sarkozy ' s speech threatened to exclude those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that sparked Uruguay ' s protest and a call for consultations by his ambassador in a European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country on the exchange of tax information since January of this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to expedite the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements in order to leave this “serious list” of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not enjoy international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, since 2004, Mexico and Uruguay have had a free trade agreement (FTA), which has increased the trade between the two countries.
The succulent plumber will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Dude from the evil laps of Bouzer, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he's going to fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without having to use points.
“Mario is a hero who has to report on how stereoscopicity will work without points,” said the head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during a presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first video game of Nintendo specially developed under this platform" because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is a “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land has two games in one: the first part is simple to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “round the second round” to levels of games that are more complex this time.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between D aggressive or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which it is necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various obstacles and “not succumb to optical illusions”.
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, and the waterman with the ears needs to pass on dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Pic.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the “playing” Luigi.
Round guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo's extradition process had begun to respond to the U.S. for a $70 million laundering conspiracy.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive authorities, given that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He argued that during his mandate, he did not “place his hands” in legal decisions and take all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrocín, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for the sale of drugs.
What was done by Colom showed the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts had exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJ), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
Portillo was found innocent by the loss of Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove’s social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
In addition, hundreds of jobs created for the social group should be added.
The anniversary was the occasion for the outcome of a ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove appeared near Trinity Velya in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of employment and problems with drugs or marginalization.
Last night's celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that worked with the association during the 25 years.
The different political presentation during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the General Assembly, Arthur Masa and his predecessor, Horde Puhl, an ex-consulter of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and ex-Lattenant Mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council of Rickard Goma, attended the ceremony.
He also appeared at Fabra I Coats, the current social well-being and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris and CEO of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove came into light at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but he added that the work done so far is “becomes a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of combating bad circumstances and insurrectioning hope in people who have difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and work done to it," he said.
Grabbed building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on the street of Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in House 51 along the Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass gatherings that annoyed the neighbors, by decision of the court without police interference.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a checkpoint," said the manager.
The squatters who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of them inhabited, took all the electricity and parts of the water, painted the walls, and left traces of various kinds, especially of alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a playground for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80 per cent.
Club owner says that the hijackers dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros while at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to noise complaints from neighbors, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the inhabitants of the square and, above all, by those who attended the parties which were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbours said.
The club's owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner, and for nine months now, as he "forgave" her rent.
City police have also confirmed that more complaints have been received from neighbours in recent weeks.
The PP Municipal Group Chairman, Counsellor Alberto Fernand Dias, demanded that last week “immediately evacuate the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen from neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that by summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the past few months, squatters had invaded all the floors and virtually every room and that some of them had broken into.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture created in the building.”
So yesterday the police evacuated the building in Noa Barris.
At 3:30 a.m., police drove to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
A park or a mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a post-commitment competition
16-door municipal competition resumes debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinguished Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCR), the administration printed promotional sheets for Kolserola.
The bouquet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona’s capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took place in the consciousness of many as Barcelona’s highest point as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that were not headed north-south, but up (mountain) down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yoga’s bear.
This was so until, in September, the Council announced a huge competition, consisting of 16 competitions for many other doors in Kolserol.
The idea of the park is clearly under the gates.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is: Kolserola, park or mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this tribe of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And this fact is one of the few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona say and scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: competition appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss “the front of the mountain”, when the offer of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its excellent accessibility.
Kolserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the heading “Colserola Gate” contains the word trap: we should not think of them as “the entrance of the park, but as a limitation of some areas where we must act”.
Modolo, such as Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of forecasting the public space” following the 1980s experience, which ended at the Forum site with its swan song.
The first fear is the very limit of where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," means the transition.
“We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [General Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to that, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calserola, which is “not worth passing through the ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity the mayor offers his profession to join the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter into a debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is something that should lead interdisciplinary teams (“success”), which he claims should have created: “The architects should be only a tool”.
Byiona suggests that the answer to the question posed by the title of this part is complex, because the competition rules lack the common form of Colserola: "There have been 16 competing competitions announced," he said, in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longer reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes, at least in his case, 16 competitions possible.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can cross the programme and design with the project of the architect for the adjacent gate.
From your point of view, the Council must ensure that the lane is directly above Rhonda de Dahlt and must provide in its entirety an area equipped for a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, Judge Red Casino pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legitimate representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing, Casino Royale, owned by Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution so that the Monterrey authorities could authorize a secret operation in the gaming house.
After a public conviction, the Attorney General opened a criminal case against the Mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the Ministry of State for Succession Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the State capital.
He remained there for 49 days following the instructions of the second movement ban order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereit for allegedly extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigation, Jonas's guilt was sufficiently evident, such as the charging of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legitimate representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gomez, presented Judge José Luis Pesina to ask pardons for the mayor ' s brother in the region, so that in the coming hours he could be freed.
During the trial, the Attorney General of the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated and who of the partners of the gambling house was pardoning, although counsel tried not to make a name.
On the basis of the records of 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabal was granted a legal pardon, and after that no statements could be made concerning the process planned against him; nor would any reparation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
A court official, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicolas municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by a judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakomé describes the details of the disaster in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others died, showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in complete integrity without the pilot trying to land an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the ship had several contact with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees 25 metres away, where the vehicle lost the fluise."
It also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the human transport requirements.
He also said that the research carried out in the area of impact did not indicate that there were parts on the ground.
“The study reported that there were no other parts of the vessel, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements of passenger transport.
The land in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the crash, the Presidential helicopter was driven to cruise speeds and that this had occurred on a soft lifting ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hakomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, which means that the team must have visibility during flight and landing.
Conditional conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower altitude and greater visibility in the Quernawak Valley.
The place is hitting.
The impact coordinates and the latest records from the aircraft radar are likely to coincide with no loss of control or change of flight before impact.
Dispersion of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
Fragmentation suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
Untraceable evidence remains in the disaster zone in the wreckage of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there could be multiple contacts with the land.
During work on the ground, pieces of an aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
Pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in a larger territory than the area described near the disaster site, the scattered parts of the aircraft were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces Genoa Obesity Search Program
Social protection is headed by a study to find the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by experts from IPN
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to identify the gene of obesity in children and young people, which was called the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents” protocol, which would provide a calculation of signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and postgraduates of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Technology (NPI).
In the study, the population (written or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where tests with children will be conducted each Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be conducted at a sports centre in Quutemoke, in the west of Mexico City, and since 8 October, events had taken place at a sports centre in Nsoualkootla (East of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the component and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal will be to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 from parental leave and under their supervision to complete individual questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that Saturday would take anthropometric measurements of all participants (height, height and waist), blood pressure measurement and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only 6 years of growth occurred: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent for girls; in excess of weight, there was also significant growth," said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, a Mexican is a 65% descendant of American Indians, a 30% descendant of Europeans and a five per cent descendant of Africans, and this condition affected genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly due to obesity genetics, the body's inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and is delayed as fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit to participants, which could determine whether they had any degree of weight or obesity.
Even he said that there were dark folds on the neck (acons) and forearms, which would mean that the metabolism and even the prediabetes would be broken.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, and the doctor transmits it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting life, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of a TV set, and using transport at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (paints, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and genetic predisposition as analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, environmentally sound and temperature-resistant.
If traffic signals were to be addressed, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 dams for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a UNAM chemical researcher, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalted road surfaces is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or reduced to zero.
His lecture on the technological view of pits read in the International Year of Chemistry said that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer modified bitumen for producing a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, like in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to resist the formation of caves.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbons molecules, some of which are the high molecular mass called asphalt, and others are the low molecular mass referred to as molecules, which together give the road covering its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The marital behaviour of bitumen is the fact that it behaves like liquid at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, at 120 °C, and at 50 °C, it retains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said the chemical engineering specialist.
The scientist observed that the streets of Mexico were largely covered with flexible coatings, made up of six layers of material, three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones left in bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that was made up of this coating, he said, was buried in a bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting effort, this helps the forces to distribute very well on the road.
If it were modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt floor, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of wear made from a small stone, is actually sand immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the layer of wear also requires adequate thickness, and the material from which it is made should be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature dropovers, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the earth is wet, the water penetrates the surface and is difficult to get out of, this causes all the layers of the roof to grow soft and therefore the formation of the caves.
In the formation of the pits, he said that the first one was a layer of wear, and only then did it affect the bitumen, but the damage did not take place immediately, which should be considered in the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System explained that the transport burden is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each surface layer must always be linked to the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent frequent pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still much to be done about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to make pits easily and without high temperatures.
What did Vale's candidate lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Meline Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only been left to seek the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied with the rise of the winners with the silver crown and the ribbon proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
Based on the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and skipper, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of the women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvares (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sunsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hyseye Alhur Garels (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Alhuré (2008).
The question many are now asking:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each speech has shown that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, she was not simply elected the Queen of Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles owned by the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?” asked Martin Murilla Gomez of literary society.
She replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of cultivation, and I certainly think that a book describing my childhood, the Little Prince, is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading "Crime and Punishment", a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirov, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Fire."
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted describes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and content with her result: "University wisdom happens what must happen."
And all of you, please read a little bit, "Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the sounding hypotheses, Valé burned out of favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, since she had been preferred, she was an ovation candidate who had received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, a visual vote for the best national costume, and the Queen's Mother), “which aroused the zeal of other candidates, provoked stress from the Queen, and as the consequence she did not shine on the stage”.
This was noted during her first appearance at the beach bath on Hilton and during two of her performances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at home on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become queen"
Moreover, the representative of Valle had recently avoided press relations, and that was not the case.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election of Lucy Doti, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the outside, but also at the public awareness before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also assumed that the representative of Valle was wrong about the berries and fibrosis that was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
King Ernan Orosco, counsellor, notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but the problems of stomach fibrosis, which were not very noticeable to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake made by the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was surgically involved.
"Operations are good, but Representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and she was punished here.
As for the prize, which was first served by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the harsh prediction came true last night, it was said that it was the child that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for her lack of pleasure in obtaining the crown.
Whether this is the case or not, the fact that today Melina has a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly identified by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will go back to history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena Competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
The criminalist from Kali has made history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Kano.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali's criminalist made history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
This week, seven CTI forensics were assigned to call Elizar González, a man from Puerto Texas who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and, following the course, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin training, i.e., ice cream and rocks.
During the week of Elisar's identification operation known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days of clothing.
Something big came up.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Kauca to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he arrived with the research group at the location of the body, he did not identify it in its external form; it was very different from the one displayed in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, with no eyes on, and much worse.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elisar compared the body’s fingerprints to those in the photographs.
His eyes didn't let him down: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the FARC.
Fingerprint Search
For a dactyloscopy specialist, Sijin, from Kali, recognized by President Juan Manuel Santos Elisar González at a press conference on the operation against Kano, is particularly important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a strict science, without error, which can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, dactyloscopy experts are involved in investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and identify detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them at the base.
The researcher said that in the event of a theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home because the thief was hand-in-hand to master a safe, full of jewels and money.
"With walls it's hard to work because they're not comfortable surfaces to print, but in this case we can take photos of the whole lot and identify the offender who took part in several thefts," he said.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles of liquor around him.
During the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of committing a crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle were identical.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the murder scene.
A CTI dactyloscopic specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent was applied in places where fingerprints were found.
When shown, the blade or tape is used to remove them.
The fingerprints are then sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered on the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV programme.
Just like all that gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves prints on it.
However, if possible, comparisons shall be made.
Angry People challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke up a camp outside Zukotti Square.
Some protestors listened to the court's decision to launch a demonstration from the square and went to a park near the neighborhood.
Members of the Wall Street Movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to infiltrate again, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go because of a court order that allowed "distorted people" to break down a camp in the square while the other part of the movement responded to the raid by taking over a park in the north of the city where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to break up the camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the representatives of the Wall Street Movement.
Brey explained that the response of the “distorted people” to the evacuation of the tentacles town, ordered by mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York personally, was brought to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, angry people began to seize a new park, located on the merger site of the central streets of Channel Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to Holland's tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the arrival of the Church of Troitsa.
At least for an hour they could occupy this place, but then the police arrived and began to arrest some of the protesters, although Brey could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The Organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement by trying to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the area of Zukotti, which is private ownership, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will address the legality of the morning protestors ' debate.
Some of the protestors who went there carried copies of the court order and even gave copies to the police guarding the area, which resulted in “some small clashes”, Bray said, who said that some policemen had been protestors.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street Movement and forcing them to enforce “the laws issued after the seizure or to prohibit demonstrators from regaining access to the park with shops and other property previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that as a result of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of the public space, and demonstrators were informed about this, but local laws did not allow them to reopen tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protestors from Zukotti Square, carried out at dawn, an operation during which about 200 arrests were carried out, and that was decided because the protesters “broked the law”.
Bloomberg said that he ordered the area to be cleaned because it was "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people" because "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors feared "the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning has been repulsive and shows that in the depths of Bloomberg's soul, there is more interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for “no respect for freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Initiative also indicated that they intend to organize “great action” on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is going to be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, it will appear in the television program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on 1 December.
Canada's Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at the "Big Repair", a lifeguard at Malibu Rescuers, Bunny at Playboy, wife of Tommy Lee's rock musician, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a crowner (ballad) Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, would appear on TV on December 1st "The Birth of Russell Peters" as a very special Mary.
The CTV today presented the footage of a television show, in which Anderson, also known for a widely distributed Internet pornographic video, shows her and her husband, the drummer of the "Mötley Crüe" group, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, in a manger doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently led My Cruel Torpedo of Truth, Charlie Shina, appeared as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special CTV Christmas show features a Canadian singer named Bubble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March to the Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato, who also knows the talk of scandals.
Recently, Beeble called the American bitch Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Restored After the Earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe that has been borne by the rising sun from World War II
According to the Tokyo Government’s first estimate, material losses amounted to $300,000, a blow that seems to be taking place despite the plight of the world.
After three lost neighbourhoods, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped to reverse the page: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The financial year for Japanese registered in the second quarter begins in March 2012 and also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Recovery may partly be due to the resurgence of the purchase of machine equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs experienced from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real break in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan was awakened mainly by the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This figure increased by 1% as a result of increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
Climaxian yen
Tokyo provided an internal market when yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the currency-refugees chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that pushes, like a rock, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame yen for their low performances from July to September.
While markets continue to be besieged by EU peripheral countries, the Government of Eshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
We must be careful about the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the dramatic rise in the value of yen, Motohis Furukawa, Minister of Economic Policy said yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had shown clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the collapses in the world economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
He then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after falling eight tenths to 99.13.
Athens Again Give Land to Doubts
Papademos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the periphery premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze leading to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “conclusion” of the new Transitional Government of Ellada is being imposed on Brussels rather than on the true conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their implementation, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, believes that he will not support new measures of strict savings in any event and has reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, Papademos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will culminate tomorrow in the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify the doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives made one step more in his sentiments about the EU and IMF, organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not give his approval of any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, while still experiencing the irritation of the effect caused by Papandreou's claim in style or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid unless the new Government and leaders of Greece's main parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new Government, “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
There's plenty of thread in the Greek tangle for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain ' s “core” position with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that, in the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose “existence”, she said, was that it was “a tool for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “excellently necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with the aim of halving the number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is marked”.
Spain is still working to expand the network of recipients around the world and assumes this task with full “responsibility”, says Dona Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “provide the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women, the “main recipients of these loans”.
There are many achievements here and many difficulties that we face.
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty has thus explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will be able to recover from the poverty they are engulfed in.
The momentum for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and in the rest of the world “went on the road that started years ago” by Muhammad Yunus emphasized Ms. Sofia as “a act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “a striking idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was adopted a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continued development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project was presented to her yesterday as the title “head of the family” gathered in Valladolid by the Banker of the Poor.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her statement by urging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenes said that solidarity is a “ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it was “a permanent obligation”.
Hymenez concluded that microcredit entails “a serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” developed-country Governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
Microcredit for Spain is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the “successful” to give “certitude” to the people “to whom all the doors are closed” and the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, who “opens his doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
HDZ proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe has not been originally planned in the programme, but it has arisen in the autumn itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today in relation to Greece and perhaps tomorrow to Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which was put to the discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained from voting.
The ovations, which lasted several minutes, which earned Angel Merkel's statements and several hours later Wolfgang Schäible, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
It's time for the chancellor to break into Europe.
This may mean changes in the Treaty of Lisbon which make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policy of the Eurozone countries, but this may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote “to give Europe a person”.
In any event, it is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which is apparently owned by Wolfgang Schäible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK opposes it, and the leaders of the HDZ believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates by overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member of the European Union in the direction of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kola, but she did not seek to influence the Congress through “small” European countries or countries in difficult situations who like to criticize “high-sized” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe highlights the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just in the middle.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became a bloodbath scene.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What is hospitalized fraud?
After cash benefits, the UMP and the Government launched an attack on hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Allowance Fund and to address the issue periodically raised since 2007 to combat fraud in the field of social benefits.
And in order to help this attack, which has arisen from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right-wing campaign to re-election, most want to focus on hospital lists.
First of all, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer ' s special consent, the sick employee loses four days ' wages equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose on public servants one day without the payment of sickness benefit (state employees have not yet had to wait for the benefit, unlike the three-day wait of private sector employees).
Now that these issues are under discussion, most also once again raise the topic of fraud in view of the abuse of hospital papers.
Control will be tougher and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to pay back all your payments illegally," Xavier Bertrand warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leaves.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant control and political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation, the daily compensation costs of 11.3,000 million euros in 2008 amounted to 5% of total health expenditure.
Out of this amount, 46 per cent were on maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent were on sickness benefits, amounting to Euro6.2 million.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 on a hospital basis, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic average, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management website showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any hospital day.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010, 37 per cent of the hospital population lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
Comparing these figures with the figures of European neighbours shows that French workers are no more inclined to take hospital treatment than any other country ' s employees.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
Hospital leaf fraud rates are very low compared to "serious" employment.
As far as the level of fraud is concerned, it is very low.
The increase in the law since 2002 has led to a systematic hospital check of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of the 1.5 million proven cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term disease conclusions were “unjustifiable” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets, more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unreasonable”, or 132 000.
In general, 169 000 cases were “unjustified” for several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the numbers "serve" of employment.
According to the MP of Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between 9 and 15,000 million euros of unreceipted budget income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore indefinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated in Parliament, adding that 100 days had not been sufficient for the coalition Government to carry out that task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme”, said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on confidence-building in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, as the “mapping” of the country's presence in the Eurozone, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit of “approximately 9%” from GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rightful Reject the Action of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, a right-wing leader, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to recover from the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with deputies from his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing deficits and debt and combating warehousing, but also with the rejection of any course that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehnu, European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, said Antonio Samaras that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, as stated by the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied death, confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative assistance, and this is not a case of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code to allow suicide with foreign assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to argue on the subject of death”.
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6 per cent of them end up dead in a hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is an abuse of use, i.e. the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance to people who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who submitted the report, confirmed during the teleconference that most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign assistance is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to angus reyd's 2010 survey, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code must establish that a legally reasonable cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of care at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it does not serve to dull physical pain, such as euthanasia, and be subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Meter Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the “extremeness” of experts who signed the report as not, among other things, limiting the use of euthanasia by fatalities.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says Deshan, the mayor who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Meter Descham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that constitute social fabric of society.
He said, "there are warning signs and bans in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “the categorical opposition to the findings of the report, which she called a “manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, has challenged, among other things, the reports on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to surrender his power
Damascus condemns “conspiracy”
Syria Is Getting More Insulated
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bashar Assad's Syria increased, which, with Russian support, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after Syrian membership in the League of Arab States was suspended, the European Union strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan called for the resignation of President Assad.
The king of Jordan, Abdalla II, became the first Arab leader yesterday, who called on President Bashar Assad to take power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the regime were killed.
“If Bashar had the cost of his country’s interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the King of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and who cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, implying Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly stricter course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “strengthening consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s actions” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course towards the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have died in the region of Dera in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the firefight and the heavy gunfire in Jobara in the city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During the press conference, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was “a dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this conspiracy against Syria would fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria from the League of Arab States, it is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the embezzlement of 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, Journalists and Military Observers.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also advocated sending observers to the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, called yesterday the “uncorrected” decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a crisis exit plan, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from the markets and victims of Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked markets for a little time to form his team and implement a programme that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucar, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Finney, said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty's introduction of a limited list of dozens or some of the ministers of the country of George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understood”.
His appointment as president was initially endorsed by markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the sudden fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wished to include “politicians”.
The new Government would have to act before 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to Speaker Gianfranco Finney of the Chamber of Deputies, the new Government will receive the confidence of parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Olli Rehn, stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss of Emma Marchegaly, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth is unable to meet the deficit.”
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as a member of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “the other Italy”, according to the authors of the projects.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid early elections, as Italy is expected to make payments of EUR 200,000 by April 2012.
Russian scientist assisted Iran's nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vjeceslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-grade detonator, the United States Agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is building on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN agency documents to identify this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “from the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company producing nano diamonds in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA referred to “clear indications that Iran’s development” of the nuclear detonator system “has enabled the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the Agency that he has worked much of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of his own country”.
Anti-Muslim crime increased by 50 per cent
According to statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence were slightly reduced or unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing a 49 per cent increase, compared with 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks on Jews and a 14 per cent increase in the number of crimes on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
Following the decline in 2009, the number of these crimes is rising again, stresses Human Rights First, “increasing violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious human rights violations," added one of the leaders of Paul Lelandre.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
"Hate-based crimes" in federal law are the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence involving race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, a microblog site Twitter changed the presentation of its platform, which will allow users to see, inter alia, the activity of those they watch, which makes this service look like Facebook.
The new “activities” tab and the other “name” allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, internet users whose messages you track, and those who track yours.
This allows you to know if they publish messages if they sign on to new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested “at a small percentage of users in August” before reaching the public on Monday, AFP announced a press release to Twitter by Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively vague and as using rather vague terms (RT for the outpost of someone else's communication, #followfriday for the recommendation of tracking other users), mainly by giving pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to the wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
Online users discussed this innovation with tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, superfluous, and it's too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of the “Golden Rule” of the budget into the Constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “golden rule” into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible declines in Austria's credit rating agencies (three A).
Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faimann personally announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian State debt being 74.6 per cent, much higher than the upper threshold of the rule of 60% established by the Maastricht Treaty but lower than the government debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay a percentage of three thousand euros more each year, the Deputy Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats, Michael Spindelegger, cited.
Austria therefore fulfils the Eurozone Summit requirement on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government have demanded a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt the “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP, and land, like municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the public debt go down below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshihiko Noda
threatens new foreign exchange intervention
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would undertake new foreign exchange interventions if the cost of yen continued to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of yen, Mr. Noda Senatu explained.
On Tuesday, yen grew almost to the historic point, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars largely to reduce the cost of the Japanese currency, which established a new record of force since 1945.
Since then, however, yen has been growing constantly, driven by purchases of investors, who view it as a “refugee” in these sad times of economic downturn around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plan in 105 yen, close to the level which triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted to national currency.
“Japan is fighting to restore itself” after the 11 March earthquake and the 11th tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda stressed, who was afraid that this growth would kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The third largest economic Power in the world has resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic performance”.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken yen.
But the Deputy Managing Authority of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “relevant steps” to realize that no additional mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the broadcasting organization increased by 5,000 million yen (EUR 47,000) to purchase treasury bonds, raising up to 55,000 million yen (€519,000) to the ceilings that it spends on buying various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates rising, stock exchanges fluctuating
The risk of debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further to the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m. CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and completed the bidding at 3,064 points.
DAX fell 0.4% in Frankfurt and London 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in lending to euro area countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“The concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets’ institutional broker quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market participants ' doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has pursued its view of Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsuige Akino, Fund Manager at Ichioshi Investment Management
This return of concern for the future of the eurozone is on a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its bottom mark in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, dropping 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party on Monday, which adopted a resolution, which included an opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italy ' s 10-year bond yield reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity.
These difficulties, with interest rates in the southern countries but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked for the exchange of time to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the “core task” of his Government.
Spain was shot at in front of the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
A new historical maximum was reached between the interest rates for the 10-year debt commitments of Germany and Spain.
Waiting for growth figures in Eurozone
France recorded economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, owing to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, reviewed the decline in the figure of the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded a 0.5 per cent increase during the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m. and the European Commission is warning of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after a short discussion or with the effects of emotion, it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason to reflect on the share and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should base its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the electricity demand by 2050 unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue the production of electricity on a continuous basis, while not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case with Belgium, which depends on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are only a few who are strongly continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one unit to its set by renewing the construction of the station that was interrupted after the crash in Tri-Mail Island.
Although the renewable energy model of Germany is sometimes cited as an example, the validity is contrary to this argument.
Berlin's choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, of carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's turbine champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest coal and gas consumer due to the break-up wind; therefore, carbon dioxide and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than in Europe on average.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than the French households.
Because in a globalized economy, energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and in the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a great increase in the cost of electricity, which will illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create a industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Highly export-oriented, it attracts an entire breed of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if its manufacturer was scheduled to close?
To resolve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mail Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental implications
In Chernobyl, the structure of the reactor and the unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that an accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it has drawn from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German constructors, EPR, is a project to combat such phenomena.
Since it is being considered by all energy experts who wish to build a reactor, stopping it in Flamenville will be a great gift to the competitors Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to conquer leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is also legitimate to seek the best combination of sources of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogma and biases to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate figures policies and the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which occurred in the news, when the Minister of the Interior (Liberasion of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and left are very agreeable on this issue.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac was asked, who in 1976 stated that “9,000,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left hand side, Michel Rokar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world”.
Difference only in the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invading the territory of the country was felt by the left and right hordes of the Polish plumber.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will allow for immigrants to be shown.
In his programme, François Alland was limited to banality, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an elective advantage, but it is cost-effective.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us, in a recent book on immigration (Personal People: How Migration Created Our World and Determines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that adopt immigrants.
The reduction of immigration has led to a decrease in growth and a decrease in employment.
Fears of the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by triggering wage cuts.
But experience has shown that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than replacing local labour by performing work for which local labour is lacking.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour but are most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complement between local and immigrant workers has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that the increase of 1% of the migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This is not the case with the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the United States Nobel Prize winners a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all based on immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, giving on average 1% of the general budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant who has arrived at the age of 30 in Germany will bring a net profit (income minus expenditure) to the State budget on average 150,000 euros.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to be entangled in the lack of growth.
These teeth, which were used to intimidate immigrants, have had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time a fragile one.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some felt that it was enough to vote and make democracy as direct as possible to its enemies.
Since Napoleon "Smallogo" knows it's coming from the surface of the mind.
General vote, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not sufficient and can even become “a tool of repression” as once described by the philosopher-Republic of Etienne Vasro.
No, democracy requires a lot more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all, it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinody of the true and false Greek referendum will have a double disemboweling effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its inability and inconsistencies.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted, and many believe that the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a leap with tied feet to the brink of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of the guillotine lesions, but of the implementation of choice and democracy, together, clear and continuous, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - a crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from weakness and lack of solidarity.
All of Europe has been completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty and each of its nations with it.
The management of the European project under popular sovereignty must be restored urgently.
Because only a European working together can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal, Socialists and Jacques Delore all now demand a European economic government.
Let's do that.
But to represent it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has been put into practice is another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolutions of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in effect.
We must build Europe, united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the true people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Infinite chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Mapping Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will result in 11 per cent of the world's sales of microprocessors (banking cards, SIM-cards), exceeding 6,000 million according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector of non-contact technologies, which allows to pay for public transport or purchases, simply maps the reading device.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chips will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and will account for almost 10 per cent of the world's map market (6,925 million maps).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function, and 75,000 terminals have been accepted.
France starts in a more modest way: there are 400,000 contactless Visa maps in circulation.
But big stores keep up.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to supply their clients with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute uncontacted bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gerard Nebuy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using their mobile phone.
But this is just the first phase of the future payment, that is, the mobile phone.
To date, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC technology (Communication of the Near Field) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must really fly away next year."
"We are counting on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
Apparatus for approximately 200 clients and staff will be provided with non-contact helmets.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algerians were now confident.
“The method used by these two organizations and the secret service reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation of the abduction of two French nationals in Niger in January revealed two links.
The people who were abducted at a restaurant in Niamey near Aqmi, Antoine de Leokour and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day, along with several of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Majdiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradles, and the other to a man who is alleged to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“For many years it has been known that the sect has been receiving financial and creative support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram ' s actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Fast Success
Founded in Majdigura in 2002 at the mosque, school and Immortalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and requires strict adherence to sharia, and its activists have begun fighting against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists from Boko Haram had been particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern ewes.
In the past Christmas she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram, in Abuja, launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern for all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger, while the Somalis from Al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Gudlak, Jonathan Allen Juppee warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
Peace, as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America’s weakened crisis lead a complex world through simple, more precise, simplistic ideas?
If we listen to Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Hermann Kane, Rick Perry and others have been plentiful but lacking details of the foreign policy statement, which is traditionally a strong republican side.
The slogans relating to China, Iran and Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving from the “Old Good Party”, threatened to complain to the Chinese in the WTO and to accuse them of “manipulating his currency is a sensitive topic for America, which is irritated by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
Even worse, if it would lead to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, failed to fight the attitude that fuels emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the ratings, has remained unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he announced."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his promises to the partner.
The company Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated a frustrating lack of knowledge of the case.
He has recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the US Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of suspects in terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michel Bachman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president are saying that Reagan had simple ideas, too, and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, at the premature withdrawal of the “kids” from Iraq, his exploits in Libya, which gave him a reputation for weak politics.
But it's not that simple.
The population considers the national security balance of Obama, which has been eliminated by Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds in sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply 30 million households with gas equivalent.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate the event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated in last Tuesday on the banks of the Baltic Sea, between the orchestra and the snacks found, in the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiona and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte, together, returned the symbolic valve controlling Russian gas to the Western European network.
Under the new pipeline, 27.5,000 million additional cubic metres of gas will reach Western Europe each year for the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the Leningrad area to the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be available at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany by avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will become more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to deny access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, insinuating the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
While supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a brand between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already at their disposal.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically binds us”, said François Fiona, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom heads, who were present in large numbers in Lyubmin, the gas point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel trapped in concrete to protect it from anchor ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the minefields remaining from the Second World War had to be bypassed.
“The hundred needed to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Mueller, North Stream’s press secretary.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without bursts throughout its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian State company would move to its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we will cut the gas flow less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So if the gas in the pipeline leaks, it's going to blow up.
But this seems unlikely to be the designers who designed stitches designed to flow only once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an insider.
The cigar-shaped device shall be inserted inside a pipe with a diameter of 1 m and shall be driven forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for a minor repair.
The gas circulation is carried out only by pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies combined efforts to implement the project.
Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of its capital, remains the leader.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie Group and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies set up a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Tsug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total volume of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of the amount of gas that will actually be transported”, says Jens Muller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be 7.4,000 euros for two pipelines.
The investment of GDF Suez will be around 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay off their expenses because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The pipeline comes out of the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin on a sandy bank planted with pine trees.
The vents form a gas output terminal at a height of 5 feet [4.5 m].
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
Full capacity will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste of writing.
He has the scent of adventures, hours of writing in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine Bloc is easy to find out about the rectangular black cover, on the rubber side, on the yellow and white pages, as if desired over time.
However, the record book Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, the milkkin, the lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the straps.
Writers and travelers are said to appreciate this type of blocknote.
“Moleskine has brought today’s taste into line with the old and forgotten thing that was cultive to the 20th century,” said Maria Seregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We went far from producing the first few years when only 3,000 blocknotes were produced.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to identify a typical buyer because the notebook similarly attracts a businessman, a student and a person of free profession.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at the Fnac bookstores, shopkeepers in small towns and was able to get a lot of publicity.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the appearance of an e-mail”, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition “Environmental Path” where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a leopard painting cover on the occasion of a cinema festival in Locarno.
Using his success and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
Success, which gave rise to envy: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page into the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities seek employment.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disturbing?
“No,” stressed Eric Blanche, Director-General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times that."
"But there's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them, more older persons: 37 per cent over 50 years (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a Bachelor ' s degree, and of 2.3 million students in higher education only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, is very common, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria make it very difficult to return to work and which are the core of the problems," said Christian Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, of the 1992 Association to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted by the IMS-Entreprendre Association of April on Cité's order showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented common people in wheelchairs or mental or mental disabilities”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of disabled workers in a law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
“Today we are about 3%”, says Pierre Blan, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “low-valued” organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised taxes, put a lot of pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blan."
“But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, in particular in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the organizations with workers from 20 to 49 have disabled workers against 82 per cent of the organizations with employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before meeting the Blue Night on Tuesday (20.45), Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We are not going to come to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting near the arena of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after the arrival of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, with his progress and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on, - convince the plaything of Lily.
Until the contrast between his achievements in the club and the assembly, that's one whole, he's justified.
"I've been in Lille for a year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to make points."
Left in reserve, in front of this match with France, against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denny to finally "bright".
Not to forget, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also strengthens the particular character of the match.
He remembers the fact that Mathieu is on the other side.
"Just crossed our paths."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "grateful."
Pride to play the "festive match."
Pride also claims as “neighbourly” that France “became a very high-level team” only a year after the Nazna injury.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires it.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, a tech athlete will fly on one plane with blue pilots... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see it in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal starts its match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality on the way to him.
"By the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paula Bent already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Assembly, which has been in charge since September 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a match that needs to be played, and there's a Bosniak that needs to be won.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Zenica hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for more than an hour, it had not achieved the goal of a consensual one that would calm it.
"It's a good result which, however, entails a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the audience, who should be thrilled, even though the match will be very intense," said the optimistic but judgmental Bent.
“We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in Euro 2012," said Carlusz Keiros' successor.
No one in a match against Bosnia Friday demands victory from the Portuguese.
No one could make Bosnians.
"It's a good result that there is, however, some risk, regrets Benta.
“We will play against a team with many technical dignitys and many individual dignitys for players,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
Good idea, just this once, she'd be realistic.
