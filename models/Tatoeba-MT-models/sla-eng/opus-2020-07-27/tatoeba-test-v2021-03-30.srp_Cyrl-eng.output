Where do you live?
Why would I want to kill you all?
Bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
We kind of survived.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I got a cat and a dog, and the cat's black and the dog's white.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what do you care?
I just got up.
How does it feel?

You don't learn that at school.
Is it clear?
Stop resisting!
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Are you a maniac?
Well done!
Many words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.

Never lose hope.
It was just cream on the cake.
Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a lollipops.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Introduce me to Tom.
After much deliberation, at the end of the day, I did things at random.
You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You let me down.
What's this?
Me, too.
That was very good.
She takes care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Go straight.
It's as simple as beans.
It's empty.
Where'd you get that idea?
Mary giggled.
I give up.
I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had a quick lunch.
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why do you do that, if I may ask?
You can't blame everything, Tom.
Give me an example.
What day is it tomorrow?
Can you set an example?
Tom drinks like a wick.
Is that what you want?
That's not like you.
I can't see.
We're close friends.

Are you free tonight?
I like to watch you dance.
They replaced the coal with oil.
It was snowing.
How can I say that in your language?
That's not a good sign.
I didn't tell him you were here.
It's good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
We live in an atomic age.
Mary makes a living sewing.
Where's Tom gonna sleep?
Did you get enough sleep last night?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
There's nothing going on with my hand today.
This is Brian Rock.
Two guys ran out of the room.
It's never too late to study.
First we have to find them.
Tom was very scared.
It's snowing.
You can't blame everything, Tom.
Tom looked a lot different after the haircut.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I made my first move.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Don't waste words for nothing.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write Tom?
We ran out of construction.
I'm a rookie.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
Everything happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see.
I was trying to be kind.
I'm naked.
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's overburned.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't you cry!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You're under oath.
I wish I knew.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took my wig off.
That's my cat.
He's standing right there.
He's known as the great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
I'll go.
What's all the fuss about?
I don't understand why they're such good friends.
This is a book.
The bedroom's upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you gonna do today?
Taxi's expensive.
Logic is clearly your strong suit.
I'd love to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You're absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
What should I call a cab?
You didn't answer the question.
He was bare-chested and bare-footed.
I can ski.
What makes you say that?
It's snowing today.
I have a headache today.
I think Tom pulled the thicker end.
I'll fix the homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
The office door is yellow.

Sorry, the connection's still busy.
What's wrong with you?
What do you have to do?
"You speak too much," he said.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
He was bare-headed and bare-footed.
I don't know why I have a headache.
Thomas is crazy about Mary.
Are you Uighur?
Don't be mad.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as scary as it looks.

Why didn't you say so at once?
You're sad.
Everyone's lying.

In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that, and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his honest opinion, and when he writes it, but in advance he would know that it will never appear in the press. I have received my regular salary to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers that I am working for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any one of you would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks, would find himself out in the street, looking for another job. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear in just one newspaper that I am working for, I would have been fired from my job in less than 24 hours. (...)

So this is how it ends?
What's this?
Turn around.

Man has many desires that he doesn't really want to achieve, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be bitter disappointment for him.That is one desire for eternal life. If it had been fulfilled, man would have become completely sick of endless life, and would have wanted death.
