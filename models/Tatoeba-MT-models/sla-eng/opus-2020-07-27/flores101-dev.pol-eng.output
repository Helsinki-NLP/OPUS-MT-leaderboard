The International Earthquake Map of the US scientific and research agency USGS did not report any earthquakes in Iceland last week.
In the last 48 hours, there have been no earthquakes in the Hekla region.
The significant seismic activity resulting from phase changes was recorded on 10 March on the north-east side of the highest volcanic caldera.
Dark clouds were observed at the bottom of the mountain, which are not due to any volcanic activity.
The clouds may have made it difficult to identify the actual eruption.
The moon transported 120-160 cubic metres of fuel when there was an accident and strong wind blowing in conjunction with the waves pushed it onto the falsification.

The former disciple said that he “talked slang in classes, taught dating skills and was like a fellow student. ”
China has developed a market economy over the past 30 years, although the official communist system has not undergone a transformation.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were implemented.
Since then, China’s economy has grown 90 times.
Last year China exported more cars than Germany for the first time, racing the United States as the largest market in the industry.
In two decades, China can outnumber the United States GDP.
Danielle's tropical cyclone, the fourth called hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2010, formed in the East Atlantic.
The storm ranges approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, reaches the maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that by Wednesday, Danielle will take on force and become a hurricane.
Since the storm is far from the ground, it is difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, who came to the world in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, became famous because of the game at Partizan Belgrad.
He was with them from 1945 to 1958.
When he was on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 meetings.

Luckily, I didn't get hurt, but I won't forget that macabre scene when people tried to knock out the windows to get out.
People were banging in the windows of the chairs, but the windows were made of unbroken glass.
"One of the glass finally broke, so people started going out the window," said the surviving Francisek Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat, using the energy generated in the process of combining (or melting) hydrogen atoms to form heavier particles.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, the solution to this problem will be difficult and many years will pass before a useful thermonuclear reactor can be constructed.
The steel pin drifts on the surface of the water due to the tension on the surface.
The surface tension occurs because the water particles on its surface attract more than the water and air particles above them.
Such objects as needles are able to float on the water ceiling by means of the invisible coating that particles form on the surface of the water.
The bee of a modern skate has two edges divided by a handle. Two edges increase the grip on ice, even when set in a direction.
The edge of the blade is slightly curved, so when the blade bends to one side, the back of the ice is warped.
This makes the skater turn. When the skates move to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skates turn to the left, the skater turns to the left.
In order to return to an earlier level of energy, they must remove additional energy from light.
They're doing this through the emissions of a tiny particle of light called a photon.
This process is defined by scientists as a "stimulated radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by a bright light, which causes photon of light to be emitted, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows photon atoms. Of course, photons are much smaller than on this image.
Photons are even smaller than particles that form atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work will cause the bulb to finally burn and the bulb will cease to glow.
Then the bulb must be replaced. Caution should be exercised when exchanging the bulb.
First, turn off the light or turn off the cable.
This is because the current affecting the lamp in which the metal part of the bulb is located can seriously defeat when touching the interior of the lamp or the metal base when it is partly in the lamp.
The primary organ in the circulation system is the heart, pumping blood.
Blood is drained from the heart by "wires", which are called arteries, and supplied by "wires" called veins. The definition of the vessel hair refers to the smallest such "wires".
Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, triceratops were fed by sagovets, or typical plants for the chalk period.
This plant resembles a small palm tree with a crown formed by sharp, plentiful leaves.
A strong patch could be useful for triceratops when he wanted to pick up the leaves before he took off to eat the stump.
Other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, although today sloths and other animals, such as parrots (seeds of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would the force of gravity on the moon of Io work on me?
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the Io moon. Gravity power is, of course, much smaller.
The sun has no shell like the Earth on which you can stand. The sun is entirely of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas is diluted as it moves away from the center of the sun.
The outer rim that we see when we look at the sun is called the photo sphere, which literally means “the sphere of light”.
Like the phases of the moon, Venus observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) Galileo, using a telescope.
The phases are that the light reaches only one side of Venus (or the Moon), the one that is turned to the Sun. Copernicus theory, according to which planets orbit around the Sun, had its confirmation in the Venus phases.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the transit of Venus a few years later, in 1639.
After Danelaw’s visit, England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991 Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, which could only be compared to the Guthrum fleet hundreds of years ago.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, Norway, whose ambition was to get rid of Denmark's domination of its country.
At first, Ethelred was not led into the battlefield, but he was able to come to an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway and tried to regain his kingdom, though with various consequences.
Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was invented in 1444 under the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Seyong sits on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty and enjoys great recognition to this day.
At first, he will define the alphabet hangul called Hunmin Jeongeum, which is “the correct sounds to teach people. ”
About how Sanskrit was born, many theories were formulated, and one of them spoke of the migration of Aryans who brought their language from west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is considered to be the Eastern equivalent of European Latin.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After developing the sunscreen, the sanscrit simply lost importance because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a highly complex and rich language, from which many modern languages are produced in India, just as Latin is a source of European languages, e.g. French and Spanish.
After the victory campaign in France, Germany set off with preparations for the invasion of Great Britain.
The Germans called the attack "Lew Morski". Most of the heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost at the time of Dunkierka’s departure, so the army was quite weak.
Nevertheless, the British Navy still overpowered the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would influence the Channel of La Manche.
Few British Navy ships were on potential invasion routes because the admirals feared their sinking by attacking the Germans from the air.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was first of all a "younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and navy were weaker, even though four new ships were built just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. To take over, they needed a start-up platform for the troops to cross the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.
In order to do so, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. Moreover, Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, Japan was an island country, just like the United Kingdom.
Underwater boats are vessels designed for longer journeys below the surface of the water.
Submarines were used during World War I and II. They were very slow and had limited firing ranges.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but with the development and greater accuracy of the radar, submarines were forced to descend underwater to avoid detection.
The German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans managed perfectly to navigate and operate submarines.
The Germans have successfully benefited from submarines and, therefore, because of lack of confidence in the war, they did not want to have too many.
Yes! King Tutenchamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King of the boy", is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times he was not considered important, he was not included in most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, it became a celebrity. Although many ancient tombs fell victim to robberies, this tomb was virtually intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutenhamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the Assyrian chariots, they were lighter, faster, and more effective in the persecution of warriors and other chariots.
Shots from their murderous bows could have broken the armor of the enemy soldiers, more or less in 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
Cavalry is a military formation made up of armed horsemen. The saddle was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalrymen sat down on their horses.
Many are famous Greek politicians, scholars and artists. Probably the most famous figure in this culture is Homer, the legendary invisible poet who created two epic masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristofanes are still popular dramatists whose art is seen among the greatest works in the world’s literature.
Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, a mathematician, known first and foremost from his famous statement about the relationship of sides in rectangles.
There are various calculations on the number of people using Hindi. It is estimated that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
The inclusion or exclusion of closely related dialects affects the determination of the total number of native users of a given language.
According to estimates, 340 to 500 million people use this language and 800 million are able to understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu, vocabulary is similar, but the letter is different; in everyday communication users of both languages are usually able to communicate.
Sometime in the 15th century, northern Estonia was under very great cultural influence by Germany.
Some of the German monks wanted to bring God closer to the local population, so they invented a literal Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet, but one sign was added: ‘Õ/õ’.
With the passing of time, many words borrowed from German joined together. It was the beginning of enlightenment.
In line with the tradition of throne heirs after graduation, he went straight to the army.
However, Charles went to the University of Trinity College from Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then his history, winning 2:2 (the lower degree of second degree).

The European part of Turkey (including East Tracja or Rumela in the Balkan Peninsula) represents 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey exceeds 1,600 kilometres (1000 miles) of length and 800 kilometres (500 miles) of width, with an approximately rectangular shape.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, extends to 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) lies in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9174 square miles) in Europe.
The surface of Turkey is made up of the 37th country of the world in terms of size, in terms of size, about the size of the metropolitan France and the Great Britain taken together.
Turkey has access to the sea from three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but independence was gained in 1839.
Today’s parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became the property of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 30th century.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, it has not avoided German occupation during the first and second world wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg joined the organisation we know today under the name of the European Union as a Member State and founder.
Drukyal Dzong is the ruins of the fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built a fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
After the 1951 fire, only some relics of Drukyal Jonga remained, e.g. the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected and is still one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was cramped between two powerful neighbors: Thailand and Vietnam.

In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaqui, the orchid hybrid, gained the status of the national flower.
Each year, in the vicinity of October, nearly 1.5 million herbivorous animals are being driven from the north hills to the south plains by crossing the Mara River.
And then again to the north, through the west, again through the Mara River, after the April rains.
Serengeti District consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Protective Area, Tanzania Wildlife Reserve and Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive activities (credential creation, film editing and sound recordings, storytelling, etc.).
In order to design interactively, re-evaluate the assumptions about media production and learn to think non-linearly.
In an interactive project, the elements must be connected, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the variable-focal lens is that the complexity and number of elements needed to achieve a specified range of focal distances are much greater than in the stagnating lens.
This is becoming increasingly a problem because lens producers are becoming more and more standards in their production.
Thanks to this, the lens can be photographed with a quality comparable to that obtained by the lens with a fixed focal point.
Another minusor of variable-focal lenses is the fact that the maximum width of the lens (speed) is generally smaller.
For this reason, cheaper variable-focal lenses make it difficult to light light the light when the flash is not used.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to a DVD format is adjusting the image size.
Satisfaction of the overall customers is a key criterion in the production of most TVs.
That's why everything on the TV screen had edges cut down, up and down.
This should ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This function bears the overscan name.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its frame will probably be cut, and if the inscriptions in the recording are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
The tournaments, banquets and Knights of the Round Table have long been elements of an imagination inspired by the traditional motif of the medieval castle.
Even standing among the thousands of years of ruins, you can easily summon the sounds and smells of long past battles and practically hear the rumble of hooves on the mud, as well as the feeling of terror suffocating from the locusts.
But is this reality a builder of our imagination? Why have castles been started at all? How have they been designed and built?
Standard for this period Kirby Muxloe Castle is a more Fortified house than a real castle.
Large glass windows and tinted walls would not have been able to resist a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was relatively calm, only needed protection from small groups of highwaymen.
The balance of power was a system within which the European nations tried to maintain national sovereignty of all countries in Europe.
In line with this concept, all European nations had to hit the power of one nation and that is why governments have often changed allies to maintain international balance.
The first armed conflict, at the stake of the balance of power, is a war of Spanish success.
This was an important change, since European powers would no longer have the right to engage in religious wars, so 30-year war would be the last war to be called religious.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. as a result of the laying of fire by Herostratus.
The accused Ephesians announced that the name Herostrates should be erased from human memory.
The Greek historian Strabon then wrote the name as we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born on.
Alexander offered to cover the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

Sikhism is a religion that was born on the Indian subcontinent in the Punjab region in the 15th century due to a rift within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs do not identify their religion with Hinduism, although they admit that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means “Dróg guru”. Guru is the foundation of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it is so important that it is the essence of the beliefs of the Sikhs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), and another nine gurus are among its successors.
However, in June 1956 there was a confrontation between the promises of Khrushcheva with residents in Poland, when worker demonstrations against food shortages and cuts of wages turned into a protest in communism as such.

The civilisation of the Indus Valley existed in the Epoca Bruzu in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, including most of today's Pakistan, as well as part of the regions in northwestern India and north-eastern Afghanistan.
Civilisation flourished in the river Indus basin, where its name came from.
Although they are scientists who believe that because this civilization existed in the river basin today in the dry Saraswati, it is equally well known as the Civilization of Indus-Saraswati, while other researchers use the name "Harrapan Civilisation", referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 20th century.
The militaristic character of the Roman Empire contributed to the progress in the field of medicine.
The first medical recruitment was initiated by Emperor Augustus and resulted in the first Roman medical corps serving wounded soldiers in battle.
The surgeons knew a variety of tranquilizers, including morphine obtained from pollen seeds extracts and scopolamine from black bulb seeds.
They gained amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as to use pressure belts and blood pressure clamps to inhibit blood flow.
For centuries the Roman Empire has achieved much in the field of medicine and has influenced the knowledge we have today.
The origami of Pureland is that only one bend is allowed, for example bends and bends, and all bends must have a straight position.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help people who have no experience in making origami or whose mobility is limited.
In children, awareness of race and racial stereotypes develops early, and these stereotypes influence behaviour.
For example, children identified with a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, is not doing well in school, and they are generally not doing well when they learn about the stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third most popular site in the United States, with 54 million profiles.
These websites attract great attention, especially in the educational environment.
These sites have their positive aspects, including the possibility of easily configuring a class site containing blogs, video materials, photos and other elements.
You can access this page by providing only one web address, which makes it easier to remember and write to students who may have problems with writing and writing on the keyboard.
This can be adjusted to facilitate reading, as well as with any or a small amount of color.
The disorder syndrome “is a neurological accident, defined classically by a triad of symptoms: impulse, deconcentration and overinclusion or excessive energy”.
This is not disability, it is a learning disorder that “touchs from 3 to 5 percent of children, maybe 2 million American children. ”
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on learning, but for this they can focus on what makes them happy, such as playing games or watching favorite cartoons or writing words without any punctuation.
These children tend to get into trouble because “they take risky behaviors, get into fights and challenge authority” to stimulate the brain because they cannot get it by normal means.
ADD affects relationships with peers who may have problems understanding why someone behaves in this way, why they write and why their maturity is different.
The skills of learning and learning have changed in the way described above, and the pace of learning has changed as well.
The relationship to information was different. The press was no longer in personal memory, but more important was the ability to summon text.
The renaissance has fundamentally changed the approach to science and knowledge dissemination.
Unlike other primary hominids, they no longer use hands to move, carry loads or move between trees.
The hand and foot of chimpanzees have a similar size and length, which shows that the hand is used to carry the weight of the body when walking is based on folded fingers.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more upright sticks.
The fossilized hand bones from two to three million years ago show how hand specialization has changed, from movement to manipulation.
According to some, the frequent calling of conscious dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams prolong the time between REM stages.
If the less stage of paradoxical sleep occurs at night, the problem becomes the low frequency of the condition in which you actually sleep and your body regenerates.
It's as exhausting as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes after watching TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously during the night has an effect.
Since the beginning of the Italian case in North Africa, they have not been doing well. On the week since the Italians declared war on 10 June 1940, 11 Husaria British took over Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
General Lastucci, head of the engineering forces of the 10th Italian army, was captured by the British in ambush east of Badria.
On 28 June, the marshal, Ilo Balbo, governor-general of Libya and obviously the successor of Mussolini, was killed by the murderous fire during his landing in Tobruk.

One who wins the smallest number of bats or attacks in his account.
The game is played on grass, which is shorter around the hole and is called green.
Recreational tourism is probably the most common type of tourism, by most people associated with travel.
That's when people go to places that are completely different from what surrounds them every day to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and bicommunal areas are usually the most popular places used by holiday tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that involves learning the history and culture of the places visited.
Tourists can visit different country’s characteristic sites or can focus only on one area.
The colonists, looking at this activity, also called for food.
The frontal reinforcements consisted of the 1st and 3rd regiments of the New Hampshire regiment, 200 men, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both became generals).
The Stark sub-commands lined up along the northern edge of the position occupied by the Colonists.
When the outflow opened a free passage along the Mystic River from the northeast side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fortification of a short stone wall from the northern edge at the shore on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark pierced a stake about 100 feet (30 m) from the fort and ordered not to shoot until the shooters crossed that line.
The American plan consisted of coordinated attacks carried out from three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will start a diversion against the British garrison in Bordenown to block any support.
General James Ewing was about to cross the river at Trenton Ferry with 700-person troops moving together, take over Assunpink Creek and strike the escape of enemy troops.
There was a 2,400 armed force on the attack log that was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and split up, creating two units, one under Greene's command, the other under Sullivan's leadership, to launch an attack before dawn.
When the distance of the course is changed from one quarter to half a mile, the speed is lost in importance, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a top runner half a mile, which can break two minutes, must have a high speed, but endurance should be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter passes, combined with the training of upper body parts at the gym, are the best preparations for the running season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee excellent results, but can significantly affect the overall form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective irrigation habits and understanding various aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve the results and increase the pleasure of sport.
Distance runs are relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many myths about several necessary equipment elements.
Products may be purchased according to needs, but most of them will have a negligible or zero impact on productivity.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer a product, although it does not offer any real benefits.
Atom can be considered one of the fundamental elements that build up all matter.
It is a very complex unit that consists, according to the simplified Bohra model, of the central nucleus around which electrons are found, which somewhat resembles planets orbiting the Sun – see figure 1.1.
The nucleus includes two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
In terms of electrical charge, protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no load.
To find out what happened to the victim, you must first assess whether the scene is a threat to you.
As you approach the victim, keep an eye on the victim’s position, as well as keep an eye on the natural warning signals.
If you hurt yourself by trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study showed that depression, fear, and pessimistic attitude were closely related to the pain and fragility of people suffering from cross pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking were dependent on regular, organized weekly physical exercises, but such dependence did not occur in case of depression and fear.
Regularly active people need more support when it comes to negative pain perceptions to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal traffic.
The vision, or vision, depends on the organs of the eyes, or eyes.
The design of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Various systems are characterized by different possibilities, different wavelengths and different degrees of visual acuity, and also require different processes to interpret input data, and an appropriate number of organs to function optimally.
The population is called the collection of organisms of one species residing in a specific geographical area.
All individuals in the population with a specific phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterized by several variants of a particular feature, they are polymorphic.
Military ants' colonies march and lay their nests in other stages.
During the wandering phase, the ant army marches at night and encamps during the day.
The colony begins the nomadic phase when the amount of food available has decreased. During this phase the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Every such nomad rally or march lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? This word is derived from a Latin “cella”, which means “a small chamber”, and it was tamed by a researcher who was observing the structure of the cork under the microscope.
The cell is the basic builder of all living organisms, in which the composition must be at least one cell.
In fact, it is so fundamental and crucial to the role of cells in the study of life that they are often called “the elements of life. ”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that blood flow is not disrupted.
These nerve impulses travel around the body at such a high rate that they help protect them from potential dangers.
tornadoes strike in a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
tornadoes rip out trees, rip the boards off buildings, and throw cars into the air. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last over three hours.
In these monstrous storms, the wind reaches a speed of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s, 300 mph).
For thousands of years, people have produced and used lenses to view objects in larger sizes.
But the first real telescopes were built in Europe at the 16th century landfill.

Many people dream of the day when they can travel to another star and discover other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets inhabit aliens or other forms of life.
But if it ever happens, it's not for a long time. Stars are very far apart, these neighbors often share billions of miles.
Maybe someday your great-grandchildren will be in a strange world, thinking about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells, eating things and digesting them. Most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that we only find in animals, and yet not all jellyfish, for example, have no brain.
There's no place on earth where there's no animals.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The source of the word “cell” is the Latin word “cella” meaning a small room.
Looking at living beings under a microscope, you can see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, saw the cork under the microscope and saw small squares.
From the looks of it, they looked like rooms, and he was the first person to watch dead cells.
The originals and relationships can pass from one state to the other and never change.
Gas nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. In liquid state it is denser, but the particles are identical.
Another example is water, consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
The molecular structure is identical for gas, liquid and solid.
Although the state of focus may change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is all around us, it affects every action we make, and at the same time it's so hard to understand.
For thousands of years it has been the subject of research by scholars, philosophers and theologians.
We experience time as a period of events from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also used to compare the duration of events (the duration of the events).
You can indicate the flow of time on your own by observing the recurrences of a cyclic event, the characteristic of which is regular repetition.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long recognized that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, hunting giant birds called moa.
According to this theory, the Maoris sailed the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand and took it to the Moriori people, after which they settled as a farming community.
However, the latest evidence shows that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Island and developed their own peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham there was another tribe, the Maoris, who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were a few old men, and in the end, Moriori were executed.
Those who have been giving for decades have made us see the value of our advantages and love, and on the other hand, we have been able to face challenges and failures honestly.
When we listened to people who told stories about their personal, family, or work life, we received many valuable information about the past and about personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the culture of organizations.
Although understanding our history does not involve understanding culture, at least it helps us to understand where we are in the history of the organization.
Thanks to the assessment of the success and awareness of failures, individuals, as well as a whole group of participants, are better acquainted with the values, mission and motivation of the organisation.
In this case, people opened up to new changes and a new direction for the local church, recalling the entrepreneurial behaviour and its success in the past.
Such success stories have mitigated the concerns of change, and they have inspired a positive attitude towards future changes.
Methods of solving problems using different concepts or fields to find a solution called convergence thinking patterns.
This attitude of mind focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of available techniques and the collection of information.
The most important part of this way of thinking: there is only one correct answer. You only take into account two answers – good and bad.
This type of reasoning is linked to certain sciences or standard procedures.
People of this type of thinking can think logically, memorize patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
People are the most capable species when it comes to reading in the mind of others.
It follows that we can effectively predict what others perceive and intend, what they believe, what they know and what they want.
The most important of these skills is the understanding of the intentions of others, as this can help to resolve possible uncertainties arising from the actions carried out.
For example, if we saw someone punching a window in the car, we'd probably assume he's trying to steal someone's car.
He should be judged differently if he lost his car keys and tried to break into his vehicle.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon called magnetic nuclear resonance (NMR) discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (working at Harvard).
In this resonance, atoms emit delicate radio signals with the effects of magnetic fields and radio waves.
In 1970, doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how magnetic resonance imaging can be used for medical diagnostic purposes.
Four years later, the patent was the world's first patent in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the scan for the whole body's magnetic resonance, which he called "The Unbreakable".
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and another person's response.
This enables students to work at their own pace and control the pace of instruction.

A postmodern approach to science gives freedom from absolute truths. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one thing that should be learned from science. Learning this is a process that happens in the experience of interaction between the learner and the knowledge that is presented.
This is our current experience with television programmes, which present information, educate, teach and provide practical advice (“do it yourself”).

The coldest place on Earth is Antarctica, located around the south pole.
Tourist tours cost a lot, require a good physical condition, are possible only in summer (from November to February) and are mainly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
During the summer period about fifty bases in these areas there are several thousand workers, but only a small number of workers live here in winter.
Central Antarctica is a populated plateau that covers 2-3 km of ice.
Occurrences of specialty air trips take place in the depths of the land for mountaineering purposes or to reach the pole where the large base is located.
