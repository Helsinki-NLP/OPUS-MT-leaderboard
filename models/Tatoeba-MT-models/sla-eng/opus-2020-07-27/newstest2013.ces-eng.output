Re-election strategies of the Republic Party against Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policy of necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.
However, Brennan’s headquarters calls such fraud a myth that election fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been proclaiming new laws since 2009 that make it difficult for the election process or to register on the electoral list.
This phenomenon was recorded after the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting electoral law in 41 countries were submitted in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identity card and proof of American state citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit pre-election periods, infringe the right to enroll in the voter list on the day of the elections and take the election rights of citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, he did not require any U.S. State to present an identity card to voters.
The first state to implement this request was Indiana.
The Constitution of Indian Law confirmed the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the last two years, they have supported the draft laws in 34 states to force voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebek, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people at the age of voting, no identity card with a photo issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the required identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not therefore have the required photo identity card.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are familiar with their tendency to democratic candidates are not entitled in several countries to use their identity card with a photo displayed by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use the cards displayed by these clubs in the elections.
By 2004, no state had required citizenship documents in the election.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is imperative to note that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported eight states with laws that disrupt the voter registration on the day of the elections.
In addition, they restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigning to register voters helped to register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 have led to a decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In another five countries, Republican legislators adopted laws aimed at shortening the electoral period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of voters voted ahead, although African-American voters in the country were only 13%.
It was the same with the Spaniards.
They formed only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, the whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have taken a very strong stand against the approval of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills by veto.
In order to halt the validity of the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, the damage was limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identity card.
However, the newly introduced rules will render the exercise of voting rights completely undeniable in 2012.
The democratic critics refer in particular to the pre-eminence of approved laws and consider them to be a clear effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 Centre report shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral corps needed to win the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
One thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: do you undergo examination or not?
The PSA test produced some false results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitation of the men who were already so afraid to go for the exam at all.
Should I be investigated or not?
We asked for an opinion from two experts.
High levels of contamination among individual tested groups have been demonstrated in US studies, making it difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Further studies, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who have undergone the examination and those who have failed to do so.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who fail exams have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I therefore recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old examination if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more threatened by the group.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is revealed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are volatile.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of risk of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that has no impact on life in the long term, and focus on active disease surveillance in such cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer type is not aggressive and does not threaten them with life.
We propose to them that we carry out active surveillance and, in the case of disease progression, we offer them treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we set the criteria that help in deciding which type to treat and which one does not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to have a doctor’s interview and to determine whether or not it is appropriate to undergo the examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Company, it created a Movember instrument which allows to evaluate for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous way to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease taking the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented if all ate healthy and moved sufficiently.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this data would have increased to at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer is caused by hereditary properties.
Some percentage also remain completely unexplained.
For a Canadian cancer research company, smoking control remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes cost 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebek today," spokeswoman André Beaulieu.
A encouraging indication: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death to cancer is halved.
Weight
Health and obesity are, according to SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, and limb cancer, esophagus, mucous membranes and uterus.
"Research indicates that regular physical activity throughout its life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too much consumption, it can lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid the same crop for which the same is true.
Conservation of meat by training, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are, according to the SCC, contradictory.
Although one suggests that prostate cancer will be at risk, another study suggests an increase in prostate cancer.
Neither the effect of vitamin D on cancer is clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his family’s concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Being tested doesn't mean you're gonna have cancer."
Higgs Boson surveyed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it's also the last particle the standard model predicts -- our best or "at least bad" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter -- which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty that Higgs's boss is involved in physics.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during a major physical convention in Kyoto is more likely to confirm it, but there is still no data available to be absolutely certain.
However, let's assume that it's the Higgs boson, because the risks of error appear small, and let's see what's really going on.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed - and do not try too hard, or you will be hurt.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take up the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "position" roughly creates some of their properties.
Then they divide the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organised citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end there are barefoots, vile anarchists, who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: meatballs, which we leave here without notice, and "force particles", which spread great natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these barefoots are not as exotic animals as they might be thought to be.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: photon, or "participation of light", which is the "response" of electromagnetic force.
Because when particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, it "disengages" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power bearers".
A more stable field
Also, it's with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "disarm" requires a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like the frozen pond level, that only a very large log will be drained.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large carnivorous accelerator with a back-to-back circuit is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field again serves to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
The electromagnetic field does not respond to any particulate matter or material.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep on its own.
And the same goes for the Higgs field not to respond to all particles: those that do have some mass, while others (such as photons, let's see) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks what all this research is about, what do they bring us?
From the point of view of science, it is about confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and SM predictions.
In addition, few physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the smallest difference could open the space of "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model still has enormous shortcomings, does not provide any explanation of gravity (earth!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (again an echo!).
However, CERN has not yet found such a dispute.
Responses
The responses to these research in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can only be seen to be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.
Look: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers had no laser in Bell’s laboratories, nor any idea of a revolution that would trigger their work.
They assumed scientific exploitation, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I had already said that - laser was initially considered to be such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine it...
In addition, the application can come from all the tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and awarded him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that we have to change our lives around LHC, but that means that you never really know...
palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission for Dignified Dying, Quebek recently became involved in a sensitive issue regarding the end of life.
The debate should continue shortly and the bill is being drafted.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care of Victor-Gaddbois in Beloeil, where he came the last day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," she adds.
The disease has done its work: extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or just to eat himself.
She looks at the taste of breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage for an ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," she confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In a lifetime, one learns that men urinate," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gaddbois.
To return to the child’s stage is unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person", whether he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
In the view of a number of people concerned with palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a home with palliative care Victor-Gaddbois suffer from all cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear to die "to be strangled with full consciousness".
The illness, however, enabled me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life anymore," she says, and then she will allow us to put on her breathing device.
Yet he still enjoys the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gaddbois, care for the body with the help of nutrition is provided in cooperation with a group of volunteers.
That's what palliative care looks like when you can't do anything else anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we all realize that we're going to die one day.
Life here continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be provided with brandy or pepsi, according to his taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch their sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They brought a beer to Mr. X last night, who died later last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
In Victor-Gaddbois' home, days go by, but they don't look like each other.
In addition to a 23 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family carefully based on pillows, while they toast him to his honor, a tragically-six - year - old man dies surrounded by his parents, his wife, and two young children after trying to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three or five beds for people with cancer up to 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gaddbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gaddbois and the Company for Domestic palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to medical care in Quebek that has led many doctors specialising in palliative care to fear the adoption of the Euthanasia Act and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by the tops in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they are demonstrating their disapproval of such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec Health System is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency in severe pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the unfavourable prognosis.
The hope of survival of Hélène Richard was already minimal when she left difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was done with the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick who want to die thank their nursing doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the team of palliative dicks eased their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Care Company, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often use palliative sedatives, which will sleep until the patient is finished, either by accident or permanently administered sedatives.
It cannot be said that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, who will not be relieved of pain, will have an increasing chance of access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebek
Travel administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political lobbyists and experts at the Italian mafia continue to tell what they know about the amazing "system", which mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, unionists and mafias.
This "department" came the Quebec tax collectors very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been divided since we adopted the essential measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It resulted in a 2011 scandal based on a thorough investigation of the embezzlement of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebek, approved by the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque financing of the parties and corruption of civil servants.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the ministry of transport has saved billions of dollars on orders," when some people held their instincts to gain a share in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has brought two mayors to the debate," he adds with hope that it will manage to "discover the cunning of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also involved in the fight with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the "Marteau's Types" police, who have since 2009 ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money" significantly eases the inflatability of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Another on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambia sparked sensation by the commission explaining the mechanism of "system" procurement.
He himself devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montréal to a mafia-related broker, who then transferred money to the Union Montreal party, for which he was running for Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambia has been generous to all sides since 2000 and has devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68 000) to the provincial parties, but in particular to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also admitted that he organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, the prices of which were overstretched
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in very detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money in the total amount of $736,000 in exchange for purchases with money pipelines in which he oversaw the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their fees for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-actions.
The mayor of Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of keeping his eyes closed without embarrassment over a parallel budget that brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal Members to issue a warning signal.
As a mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, he has been opposed to selling the common land purchased for $5 million and sold to... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of a thriving real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "he pulls strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the weary ant system to stop the gangrenous and catch the culprits".
According to her, the trial is "painful but positive".
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montréal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be returned.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public figures have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the ambassadors informed of this hit" unless they get into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the Québek election campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically, he says, "I hear it's just a weak diversion of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the gifts to $100, but according to it, the situation does not resolve: "Until the election spending is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive system of awarding public contracts and financing to the parties: "We can no longer fall; if we aim boldly at the essence of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with more control and respect for laws."
If this story has obscured the image of Quebek and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all who mock him to look at his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and PSG set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other or by an entirely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier when they're fighting.
It's all going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From the beginning of my preparation in INF Clairefontaine to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved at a certain level.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Supports from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that each training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for the game and wants to give maximum power.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot to do with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who played the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, it is not equal in the 1st league and it is among the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're staying in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have easily entered the eight-finals.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to move as far as we can.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
First, we want to win our qualifying group before Port so we can play the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a major European club, it must win titles and enroll in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a great failure not to win the 1st League like last year's season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing enough in last year's season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually you're 79-point clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think it's gonna work out this year.
Although large teams like Marseille, Lyon, or Bordeaux are also working for the title, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the PSG media is expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what's been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something in the paper that's hard on us, it's not very pleasant.
A man asks what more people might want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to adjust our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In Liza's masters, we've proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't hit the eight-finals in the second season, and they've also invested big amounts!
Given the sums invested, you can expect to have 15 points ahead of you!
It insults other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which were not very successful last year, moved with the new PSG to the next stage.
That shows how awesome the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and think that despite all the difficulties we have been able to overcome.
It seems as if the PSG relied on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovice in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
That means Ibrahimovic is very powerful and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, and he's proving to be the star of the 1st League.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect man and player.
And he respects the people he has around him.
What he has accomplished is truly remarkable.
This led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best defenses in the world, also allows others to grow together.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately for the injuries, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
I've also been able to play good games in the team today.
And I've been hoping for that since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you view Didier Deschamps’ first months as head of the national team?
He's got the results on him.
We're in a good place at the MS qualification.
The coach picks hard, he's close to the players and he can inspire for the win.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualified us for Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had no such fight for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
As is often the truth in these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudnym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, the euro...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers already involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is moving at the border of about $10 (the exchange rate is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) is concerned about this in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "the period of regular money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money because it is used as a "credit" for a video game procedure that a person gets a game or can buy (and sometimes even replace it back).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network depositors are books of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
In fact, each transaction between the two users takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public register of current accounts distributed all over the network.
The key phase lies in writing this new transaction into this book.
It is done by addressing the mathematical task given to computers, whose solver, as a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the stage of the split of the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "cut."
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (nearly zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be permanently displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would result in a change of footprint.
If the user wants to pay with the same money twice very quickly for the purpose of fraud (in ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided into one hundred million, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased with an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rises and falls.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and saved bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used cave does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paimium, a real money company that uses Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of laundering dirty money through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not reach.
In November, "grove discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul for turning bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a non-contact pay phone, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders where no new terminals or software is needed.
All you have to do is give me an address that you can "photograph and recognize by phone", explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and move towards more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB foresees overestimating the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
French units have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in Afghanistan, whom we punished, since we considered them terrorists.
And so are we, for we have lost 88 dead soldiers, and all those injuries and maimings.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tudziks have joined them.
They now experience tolerance and often help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without assault by air escort helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996 the conditions have changed significantly.
On that occasion, Kabul was empty, and the earth was in the blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered their kind of liberation, their return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, who have completely controlled the Al-Ka'id organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahedins, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to maintain women in a subordinate position.
The main ranks of the war against Soviet forces returned to power in 2001.
They became profiteers, strengthened state lands that sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were never in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaign, people long for a government that will not be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave the way those who have been able to use American generosity will leave: capital leakage is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideologies.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they learned about the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people will need work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish shows showing the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand up to her head be considered legitimate?
Former Soviet army commanders are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mining country with a strong influence on local identity, should be looking forward to a certain degree of decentralisation following the example of the Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzaí does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country is heavily dependent on foreign aid from the 1950s.
No industry has been able to restore, no dam is working, no essential irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
The advantage is a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, governmental control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has vastly ungrowthable wealth.
And it just made the sense that the Western states were here just to get it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the spot and without means to transport raw materials through the mountains but no mining can take place.
The Chinese have already left the Mes Aynak mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) an opportunity to explore a vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend on a large part of imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common aid types: girl and boy lycea, department of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "get a heart and soul" initiative has been in place to try to harmonise aid and military activities, which has been carried out by the Civil Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was cancelled in 2012, but has achieved a number of achievements in the common interest and steps for agricultural reconstruction in dozens of mountain villages thanks to the uncountable French non-governmental organisation.
These works, involving a number of local workers, have helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the working area.
What kind of memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in Capisa Province.
In order for these farmers to be freed from the uprising led by foreign groups, they wish, in their own words, to obtain minor civil assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has entered the next poker game.
While Egypt remains in its history most divided by the declaration of the constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, it decided to play the vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all others, that the Constitutional Assembly will approve the final text.
A few weeks ago, the Head of State granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the country’s constitutional stability and leads to legal expectations.
This new initiative has further strengthened the country's disunity.
In the view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues "in violation of his word" and "increasing the law".
However, its followers ensure that it is a means of turning around as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that makes the Brotherhood withdraw from the intention of the text to explain the article to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
As confirmed in the interview for American Weekend Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this quickly organised vote is built by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers" which should otherwise end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the said Founding Assembly with the vast majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the liberals were missing from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was announced, they knocked the door with the fact that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their steps.
In order to achieve resolution, 11 replacements were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is no surprise, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted out unanimously.
The commentators continued to comment on the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer when some members of the committee held that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, is ultimately consistent with the 1971 Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a mark of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Controversy," the liberals object, who see this as just a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of Al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on matters relating to the verification of the conformity of laws with the law of Shariah.
According to Egypt's Sophie Pommiere expert, this is disturbing because "people called for expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy."
The concerns of liberals are even more heartwarming that the next Rector of the university should be less moderate than that of the existing one.
"So far, no particular religious consequence has emerged.
Egypt remains a civil state with this constitution.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not lalames, but university staff, many of whom graduated from French schools," the mild concern Alexis Bluet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be a dispute over the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used here belong to a religious dictionary.
There is in particular a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic law science, note red.].
And in the future, there may be a question as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday, the approved text is highly criticized, apart from the religious pages, for the expanded powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there have been significant restrictions on the former regime.
Another disputed place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the verification of the budget for the defence will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, military courts will not prohibit the treatment of civilians, as the Association for the Protection of Human Rights has requested.
These associations talk about their doubts about the text they believe is against freedom.
The criminal act of blasphemy is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear in a television show last night, events are scheduled for this afternoon.
The state's head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, a bud of world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the size of Bible truths, modern comforts, and the inestimation of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
To visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God's mercy will come upon all those who enter this bath.
And Galilee, instead of Jesus' wonders: the transformation of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will pass through the road of pain, or Jesus ’ Cross road (Latin via Dolores).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment was held, walks through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God on Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian bud of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where according to Christian legend a tree was grown, from which they made the cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
Jerusalem also has the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Moors, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Tradition has it that people here leave notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Take a path to the vertical
The destruction of the fortress of Masada remained a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at a altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in mountaineering can access it with their own strength.
The others will take the rope to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country there is a well-known Hermon ski resort located at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists from the foot of the hill are transported by a quiddly bus.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods reportedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit a unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exposition, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with spa and spa users from that time.
In Caesarei it is worth a visit to the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Rodena.
There aren't any guides or souvenir tours.
The entrance fee is free and the gifts are strictly denied.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go inside and you'll find yourself in total darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can also be bathed in winter months because its water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is heated to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is warmer, and people bathe in it for a year.
The dead sea, by the way, is the most extraordinary sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur’s water is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps people and people who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, ecstasy, arthritis, airway inflammation, diabetes to treat your swollen nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the coast of the Mediterranean.
Through them was the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mention of this city is found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love the walkways by the narrow streets, named after the signs of the beast.
They say that if you press the walls of the "your" sign in the alley, your happiness will be favorably favored.
In Jaffa you may find newlyweds arriving from all over Israel and even from other lands to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, in the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and "get" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontsky.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population speaks in this country.
On the way, it is better to take money not in euro, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekel).
The city’s transport is mainly by buses, but there is a expressway in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Traveling all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can move for 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Israel celebrates Sabbath.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, he stops working in markets, in shops and in public transport.
And Sunday morning starts working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will get only kosher dishes: except pork, seafood, fish without shingles and dishes containing combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mussel hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls made of ground foreigner - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
Therefore, there are many well-fed cats, which are gracies "wavering according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The leading cats love crowded places, and they feel like they're getting into every good thing.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, according to the car brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will stand around 15 shekels a day.
The museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Numbers expressed
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to know the country and rest.
The promised country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than during the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While Members and Human Rights Defenders are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, cheaters have already appeared in the country to sell "failed" certificates
Every year 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force under which every working migrant would be required to pass a test on the knowledge of Russian.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and utilities sector, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, trials will consist not only of language skills but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend work permits.
An exception shall apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to either people who successfully managed to achieve attestation and obtain an academic degree until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Puštinov Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
The State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) supported the introduction of the testing initiative.
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders have been able to ask many times in the press the question: what does that actually mean?
What will change the obligation to speak a language for the Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service answer - it will allow for a reduction in the number of people who suffer from "slavery work."
Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers today, the head of the FMS Board of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev, explains.
The protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
Only the organised recruitment system will enable 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in non-working migrants, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowing the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonest people, who, under the pretext of helping him, will ensure a "show" in terrible, close dwellings, in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and slumber for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their country, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they take their passports, they don't pay their promised wages," confirms MS Tolib Sharipov, head of the Task Force.
Don't give up!
Less so that many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they want to get to, but have no experience even with the work concerned.
Of course, it is not their fault either, as rather misfortune: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tudziks can afford at least a reasonable basic education.
Their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to dress properly, wear and equip them for school.
As children grow up at a productive age, they have to go to work on their first chance.
Without knowing the language, it's hard, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
True, in view of the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only take place in those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even put together tests, and they won't get any other official jobs.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or the Unauthorized are forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have essentially false documents, without registration, and that's what blackmail cases are all about.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists his experience with the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuskadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, get a painting"
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that false documents of migrants for registration were not only false.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of language examination.
The forged documents are printed on the ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free of charge: each of the migrants in hopes of making it easier for them to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That's two and a half times the amount of an official test: it's going to become migrant workers of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to ensure that the system is not corrupt, so that workers cannot simply buy evidence, in this way government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time, the time it takes to complete the course of the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where no active human interaction is required.
MVD (Ministry of Interior) does not take illegal arms market into circulation
The share of offences using legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Interior of Russia is proposing to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the response of government authorities to recent events: the launch of shootings at weddings that went by without victims and the massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which to obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarovja, who promised that changes to the weapons law would be presented to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of "screw-backing".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand rejection of the "inadvertent tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in a conversation with the Russian BBC editor.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed in six months 2012 using firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior, while 1,168,000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil arms legislation will not force the perpetrators to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon at a low cost can be found in Moscow at present.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Barañec, who worked for ten years at the offices of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept weapons orders
The first of them is "arms or military journeys", which means a weapon that was stolen during the Caucasus fighting.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves," Barañec says.
Another type of "black weapons" is weapons stolen by criminals in the security forces.
Barañec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from officials of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are made available for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires were deliberately founded - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
They bring their contribution according to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers.
"At present, private arms companies are created that are not competitive on the international market, and they are discharge weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are produced here in small production, and there was a mafia that organized their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supply on the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists reviewed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data on public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are listed by researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "the guilt of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons of armed conflict originated in 14% of cases of weapons theft during their manufacture, 5% was "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms dealers who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeologists" have long since been bought - are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers drive for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
The lieutenant buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You'll order a gun with him and he'll sell it to you over the fence.
"He will take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros for a piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good at painting, and that is why whenever a plan begins to burn them in clarifying crimes, they will conduct a check-up purchase with traders with illegal weapons," the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers usually find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited the website and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Test" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to "the corner" where we would act together.
I learned the prize all the way there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Barañec
If I'm going to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, a salesman-adviser. - I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically, "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to make sure my daughter fell out of her tooth."
And now I'm going to get through a man I'm sure of.
He's also going to deliver them to me because he knows I'm not going to cheat on him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Barañec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 90 ’ s when he worked for a publication on this subject.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Barañec, does not offer a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the seller into the woods and we're going to build a target.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I see that the gun shoots well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
The tray on the sofa.
Search engines will bring you to the web site and groups on "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"Just have a fixed amount of money," says an advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
On these pages, users leave their notices and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course not licensed," the user "Ivan" is asked (the rule is retained).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a huge network of crowded websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can pick up a shovel.
People pile up like hungry fish on bait and then get coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military officer Viktor Barañec
I have heard of such schemes: web pages are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response to this, the seller sends him a photograph and a description of the instructions where the gun is hidden," says NGO spokesman Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Barañec confirms that after you place your order on the website, you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently blew up a huge network of crowded websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can pick up a shovel.
"People flock like hungry fish to bait and then they get coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
If you buy illegal firearms, you will normally pay from $100 to $900, according to expert estimates.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to the Gun" you'll get the Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon shall be dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the Central Article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the January - October 2011 period, accounting for 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fastfood and supermarket workers strike in the United States
There'll be a quarter of all American teenagers working at the "McDonald" box office.
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", " Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole stock is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries paid by regular workers in Walmart and in fast refreshment systems, it is the aim of the organisers of the protests to achieve the creation of them in their trade organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when cheap sales orgy hit America, caught millions of residents, and in some cases were accompanied by robberies.
On this day, some Walmart employees, who work worldwide for 2.2 million people, left their workplace and demonstrated together with the unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies of commercial chains whose goods are destined for lower and middle class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy at their place of work.
The availability and variety of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because he barely pays his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of automatic wheelchairs or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" protesters demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 per month.
Typical worker Walmart gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't correspond to the cost, say employees.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is on average 1.1% more than this company is currently paying.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully on the consumer’s shoulders, each sales visit will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend roughly $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries, and society should not do virtually any harm.
The "Black Friday" in company stores lasted from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its treasury was conducted on "Black Friday" by nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left hand-focused Huffington Post website that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all over the "further media sensation" organised by the unions.
"An unoccupied treasure!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's commercial houses (they in that progressive city are not much to like, and that is why they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you in sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
He currently makes minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York $7.25 an hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wages, but only slightly, and on average, their number of employees in New York earn $8.90 an hour.
In this precious city, no one has lower wages.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school for part-time and live with their parents will attend "McDonald".
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there long enough.
At the present time, I constantly meet with "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Forum, there is a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs in fast food companies start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that union organizations be established in the field of fast refreshment.
The U.S. laws prohibit the administration from defending the establishment of trade organisations and punishing union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also complex for objective reasons to establish a trade organisation in business quick refreshments.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
I beg to differ.
On this day there were also loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of that event was at the "McDonald" assembly near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians took place, especially a member of the city council of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
Demonstrators also awaited the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor candidate Billa de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fastfood workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which everyone deserves from the New Yorkers!"
As the New York Times reported, it was the greatest event of its kind in American history of fast refreshments.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were fast food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
If this event becomes a spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement, it is not clear yet.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern technologies virtual reality is a popular topic of expanded reality; lately it means to perceive the world particularly through the fries of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented a working model for this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also submitted a request for a relevant patent.
From an interview with the leader of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft Sharam Izadim's Cambridge Laboratory, it is clear that for scientists in this company, glasses are in the past.
It is easy to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a frame of reference what your research group is doing?
- We're dealing with the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, most of all touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all there is a very interesting option to manage using gestures.
What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system transferred interactions to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output current has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it's not appreciated?
- Surely he can't be regarded as an ally - the question of privacy arises, because we don't always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project to control facilities in public places, where we thought about gestures, but not smart ones, just such small, short ones.
The gesta would not be filmed by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to bracelet size.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the user to adjust to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual bonding.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately determine human reactions.
For example, laser sensors, which provide relatively good deep resolution, can be very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like the matrix and the depth.
With current perspective, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the distinction in axes X and Y, but also Z.
So it's very important that the speed, the number of images per second, is also very important.
The human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flow 30 images per second are frankly a little bit short, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need that much touch, but I need some pictures in a second extra.
- And increasing the number of cameras isn't necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - it's actually a normal sensor of the visible band.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the required volume of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curve of the camera location and see how it will help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that as far as the everyday use of advanced reality technology by special glasses is concerned, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "transferable" form of expansion of reality when it would be possible to switch from cloud to smartphones, projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time also weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
His hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that's the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think adding to the physical impressions could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks - using the other hand as a certain kind of background for displaying is used.
Excellent way to record compressions!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding materiality to these "images in the air" - for example the interference of a few directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, causes a tangible feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your tummy fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve ending in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at some point when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time – how to attract a person who is physically located in a very narrow space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically endless space – we are also working on the concept of track lines (not like in clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If lying to the brain becomes a goal, it is work for many years to come.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the beginning.
Tusk instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrograd avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge of it, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the painting scene of St. Petersburg, whose ornaments exceed the city's borders, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the universal vote.
The new hero of "Rosbaltu" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is fully dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion pubs and at the scaffolds.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical historians of petrohrad, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a prominent man of the petrohrad avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Besides being a city man, his appearance on the streets gives rise to smiles on the faces of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a petrohrad bottler because he matured into this complex role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town in red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with view and image.
In this world, there is a red color compromise between the artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that anything that differs from gray is aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That was when the waves of old free unofficial artists crossed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonov who led us to "Pushkinska 10", and there were no other waves.
It draws me to theatre, dress, music, to all genres except the word.
- And that all happened in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be in the centre of the peterburg culture, where all the best creative powers should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a place on Pushkinska 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, home of the peterburk bohem.
There were many births: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura was brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
The cord and his friends sang under the lap of a light song, dressed in adjacent tricots, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has run many programs of halli-galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", Club "Griboyedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests went.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something else.
In 2000 the survey was conducted in print, the special price was "People in our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was appointed, which ended my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are recognizable.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits that capture current and insight.
I'm going to have a program show on "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, being that way today is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything gets messed up, there's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian disguises in the order of command.
Today, people meet according to clothing, they focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand, and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- We saw you recently as a city bottler. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should they be if not me?
- And could commercial art be beautiful?
At present, commercial, beneficial art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a decay of cultures.
In the past, people used to meet in silence, and God loved one another, just the other people.
Today everything has broken down on the microcommunity, and today it's very hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar banknote to be liked by everyone.
Today you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans of his own.
- And several thousand viewers are coming to the Mikhail Stas!
He's got fans coming to him, and there's a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land, and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything gets wasted.
I've got fans, the main thing is, no one's gonna cheat on them, and they won't break what's been experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse their notions.
They say:Cultural culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, that's different.
I'm a man of culture last day, and I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Pettierburg?
- Good experts for culture.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper emperors it was not so in everything, the emperors may not have understood the culture too much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in a corner, because there's a need for great experts to properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today he thrives on taste.
The same Erarta, but it's different because they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What do you think peterburk is?
- Peterburk - it's not the capital of culture, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our eel art is getting miserable.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
There are many people in Europe who are curious who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
With us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented under the St.Peterburg grant
Born in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with landmen on board are on their way, looking for an alternate planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: How can you keep your family under conditions of burdenlessness or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ).
But while there are better living conditions on Mars, they reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It is possible to live there only in great height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the questions of reproduction in the universe scientists began with flora.
Attempts on plants were made six months ago.
Four generations of peas grown on the orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was taken to orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, it was sent to the universe to test how an embryo develops in a state of ease.
We're getting an absolutely normal bird on the way out.
But then trouble starts.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find resistance, must stand up on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the Biomedical Problem Institute (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find resistance, birds fall chaoticly and make cotmelettes.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds have become completely extinct instincts.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"We had the birds hatched twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" of the animals flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will be only one-sex beings.
There was an experiment with rats that were broadcasting into space already gravitative.
They didn't actually find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellite, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be made," Vladimir Sychev said.
After landing on earth, the offspring were born with cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when losing their normal environment.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rule with abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkov's greatest danger.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if he could make the flight to space.
Is she capable of giving birth to a child after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," said the rocket-space veteran Vachtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereškovová daughter was born.
The father of the child was also the astronaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988 the son of the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savička was born, who visited orbit twice and also worked in the open universe.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who have been born for many years and a growing offspring of health.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital years," says the astronaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia Valerij Poljakov.
Yet, mankind must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, astronauts adopt the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water mimics the state of burdenlessness.
For adults, water is a comfortable, but in its own strange environment, it is a natural life for young children.
The small gouts seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the average 9 months in the mother’s fruit water and the fact that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, only two weeks will pass.
"It is very little for a child to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In short - if the condition is more natural for a newborn child, then for women there is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In the state of weightlessness, it is very fast to fertilize the abdominal muscles, muscles of the pelvis, and the body’s ability to fertilize.
This can be left aside if muscle stimulaters work in childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism releases the fetus.
"What else?" asks Valerij Poljak's complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by natural attraction, it cannot properly form a structure or muscle system.
Newborns on the orbit are not able to dress as adults in a special suit with a weight in which they can train.
He will simply be saved from what he needs unconditionally for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will admit the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring on Earth a disabled person who will be completely unsuited to the environment," the head of the bioethics committee IBMP RAN Igor Pestov predicts.
So the development of children in the universe today is just a theoretical issue.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the earthlings will go on their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the NKKU: Security control failed to blame politicians
In connection with public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and good quality legislation, but it is not in its application.
In an interview for Aktualna.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct application - that is what I think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also suggest joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nečas's approach to the so-called "schwartz system" is cited.
Mr. Prime Minister said recently that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with his controls - is he banned or permitted?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, neither the Prime Minister nor the President of the Government can prevent the action of the office, which is obliged to control and enforce obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was that all about?
It's a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, is followed by individual national legislation and then also by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and even though the control is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps " tighter and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to address the application of the law itself.
In fact, what can this project do for you, and what does it do for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price in order to avoid enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit on contracts, we do not necessarily have to achieve it.
Maybe the system will be filled with such a lot of paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to draw more easily from it than if the limit stays higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the translation of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our NKU, or is it different?
As far as authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized in the same way as we are, has a college, is just a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are doing the same.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but Germany has a federal arrangement, so these Courts also have at the level of individual federal countries - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control federal money presented by state funds.
Public funds managed by regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of the Courts of Common Accounting.
As far as the legislation is concerned, it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is described as a model, but it cannot be said that everything is better.
Is it also necessary that they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As far as the domestic legislation, which meant a amendment to the Public Procurement Act to your office, is there any way that it has its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novelty is relatively short, we do not yet have it in our control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
We are watching this so far only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool of "detecting the risk of negligence", through which we have driven up almost 14,000 public contracts, and analyzed them - there will naturally be changes in the limits, the conditions of some types of tendering will be adjusted and similar.
Therefore, do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or another burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
A problem that may arise here is that it will tighten up the rules and will not be able to keep them.
For the functioning of the previous rules, checked persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is the law thus worth tightening?
I don't think that's the way it is.
The system must rule out those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who allow formal doubt that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
Mr. Prime Minister said recently that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "schwartz system" - and what does that mean?
Is the schwartz system banned or authorized?
The law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, neither the Prime Minister nor the President of the Government can prevent an office which is obliged to control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and we let it happen," but he can't say we're gonna do anything like that.
In the Public Procurement Act there are relatively strict rules as to what is to be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the correct application - that's what I think is missing.
The roads are frozen, but mostly congested.
The roads are frozen and also snowed in several places in the Czech Republic.
Most of the time, though, the cars are downhill somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovyak Region
In the region of Karlovyka this morning the roads were paved, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but is to be slightly warm during the day.
The snowfall in the region has been fixed and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Crush Mountains, however, is about 30 centimeters snow.
The places were also less visible due to the fog, resulting from data on the control of regional road drivers.
Speed roads R6 and first-class communication are now borderless in the region.
Caution is, of course, on the spot, for example, in some overcrowdings where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also transitory.
However, in some sections there are still remains of frozen snow and snow.
Above all, increased attention should be paid to driving in higher positions.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký kraj
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a frost, in higher positions, and in the mountains there can be an encroached layer of snow on the communications, informing on its website the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
The motorists warn drivers against frost, especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
In the vicinity of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
The snow is especially on roads in Krkonoše and Orlické Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžno and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to half-clear without collisions.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a faint wind.
Plzeňsk Region
Roads in the Plzeň region this morning are circumstantial, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing after morning, temperatures are between three and nine degrees below freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The seats must also count with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This results from information provided by the regional roadmasters.
D5 is almost boundless, however, the communications administrators recommend increased caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tahovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second and third-class communications are wet and also in this case alerts to frozen sections apply.
Drivers should be careful especially on less frequent roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomoucic Region
With snow mush on the road they must now count drivers heading to the highest locations of the Olomouc Region.
After a chemical rash, she remained in the Red Sea saddle and on her way to the Villian Cross.
Engineers forced the snow into the terrain at night, and in Shumpersk, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimetres.
In other parts of the region, the carriages are usually free of restrictions.
"In Shumperska lies the highest snow remains.
With snow oats on the Red Cross, drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník," the CTC traffic control dispatcher said today.
At night, their colleagues also went to Jesenick, and the roads to the highest positions are now said to be bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouck, roads are boundless, but in Šternbersk drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the coaches remained wet.
Usteký kraj, Liberecký kraj
Immediately, several difficult points of descent are reported today after the morning by roadmen in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow hit or with glaciers, mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice on Ústecka are closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are held under zero in lower positions, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, and roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of the glacier is reported mainly by roaders from around Štětě.
According to meteorologists, it was the perfect conditions for her at night - during the day of rain and melting snow, at night clear and cold.
Unfavourable conditions are also reported from the main moves on the I/13 road at the border of Ustecké and Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnica to Knínice was forced by bending branches of trees, which bent under the snow to the carriageway.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other threatening messages that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it, and we say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to put the end of the world away or prevent it.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national benefit we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th, from 21 hours, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at a time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was probably my idea, and then we invented everything together with our artist Honzo Augusta.
In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world is once passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World overturned".
Is it very popular on YouTube today, too, at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in complete conclusion, if we don't succeed and the end of the world...
She's being sung by all the artists at all three concerts at the same time.
The hymns will suddenly also be connected in a unique direct transmission to Czech TV.
The words to this song are written and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tomáš Hanák, also by Xindl X...
How did you get together with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we are hosting a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turns out most of them are interested in and amuse.
What's the benefit from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Barrier-free Study Centre, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Tap Civil Association at Jedličk Institute.
Teachers regularly come to the school students Jedličko’s Institute and are dedicated to them in activities that interest them and interest them.
Students alone don't have the resources to go on their own as teachers, so we try to enable them to do so.
As part of the construction of the Jedličk Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and artists will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We've been trying to put together a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning similar "bombastic events" to the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in the Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the US, would like to associate this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimal, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is however a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as terrible as it looks.
We have five members in an electric cart, her carts must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we are hauling a lot of cargo and a box of tools...
However, so far it has always worked out without problems, the ČSA and the British Airways have been great prepared to see how many times I've been surprised.
Even in Moscow, which we returned from recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how different individuals are in barrierlessness, public access to handicapped and similar.
What have you met before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than with us, we have just witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its full start.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a man on an electric cart to move himself in the center of the city.
There's no such thing as a lift ticket.
Fortunately, civil society is already in the process of raising awareness about the problems of people with disabilities.
On what else do we still have to catch up with the more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid it is quite common that even people with severe handicap move in public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, wherever...
But it is not uncommon for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life, on the contrary, with The Tap Tap in front!
Respect for the public or barrierlessness is one thing, but only at a time when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will change, things will change for real.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap Band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years to what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at Jedlick's Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I started an interesting music ring with a colleague.
And in the course of time, as our moderator Lada Angelovich calls us, it's gotten a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the band.
We figured out that the work that we couldn't see was basically like it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal of reaching out to The Tap Tap that high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I daresay Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering all the abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole society.
What helped this success, too, is that you are a strict boss, as many people have identified you?
When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many ways and demand a certain discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the exam twice a week, they come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, their enthusiasm will quickly abandon them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were in her early years in 1998?
Only one ship, Angelovich.
We're an open group, people go and come, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has a door open with us.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00 p.m.
Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Plynoi will take place in Prague with 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the night, all three cities will be joined by telemass with the singing of the band The Tap Tap Tap "The End of the World overturned"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at Jedličk Institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free tickets in the presale of Bohemiatikket
Polish and space.
In the past week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency as the second member of the former Eastern bloc (in the Czech Republic to become a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's path to space had already begun much earlier.
For years Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomic Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering space.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltrie and André Louis Hirscha prize in France.
The famous Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of spacecraft and his contribution was also appreciated by one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon named by his name.
In 1925 a railway train was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to disembark the wood or to block it.
The information on this weed is known only from time-old printing.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to target rockets.
Research was carried out by the Chamber of Techniky Armed Forces in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslav Wolfk and Professor Gustav Mokrzyckyegim.
From preserved materials it is obvious that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric missile, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press and in the following year the work of the Rocket - air torpedo and the rocket bomb of the air carrier author Lelih-Krzywoblock was released.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory Committee), which coordinated all the work, was dedicated to all projects of military use of rocket technology.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ended the start of the war.
Another work devoted to spacecraft after the war in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautic Society).
For the first time, there is a reference to a company in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, which contains four major articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotovich, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with space.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already under way, and it was clear that space exploration was a perceptive field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (found in 1951) and has already become a proper member of PTA in autumn.
And in the following year the first PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function lasted until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (The Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with access to 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket tests were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was four feet long, and its weight was about six pounds [11.5 kg].
Another development type should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have access up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962 further developments were suspended.
The first RM rockets were followed by a meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A, space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 there was the development of the Meteor-2 rocket at the Flight Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remk.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a live discussion in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is free trade and free movement of private capital, along with unconditional financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour price (beef) there is a price voltage.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer is seeking to stand in competition by importing cheap goods by "stressing" the price of the competitor in order to take on a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production into a foreign country, or to buy it cheaply, or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility, and thus the responsibility for which unemployment has been produced, there is an urgent need for social expenditure by the state.
The whole situation strengthens the total reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social harm they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known in general that no specific statistics need be provided.
The reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to the general public regardless of the social downturn.
This is especially evident in changes in the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force the population to adopt a price decree for private capital in particular in the area of wages.
This is the case, however, with the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, but also with the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
In SRN there have been a number of years of public food for the poor, who cannot feed on their own work.
The number of these people goes back to millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is common for properly employed people to receive such remuneration that they must be paid to an existing minima.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary members of the Federal House.
The austerity measures of virtually all of the EU's southern states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in the social level are either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live on hunger wages on the edge of society in the hope that private investment will eventually reach the country.
But where does he come from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty from one country to another will move or will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, or the Egyptians, or Africans are still working for a fraction of European wages.
That's what Latin America is all about.
The liberal theory and the media argue that it is impossible to become a capitalist on its own economy that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital of the holding insists that the State must not intervene in the economy by managing the intervention.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, in fact, it is now governing politics and thus the whole state in its own egotistic sense.
Here's a clear answer, yes.
The evidence is virtually omnipotent and in all the states of the present lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where everything is practically criminal, but nothing criminal.
In SRN, the situation is such that the State Departments for Lack of Funds issue drafting laws to private law firms, which are heavily linked to industry.
These bills are then agreed by the Bundestag.
This is not how it comes from people as Western-type institutions report it, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberalally oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes in his work of the Crisis of the Republic of Rome in Caesar and Pompey: "The State has long been in complete decomposition and the authorities have been filled with violence.
For bribes, for illegal gain of prizes and for use of stones or swords.
The bribes and corruption were without any restriction, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice" "...character people did not care at all about the office, so that once the result of this disorder was to stand for eight months without the consuls" ..."It began to speak of the fact that the only cure in the bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to elect an energetic man." Appianos, though he was thinking of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed to permanent democracy to self-government.
As in antiquity, the present company is based on an unwarranted advantage of its own benefit, irrespective of the collective interest.
Private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the general benefit of society.
The result is now, as well as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper sense.
We must therefore seek the cause of the appearance of fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalisation of the 19th and 20th centuries economic systems.
In the current state, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy may be considered a break with the expectation of another round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites are totally ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives losses, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under competition pressure both internationally and internally, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solutions are targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the State's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come of violence, and never can" Sting in Fragile's song whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no" dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a number of reactions were born.
Some stand for Israel, argue its right to self-defence and the Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue against racism in the Israeli state, genocide in the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who in the recurrent waves of killing the guilty person is and who, after all, the victims of today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government territories, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer the readers a view of the tire, a view of who has been served primarily by 95 years of tension (calculated since Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of modern history events.
Human history is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who have completely autonomously guided their steps and or whether there has been someone behind their throne who has directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must accept that we are living at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not come into existence in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered the head of an octopus (if someone still stands above them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - the Rothschields.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of their name with the highly criminal acts in which they stood behind and for which they were always meant to strengthen power, to increase wealth or both.
The main stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank do not run or prepare wars (before the attack by Afghanistan was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to deny this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began issuing his own (understand the government's) money during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was assassinated in 1963, Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars for the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pik.
The first war was the task of removing large monarchist states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule in particular of Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to between 0.5 billion and 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are sufficient and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude to such solutions) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in charge of Rothschielda is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED in order not to reverse the crisis like the one they caused in 1907).
So after they succeeded in murdering the Habsburg follower of the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, they destroyed the Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly, militarily and economically unfounded, with Germany's surrender (no longer needed war to destroy the Imperial Russia) and then there was a fragmentation of Central European power, Austria Uherska.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the politicians allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation by placing huge war reparations on Germany, creating a presumptive radicalisation of debilitating masses, and then simply putting the Germans in a strong enough position, the culprits marking and the simple solution of the offering leader and the further creation of multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, at the time of the outbreak of war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's already mentioned declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, starting with the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler broke out of the chain on which the international bankers initially held him or all he had done was to be difficult to estimate, however, the suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, like Germany's war reparations, earned on World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created a third outbreak of war.
If it is managed by international bankers, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the first-line victim, now with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of squalor and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (let's just say that people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice results in an endless chain of violence when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power was at the beginning of all?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers urge people to choose in elections solely their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, international bankers of loyalty, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to turn into a global conflict and, in view of the control of Iran over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all the world's oil (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in their image is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a completely controlled entity.
"And he compels all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on their right hand or at the head of others, that they may not buy or sell who is not named after the beast or the numeral of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who's got the sense to count the numbers of the beast.
That number represents a man, and it's number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he captured 52 diplomats as a hostage to demonstrate Islamic students at the American Embassy in Tehran.
They were to be released in exchange for the decommissioned Shah of Mohamed Réz Páloví, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it would thus significantly undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages.
The diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were negotiated by the Algerian government.
Their share at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Nazi sentiment.
The debate in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's 1980 presidential election with Ronald Reagan.
The film directed by Ben Afflecka Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Six employees fled the embassy just before it was filled.
After complex peripetes, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while an extravagant cover story helped - they went to Canadian bands as members of the film staff, who in the country viewed locations for shooting sci-fi big film.
The combination of genres
The plan that invented the expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
For the legend to be credible, it was a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film comes from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflec's movie is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time called "caper speech", a story of a successful piece, a clue - an example can be the series of Danny's partners.
This is how moods change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary sequence of Tehran (in the title sequence shows iconic time photographs of events and the way the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, a relieved passage from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight oversupply.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in clothing are discussing the situation at the table, in the halls of the office, in the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to re-start his career in a remarkable way.
From a mocked act he became a respected director and his acting stopped being a target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Afflek's picture that is not being played in the director's home Boston.
The quote for the atmosphere of the places was among the characteristics that the directors' older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Arg where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time facilitates the emotion of confusion and unsurprisingness that arise when history is clearly moved.
Similar effects are achieved by Affleck and his associates in the scene of the fictional (false headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story he told does not actually offer power in the film sense of intense scenes.
He's working pretty well with it, and sometimes he thinks of reality -- everything doesn't get so elegantly out there anymore (a scene in which the threatening crisis at the Tehran airport turns the call back in America and the chase after the rave is doing a lot of hair-skinned work).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the infuriation resulting from the need to show too much history in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood associates, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not the only ones in the film.
Afflect's film kind of loses its dramatic move, it's a picture that can be watched with a slight interest, to appreciate the realization of the retro style of evolutionary thrillers in the 1970s.
But it won't be easy.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and proof of the exaggerated notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, it will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankingcharges.com, which publishes a survey each year on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to issue a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law organizer of the survey Patrick Nacher.
For example, there is already a recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance rates for men and women.
To date, women have benefited from life insurance since they are objectively less risky for insurance undertakings.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulation also calls for the mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuel, which is causing damage to nature, and it also prohibits the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the hens, which has greatly exposed the eggs this year.
Criticism has also previously faced a factual ban on the use of the expression anointing butter or removing classic bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a business or industrial lobby whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a State or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now and by threat of veto enforces the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby also stood because, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach at least 14 cm in length and should not have reported "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising existing divergent national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened, through resistance from some countries, the evidence that the existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the poll may also be the EU regulation last year, which requires that the children under the age of 8 should not be inflatable without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to American research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children to strangulation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when they blow into the desert’s crouches.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is rather absurd, however, for European officials themselves - everyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name FYROM instead, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece.
In cooperation with the association of liberal economies, Laissez Faire nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the above, the EU Regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum quantities of food supplies which could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volume in the preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers also took the idea of paying some countries for having no sea, and the idea of granting grants on a grant application.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're being held by the fact that we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palace (ČSSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that we had a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases he had to be filled with warehouses that he had to export.
The EU, according to the Palace, should pay hundreds of millions of euros for keeping the Czech Republic away from the ports.
The European Commission finally came up with the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to the local development ministry managed by Minister Pavl Němec (US-DEU) was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, in particular, to go to write down the application for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the Regulation is easily targeted in Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to function more effectively and develop the Union as a whole are more recognizable, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, for example, according to experts, is the drawing on of EU grants for projects that have neither a sign of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic and the other countries of the Union also arouses the fact that the Czech Republic in Brussels must fight for the right to specific designations of its traditional products, and not always succeeds in this match.
Even after a six-year fight with the Germans and Rakakans, the Czechs followed the designation of the Olomouc shapes, but the local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed native by our producers.
The designation of rum may only be carried from cane distillate, not sugar beet.
The official EU list of registered products included world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Germany's Lübeck or parm hams, for example, Karlovyiel’s cheeses, Porelician and Tribenik capr, as well as the Žatechmel.
The EU's trademark can then also be proud of the Pardubite feather and the combustible tube.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says.
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
I don't mean to be a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not going anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been stealing from the country for the last 20 years, how the thieves have been running, how people have been taxed and how long they have retired.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I was 40 years old and an independent non-partner, I have no choice but to influence things rather than run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but then you went to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All the time, I said I'd go to the Battle of the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
Later, I stated that if I was elected Senator, I would run for President.
My goal, however, is not a function, a function is a tool, how I can perform my visions.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible.
But the problem is not only that we are giving as a nation in a pub and in television, but that we are going to slap anyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media, which dehonizes a person and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I may have been told that I was paying off journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go to your visions.
You went to battle for the Castles with the heavy and criminal liability of politicians and property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
As president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was lobbying for free trade as a citizen, it was possible to enforce it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or to the right, he says no, and it keeps citizens.
As an independent non-partner, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, on each side and apply it.
Do you rather consider yourself a right-wing person or a left-handed person?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are giving me a left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KICM or ODS, and I will also oppose the wrong idea.
You're damn if someone says you're a populism.
But can't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some might call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with only passwords.
And you're not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them that you will be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility, for example?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push it.
If I am elected President, there is no problem in organising television direct transmission, where I will ask Parliamentary Presidents to legislate substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And maybe they'd have to tell us why they don't want her.
If there is a strong personality that will name nuisances, it can be pushed into the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, it was a merit of public pressure.
On the level, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
In politics, I've just started, and I'm going to try to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything in one person, so I've been going around a lot of famous people to see if they'd go to the Senate as well.
I went to Radim Jancura, who refused for a lot of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenzo, who exposed the frauds with light oil.
I've been running with people who are really unhappy, but now I'm on the ropes.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the polls, and those who went mostly chose the representatives of the establishment.
We're only two independents in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate to make changes difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or straight men.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential client, and I don't have the money for it either.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign. There's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skodu Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked the James Bond who rode in the car, was gallant to the women and also fought the bad things and the bad things.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million dollars and you don't have any money to campaign?
You're saying you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money in it too much.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
You want me to owe you that?
I've already hit 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that I'm not interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign out of my own.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover the way I'm going to receive the senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not going anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
But that doesn't have anything to do with pay.
As promised, I have partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my deputy will be my travel agent in springtime.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live off something.
How used to taking a month as a businessman have you been?
Two hundred to 400,000, I'll take it from here.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of the Law.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spiikenisse and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally it is to see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT tech in a nearby big business, he says, "Of course, this house is nice."
However, I ask what else we need the library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPads and electronic books.
None of these old - fashioned libraries are voluntarily entered today, are they?
Spiikenisse, a residence close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which are not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This community with 80,000 inhabitants exhibits the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was taken to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive was not inconvenient.
And so the city council learned that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of the insanely courageous column graphs and the makeer of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual tranquility and at the 2003 competition he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around and shivering its shoulders, the bold Maas carried out his gifts according to size and ended his proactively justified speech with the words "Dear Town Hall!"
So this is my proposal on the Mountain Book in Spikenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain was completed.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and private homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was named the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town gray which could not yet offer more than a postmodern walking zone and an unusually ugly town hall for which the white facade of which you would rather expect a dairy is a richer by a bit of a modern architecture.
But above all, Spiikenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under the hatch on the cheese.
Although the lift rides through the mountain massif, you will find real spatial and readeral passions only when walking through topography.
On all sides the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning cab and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally standing racks with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is mostly incompetent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and put the reader space out.
Intruk Hory books is cleverly used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home techniques.
A special comfort is the black shelves on books, which are one layer of walls, one parapet, and the other with the railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure and odour of the alien species.
Even architects and construction engineers will be sworn in over unknown construction material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town municipality of Spikinisse, on a request from Standard magazine.
So one day in a French farm, we encountered a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years now, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, it has been used as a basis under the roots of a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter.
It's cheap and time-effective.
A thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then it's ripe to dump in bulk.
For the library was rouno - for the first time in such quantity - written on boards with a thickness of four centimetres.
The effect of heat and pressure on so-called Landbowplastic (KLP) colores in dark, homogeneous and heavy material, which smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
You'll get to the top after 105 steps.
At the end of almost 500 metres of long journey, you will be awarded not only a fantastic view of the city but also of Dutch croquets and figurines in flowering plants.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the right humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project on ecology," Trouborst said.
It melts and cools with earth's heat.
Although the Mountain books stand under a glass lid, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden vases, which are right next to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sun’s radiation.
The air conditioning in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial scepter from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as "the long-awaited soul" Spikenisse.
Reason: Every city dweller was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This was the first time that optical gaps had been filled in the not completely equipped library, which currently accounts for 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, now every resident has a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of an identity in the professional jargon.
Spikenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the decision to adopt Palestine.
According to US-Europe expert Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany initially indicated that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must now be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll even support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without however being too critical of Israel.
Germany also abstained during the uprising in Libya in March 2011 when it came to establishing a flightless zone.
That's where NATO finally failed.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear view of serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy in the direction of a policy that was so governed by the United States towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're only settling in their role, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
To foreign politics they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to engage in national interests and attitudes independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, namely export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other powers and therefore must protect Germany’s interests.
Were economic interests affecting the position of the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
First of all, Germany has a large resort in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but neither the elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it's a role.
But I wouldn't want to attribute too much importance to it, it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany's relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from voting in the event of both important decisions, such as when voting on Palestine?
I think there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States for the German stand.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a fracture as it was in Libya.
I hope Germany can even earn some respect.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the US has made it clear for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always been due to American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government seems to have a strong understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, stand public.
I think that differences of opinion are really not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to bring its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, it would be a little easier if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they cannot be part of a wider line, and they must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and will push Europe to take a European stand.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany assumes a greater role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently fulfilling this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is a sign behind this, which is completely officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection for as long as the actual brand owners do not sue them.
And even then, it's not clear whether the law is in place.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in violating security rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few extra letters are enough for counterfeiters to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way also German companies, such as the manufacturer of the sport goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch is opening the organizer of the sign-up office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trade brand Zegna DF Puma. An art name that also parasites at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are multi-storey houses where counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Patloch’s cases are different. From the commission of his mandate, he is moving against Chinese companies to receive from the mark office the full official right to use the mark, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts business, we have to fight it," Patloch urges.
"The mark is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market in the year.
However, the removal of questionable records in the register of marks can be difficult to achieve and it costs something.
Driving can last up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Patloch reports cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the name in question became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
When the prosecution has bad luck, he has to pay the plagiarist more because he damaged his brand in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes there's a jungle law around here.
Other cases include graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over German pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese, therefore, are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
A manufacturer of Lacoste fashion goods lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who have turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO’s landmark office admits that in 2010 there were shortcomings due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, allegedly, "the process of work has returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet, 81,500 complaints remain pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China, which comes with a list of new applications all over the world.
This is also true for the number of valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were selected for fees.
Simply put, this means that each application on average costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Many times, the case of the German family company Freudenberg has proved against it.
This company has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand further.
We would have warned ourselves because in Germany the last name could not be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialists in Munich.
The CTMO landmark office also rejected the opposition of the monk company.
Although Freudenberg was granted rights in the other two instances, the challenger still struggles to this day.
You need to be careful.
Now the matter is discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The drive is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archive companies even had to look at a hundred years old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered in vain a "high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what this means to us," says Wentzler.
It also threatens to affect Europe from the Far East.
And that's in case the impersonators get unprotected stamps there.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign up for Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This business area gave up the company long ago, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
"Be careful," says Wentzler.
He and Patloch counsel the German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything in any way worth protecting, register even in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he may have to pay the license fees on his own name counter-partyly, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: assortment, singing, aid
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation is trying - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who died on AIDS are happy to do so.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's assification: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins looking on the floor tact and quickly finding it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly they lift up the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, mom and each other are pursuing.
A 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopfa, almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he combines voices with his wildly wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi's choir is testing a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher on human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each congregation voice has another text and also in a very foreign language - a Zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
The United Nations AIDS programme, Unaids, estimates that there are some 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of that, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died on AIDS.
HIV is already positive for over 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died on AIDS, the village of Esitena found the Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronage can be taken over by 15 or 20 euros per month.
He guarantees a child a school uniform and a warm meal daily in Gogo-center.
Imbongi means in the language of the Zulu "story teller" or "the one who celebrates".
There's no one in this room who can talk with gas bantustin, just sing.
For almost ten years, the congregation has been practicing songs in this foreign soft talk and sometimes also brings them back to where they originally come from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, the northern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland is the village of Esitena, which depends on the volume of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitena, it is visible in the small state of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of male foreskin, which visibly reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity within them, and there is no point in dying in less than 30 years.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005. Above all, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked only parental care, but cleaned everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school graduation, they don't have a chance in a poor country anymore.
At first, it was still a private setup of individuals who for a few euros each year enabled him to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the "Voices for Africa" association was established, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died on AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Lightning and itch belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who are the most affected groups?
Syphilis and the fungi occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha's Constitution is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilid reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (flavor), fungi and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of those newly infected with HIV appear to be in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections involve young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavir is common among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilid infections according to the Constitution of Robert Kocha has more than doubled in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms point to sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urinating, swelling, abdominal pain, and blisters or nipples.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore they will remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Dangers can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted with impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, in particular in the case of frequent alteration of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, most SPIs can be cured and later consequences prevented.
Thanks to the patronage, the charity, and, last but not least, the fees that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany will gather some money.
"We have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitán," said the president of the Annette Lennartz Society.
He manages money from Germany in the village of Zodwa Plumini, a confident woman who can argue.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, such as with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu is called to old women, are the resistance of the village.
Some of them married 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that their children arrived on time in school uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the company as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" set up a school of sewing, built two hens, and together with the American health organization PSI ensured that many people in the village were given a HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's strange enough in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King of Mswati III, is known for his restless lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame, among other things, for the spread of HIV in recent decades.
But there are also many migrant workers who have spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
In order to at least support the cultural exchange, Imbongi travels once every two, three years together after South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, war, confidence in the future and confidence of the black, which many in the southern tip of the Black continent know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the black language - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also has shed tears among many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitena, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than familiar in the valley of the river Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitina, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers from here to the asswipe singers at the Bergheimer Straße trial room, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA Discovered on Mercury Ice
The Messenger probe found evidence that there was ice on planet Mercury.
The ice blanket could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published by the professional magazine "Science" Thursday.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water appeared to come from comets or even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not let ice be found in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
Temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how water and other basic elements of life have gotten into other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, undetected earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images will be sent to Earth, a small window into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles the Sun around Neptune, Ceres is not according to the new concept of the International Astronomical Union 2006 "planet".
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the worse identifying are pink-coloured "newly dispersed" in the birth chamber of the stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists are unromantically calling it W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This changing heat of the dying stars has captured NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The veneer ring consists of material that the star embossed during the dying process.
In the giant nebula Trifid, which is 5400 light years from Earth, the new star comes from gas and dust.
The photo of the Galactic "Cough" was taken by Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The Starship of Playady, also called "Seven Sisters", is at night seen only with an eye.
But because of the telescope, the colors will be better.
The Milky Way Helix may appear to the observer in this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located 700 light-years from the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity with Earth's world brought out this nebula called North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photo is the origin of an unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to capture in full beauty up to infrared Spitzer telescope detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which, four and a half billion years ago, disappeared without a trace.
One of the biggest and sharpest images of Hubble's telescope: a whirlpool galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies are, according to their coloration, becoming real works of art.
The footage published by the European Southern Observatory shows several thousand light-years away the Trifid nebula in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triclonal), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this star family into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonoš, astronomers photographed the premonition of a cosmic collision: 400 million light years from Earth, with the wife of the nucleus of two flowing galaxies, and must inevitably come to a collision.
This birth of the star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who does not like technical shortcuts may call it South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's space telescope shows the cutting of the Iris nebula in the Cefea constellation.
This 1,400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, which is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starry nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, this star cloud, associated with Rosette's nebula, gives birth to new young stars, thousands of light-years away from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey and was used by Galileo Galileo a year later to observe the stars.
Ever since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The world’s largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope on the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In the American Arizona stands Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each with an average of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures on average 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to ease costs.
Yet, its diameter is about 11 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of cheap design: the telescope is provided with a hook in a high angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high increase in the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is compared to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Arecibu (Portoriko), scientists in space are searching for alien signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
With "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - searching for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who gives available its computational performance.
An observer of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
She's standing here, Vera Large Telescope, and she's honoring her name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large scope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is designed to be 42 metres full and composed of almost 1000 mirrors.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck’s telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the world’s largest by 2007.
They offer immediately two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory, which, apart from them, is looking into the universe and using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-meter diameter of the mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, Hubble’s space telescope provides us with the most important impressions of the universe.
The images of distant worlds provide us from 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - mainly for those who are residents.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The picture documents the latest preparations before launching the Kepler Space Telescope.
Space Telescope James Webba (JWST) will be launched first in 2018 into space aboard the Ariane missile5.
The primary mirror of the cosmic infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there's ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, since Messenger travels around this planet far closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

We can call the ride up Talysh a wild romantic.
The microbus sweeps the road with many corners along densely wooded hills, rough rivers and simple rural structures.
Everything's green and juicy, and it almost looks like we're in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the southernmost of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
There is a Caucasian ethnic group of Talyš, which is not well known, except for speaking perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani, and is experiencing a very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from the Soviet times, which is somehow inappropriate in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairy - tale wealth for which the land owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the intention of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Grand Prize of Eurovision in May - and we will have the festival of the world's oldest people next year," Fatulajeva said.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talyš from the area, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulajeva shows black and white photos.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a child.
However, Müslümov, who was said to have been 168 years old, was the controversial star of this museum.
Of course, there is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest person with the evidence was 122 years old, Müslüm’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulajev.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he said that he still had a daughter.
Was not Müslümov mistaken at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Maxe Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about flying people in Central Asia.
"At last many people of high age live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when Matrixes are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is, people in the Lerik area are experiencing Bible age very often.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many flying people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuleva Museum believes that this is a food thing.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of Talyshes who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily is so healthy does not seem to be very reliable from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, there is Rubaba Mirzajev.
In 97 years, it is still relatively young in this geographical range.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a buttermilk he's relentlessly lurking.
Under one roof there are eight people, including one of Mirza’s sons and daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
There are two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical abdominal glass "armad".
Mirzavy’s white teeth form a perfect line, hiding under a scarf a long dark blonde copy, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look and keep their color.
"I never used shampoo like that," Mirzajev says.
A month's pension is enough
She only ate what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
The worst was World War II.
But everything got better when the oar took over the "loved father" Gejdar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds weird from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not know the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham's oar.
Old people in Azerbaijan, at least they're not in need.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is on the current ratio of the payload, from which you can benefit well.
And maybe he's right and maybe Mirzaev's long-scrupulous son: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, they're cared for, and they're happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The defiled demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country’s deep disunity.
A sharp discussion is being made about a future institution based on Sharia law.
The President of Egypt didn't spare the floor.
We have to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular people.
All of them, still hopelessly disintegrated in confused opposition, fear.
Fear of the "God's State" of the Nile granted to the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he had temporarily limited the powers of the constitutional court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who is a doctor of the U.S. University in Southern California, really wants to save, doesn't have the Egyptians or the world clear in that.
Is the judiciary to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which have been approved in a 15-hour night marathon by the Chair of the Constitutional Assembly with the suspense of Islamists, are a part of the cause for concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "practice" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamists of this vague formulation and that the associated legal free space will be used to give a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least, the newly added paragraph sheds light on this: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult with the Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
That may not, but it may mean that the klerus will supervise legislation, which would bring about a de facto withdrawal of justice.
In the design of the constitution there are many things of interpretation
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the collapse of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal states, the State should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is formulated on the legal side in such an imprecise manner that, by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In an understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the hynobit or slandering the prophet Mohamed and his envoys.
The vague remains, however, what is shameful and how it will be prosecuted.
In the same way, the formulation that is prohibited is "insulting people".
In this case, is the President's cartoon or a joke on law enforcement experts?
The matter of interpretation, as many more in this proposal, which Mursí will submit for signature and will, according to his words, present "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of human voting.
"The revolution has returned"
In the past few weeks, opposition against too many Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at Tahrír Square on Friday evening in Cairo in unusual consolingness and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej stated that the constitution's proposal belonged to a "history dump".
Through the short news service, Twitter accused supporters of wanting to carry out "a coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition member Jasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian media quoted Chálid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brethren declared a risemonstration, but out of caution not on Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the second bank of the Nile before the Kahir University.
She was attended by many veiled women and Salafists who called out, "People demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Morsi, "Clean out the land," and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
Fighting for sovereignty over the symbolic city of Tahrír, where everything began, would likely trigger a state similar to that of the civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and supporters of the proposed constitution made themselves loud and clear.
Now it's time to leave the people at the polling stations to decide which way the country should go.
The majority is considered certain in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not exist once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is awarded by Hafize Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing before a court of law.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And the new constitution is not the word 'human rights' any more," complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"A place for the president to strengthen civil society to effectively cancel it," complains Sa'da.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which monitors the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge on him.
A protester on Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.

There is snow, a beautiful view - and in the air there is a pervasive smell.
Rakfisk is salty trout boiled in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are beginning to meet at a festival dedicated to what to say best, the most subtle food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavitity," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rackfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat little fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than a cancer," says Havard.
Drinking can break the smell.
I'll try a few bites.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish poured into airtight vessels with water and salt in autumn.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well-leavened, pulled out and ate, the senses no doubt became numb with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Noras were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large number of jobs, high wages and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who had been much richer recently than Norway, will stream to the country for work.
The cancer is viewed as something important, indispensable, even though a rather pervasive part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even though everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you nine pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often fails to get into global reports - and it seems that most people do so.
The name Andersa Breivika, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still being mentioned here.
Instead, the shooting is called "the event of July 22nd".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth is followed by the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," she says, when serving plates with a sunken coffin, our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, presents the prototype of Nordic prosperity.
We're, as they say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely wonderful.
We don't show up, we don't like showy.
Norway is handling its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse was throwing money away that they didn't have, the Norwegians had strings on their bag tightened.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat the Rakfisk," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow line for something to eat - I've had enough of this.
Such a salmon burger is something else and it's pretty juicy.
But tonight, there's a stinking fish back here.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where the Rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They're connected to live television, which has a butterfly moderator surrounded by a plate with a raccoon.
It's like Eurovision's singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls out of a chair, perhaps aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all the fishes.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a rough start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, he looks at Will Grant from the BBC for the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport to Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is crowded even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent them from getting to work, but to prevent protestors from approaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena, Nieto, will receive the President's sherbet and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a challenging task.
At the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, Mexico was doing well economically, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence," the President of Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the American president, President Pena Neto gained political experience as governor of his home state, Mexico.
The views of the new leader differ in his old homeland, the human and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens credit it with the development of tourism in the airport and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city after one of the new highways that Pena Neto has built. These motorways are a huge improvement against the lattice and bumpy roads that were once there.
The boards with its name also hang on the wall of the modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olivera Hernandez, state MP for the side of President Penn Niet, Party of the Institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PR party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Member Olver admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, many are expected inside the Enriqua Pena Neta.
And rejects the opposition's comments characterising the new president as a human being without substantial content.
He is a very direct man, very interested in the country's excellent vision.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a person who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not an impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the long streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Stuck under the highway ramps in much resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
Problems in the self-governance community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called to help deal with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially violent against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places along with a massive waste dump.
At the time Pena Neto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico City, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the killing of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Neto say that he failed to deal adequately with the problem of killing women in his office.
And in a worse case, his leadership is accused of shutting his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of the lucid neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me the photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were punch marks on it and the postmortem stiffness began.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there are so many mistakes and I warn you," he says.
The sherpa that the President of the Pena Neto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by a violent crime, and the new president has vowed that during his term in office, they will be his top priority.
"I hope he'll be the same president as he was governor," said a member of PRI Oliver in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about any mistreatment, says the military prosecutor
The D.A.'s trying to reverse Bradley Manning's allegations of mistreatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning is being treated harshly in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed out on many possibilities of complaining about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor May. Ashden Fein, during the cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with his unit officers during the nine months of liaison in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination that was carried out during the hearing on the proposal to reject the case against Manning due to the gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, passed the forms that the officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Prison, where he was held in a regime with an increased guard from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers of Manning asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was considered "excellent" and the overall treatment in the facility was considered "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though officers of Manning directly asked him how he was treated, Fein argued.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems were expressed orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be addressed but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and it did not necessarily mean that I did not mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about dealing with his person in January 2011 when he met with the commission assessing suicide thoughts, which he had expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime for suicide) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and the transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at the base of the sea infantry in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait, and one day he passed out because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the outside world was very challenging.
"My world collapsed only on Arifjan base, on the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, blanket, bellows, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face, when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint with Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the charges brought in the Thursday statement concerning the fact that after having been forced to sleep one night in her cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other co-conspirators in the morning count.
Manning said that when he was counting, he was not allowed to cover his cover.
On Friday's interview, Judge Manning stated that he had determined from the orders of his guards that he had a blanket to hide, to postpone, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer he wasn't dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said he could use the belt from his underwear or his bellies to hurt himself, but didn't do it.
Manning confessed that that night, his underwear and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the case of his conviction before a military court whose beginning is expected at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defence stated that Manning is planning to plead guilty to lower crimes and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the binding conditions as justified.
The Pentagon has stated that Manning has been kept in accordance with the provisions concerning all arrested persons held in connection with the maximum guard.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding the enemy, the illegal disclosure of information on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged with all counts, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the inadequacy they have.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it to the crowd, and I arrived in a room for an immigration agenda where I encountered a problem.
The spikes pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So I ended up with the Mexican American sign later.
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, you didn't have to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited President Obama's White House this week.
The program has had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is the same likelihood that the Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they are travelling to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trading block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Peña Neto vowed to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans have probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite half the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, the comments are everywhere.
So a minute after the United States representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you'll hear in Mexican press and between the elite complaining about how Americans are interfering with the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on a warpath.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relation to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and defeats in Mexico, people the country offers, and others it doesn't.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it seems, this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we now live an American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
Besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and see us as an inferior race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they'd never have left.
And now we would not be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally a member of the United States in her childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because the Mexicans understand more about who they are and the Mexican Americans do not like it.
Even though she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, a lot of Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of one.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have any roots.
In Mexico, he looks at us like Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unhappiness for how their family members were treated in a much nearer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of bloodshed suggests that every such failure is futile.
Among the common unnecessary expectations of who started it, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, by the majority of civilians, and by six Israelis. And for the first time, they fell missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring changed the old order, and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this could stop their deadly pathetic situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimism at present.
Even if the cease-fire closed on November 21st, the fighting this week strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the saddest and most humane corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is influenced by the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its entrenched rivals from Fatahu, a temperate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas’s leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the restored regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The people of Hamas say that the Islamic half moon around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the side/miles of Hizbollah reigns, through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism, can sit down Bashar Assad, until Jordan, where Hamas’s allies threaten kings.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel he changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most populous and difficult Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Hamas’s cousin, and his leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be expelled from Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardline advocates will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli missile system The Iron dome proved its price and many rockets to Hamas were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
And above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, Israel has been relatively at peace with suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian State may once be, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil the prodigal Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't fire missiles, like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them with their heads.
The hardline may win, but the Arab Spring can change their outlook.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have much in love, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israeli spending on defense is higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war on local superpowers will hardly help new Arab governments recover their economies.
President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to stop the fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates the denial of Palestinians' rights to self-determination by a court with gunpowder, which one day must explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics are making this situation worse as the Arab population grows.
Bloodbaths against Gaza, which take place every few years to suppress Hamas, will increasingly choose diplomatic taxes.
Both parties need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two states where Israel enters the territory for safety.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must be set to halt arms deliveries to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of a part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The Arabs from the outside must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has his work on how to get Israel to the table.
During his first election period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally frail in joining the process.
That's sadly shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws on Ugly Cigarette Packs entered into force in Australia
There are warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body on unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands.
Australian tobacco and cigarette laws, the first of their kind in the world, have entered into force, and brand logos and colors have replaced general olive green boxes with disgusting images of sick parts of the body and the sight of children and newborns sick as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the different health warnings and images, Saturday is necessarily the only difference between the box names, which are printed in the same small letter.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of its appeal.
It's based on studies that show that if people don't start smoking at the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"And for very young children you can see that it understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children link the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries consider taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry has strongly lobbyed against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will have serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgeries from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that demand for cigarettes from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal to laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hindrance, experts describe the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from direct viewing, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has prohibited Internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign pages.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you are left with only this small space for the promotion of your products, the online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, research worker in the field of public health at Sydney University.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in social networking marks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and put up his job and created this video, or is that involved by a marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia argues that the sector focused on how it applies to new regulations rather than marketing.
The branch went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is doing significant business.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that consider similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now more than 40 countries have expanded, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The images don't have any effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that because of the uniform boxes it is harder for him to line them up to the racks.
"It took me an hour to load, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should simply ban them completely, then we would say, 'OK, that's over, we close the shop'," he said and threw his hands at us.
In a world of constant connection it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for the next flight is quite annoying, despite distractions of books, magazines and iPhonem (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It makes the brain go in interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us today are constantly connected to some kind of screen, we don't have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we support boredom?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of the book Bored: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, a Latin inscription was found regarding boredom, from the first century of our Common Era.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After considering research literature and presenting the idea to the target group about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it".
Boredness differs from apathy by the fact that a person is not involved in anything, but wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything with apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the process of attention associated with the bad mood and the feeling of slow-driving time."
Boring can make a lot of sense of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, people who tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or binding task, the distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, it can distracting music to help you stay quiet."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and snorting, often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and maintain more information than those who are forced to sit quietly," said Professor Fenske.
We have all experienced boredom - the delay of my flight, a loudspeaker, especially a lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
In order to help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale".
The column includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at University of West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally inefficient.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent indicated that they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knew that "adulting is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to succumb to absurd physical risks, to gamble or to abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"The need is the way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is passed from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical about her, either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are from the reach of continuous crushing activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of having to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly restimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado
An 18-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a higher education and a footballer from Southeast Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - holding a few grams of marijuana and smoke that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day he went with several friends in Lamar, on plans near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was called in for drug possession and drug equipment - minor offences, with a fine of $100 - and was given a date for the trial.
"They treated us like criminals," Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana offences have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The Police Department has stopped blaming adults at the age of 21 and older for holding small quantities legally authorised after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado districts have announced that they will continue with the current marijuana cases, and they are still accusing people of being held.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver are voting to prevent the opening of new, licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This thing is going so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads of gossip and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - up to the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is in front of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good lead," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for granting licenses to sell alcohol to the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow," he said.
Washington Law, I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal restraints do.
And there are certain mechanical questions that must be resolved during this period, such as how to export the State's directive on "corresponding approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on hemp trade up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficult place of licensed hemp trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Hemps, a recently established research group.
On November 21st, police chief Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers, informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for holding small amounts of marijuana for every citizen of the 21st century and that police would "immediately" stop charging people with these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws governing medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana retention, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
At present, the charge of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana is facing 119 people, even though many face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute the criminal offence that was committed at the time it occurred," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was complicated in places such as the Mesa countryside, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the district, are not accusing adults of holding small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all pending cases of detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time pursuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of thecolored voters supported the measures, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contraventions across the state have revealed deep disunity among local officials in the light of this large state green experiment.
For district prosecutors, it is "a cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver representing the defendants of marijuana, and the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to view small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best path to becoming national testing cases for the legalization of drugs.
The defence and state authorities are planning new borders for legalised sales and are also anxious to receive instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
The defense attorneys of marijuana legalization hope that the justice ministry will be approved.
Despite several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, who have been attracted by attention, the majority of the federal government has left trades in medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are likely not to open the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist the possibility of a state-regulated recreational marijuana trade permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the field of drug policy of President Obama's administration.
A number of colorad cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to proceed.
Before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even though it will take about a year before any business can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we license someone and then we'll have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this supplement.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about college in Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern-style Greek symposium that motivates two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 80th century, I was two weeks after going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases, and ran into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard daily said that I gave up because I objected to loving the students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson boldly declared that I had left because I was forced to drink out of the stolen pots.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both large and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly-built advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I to the Conservative Party.
You can ask me why I'm pulling it out right now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right from the center suffer from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought equal rights protection from gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Junior Yearbooks Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political opinions they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and shown to them that they are not welcome".
They ask for a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently mentioned BBC Two documentary program called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right on the Young, Smart and Right Country about a student political event that has been portrayed by conservatives as strange and neo-Nazis.
The show was introduced by a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of Oxford University Conservative Association, who rode the Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "premier lambs" because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's paper that "left influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Twenty-eight-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such an climate is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old elected president of the AUCA Stephanie Cheryl says that there has been a deterioration in the access of JCR members to people on the right from Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one.
I started in September 1986, 18 years old and in a fragrant way shy.
Hate for the Conservative side was the hottest.
A year earlier, the university had voted against the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding higher education.
With the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also boast of fear.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students meet with each other and with teachers, I received a taste of the diaper that was supposed to come.
I have found that not only do the silent professors approve the instigation of conservative pupils, but they also take part in it with a taste.
A mining policy, privatisation and resistance of the government to apartheid sanctions in the Republic of South Africa was introduced into the wood-covered listeners.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please insert the first paragraph."
I've had enough of this.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very gallant.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I'm getting tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, that is, if you are not too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt concluded.
I got crushed back in my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight click on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the AUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's already bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labourers.
Later at the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics, who (such irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He's beating each other up, isn't he?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet similar thinking people after dark?
Would I have to turn into a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have evolved in front of me as a clearing of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative but also for being Margaret Thatcher's adviser to foreign politics and one who writes her speeches.
He wasn't almost there.
The place hated for his province and pettyness and for his leaning towards the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge in my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes were saddened.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience has deteriorated.
My friend, also a proponent of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week in the course of teaching, when another history professor in absolute seriousness declared that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was red in the studio, I admitted that "parents washed my brains" and called them "old fools".
The relief was only short-term.
My father beat a nail in my Oxford career coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I snuggled inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a stinking weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poison in the educational institute.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers came, but also hiding to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with NATO Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I. Anglicke, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host the exhibition Valentina Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the glorious retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 models of the top fashions created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signor" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until March 3rd, recaptures private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from the Princess Salim Aga Khan through the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of an international "bohemian minstrel".
To love royal families is nothing wrong.
"They don't at least stick a speck of cigarettes in a great carpet like they do some beautiful celebrity pop-music," Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemische says.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests entertain with plenty and elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains Ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance than glory.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz shows Valentina
Neither does Argentinian model Valeria Mazz forget about the charisma designer.
"It's been many years since we went to dinner at Piazza di Spagna in Rome after a show.
There were 20 of us and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he was irradiated in everything and felt his spirit.
All the invitations made him feel important and loving," recalls the top model who began working with him during the Paris Week of the Supreme Fashion in 1995.
"It never comes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he concludes.
An Apparition to Fertility
Gravanio's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been rebuilt to a particular 70 metres long passage offering an exchange of roles: the visitor turns into a model and marches to observe the "community" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces have on them as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was worn by Monica Vittiová in "Night", or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the emperor Farah Dibaová.
In the audience, the names such as Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is first love, "you can't forget him".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designermuses.
"I give him the advantage over others for his femininity and great love for women because he undermines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, they make a lot of light and they give a spark of face.
The proportions are perfect."
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampala d'Arenberg can forget how she wore Valentina for the first time.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
She finally got to the end of the '90s.
"I bought my first Valentine's dress to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a dress with a ring, a cracked belly and a top with no shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is easy to fashion, his passion is too timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The golden ridge of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul Greece in 1995.
In order to create these silky garments of ivory with all kinds of pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter towing were needed four months of work and 25 "choleks" (as the designer calls its dresser).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in specialized printing, these dresses represent the top fashion limiter of the late 20th century, "returning clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elite "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and honored by the order of the Honorable Legion collects as much respect as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, serenity, modified and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big friend.
He was wonderful, and time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: cheese carriers in the area of the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano are gambling with their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wiaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting cheese from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the island of Java.
As a result, they have to climb to the bottom of the crater every day, where they escape the sulphur gases from the interior of the earth, and when they have contact with the air, they move into a stable state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur, which weighs up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the narrow stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which spans 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted stretchers take more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle’s pace up because they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so that they do not slip down and fall into the abyss.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell from Kawah Ijen Rocks years ago.
Hornies in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of cheese they earn
When they are up there, they travel around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they are tired of carrying heavy baskets to a vase that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
This is a company called PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of cheese.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because it has its place in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening sugar.
"Because they normally carry 70 kilos, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every trip," explains Anto, who usually completes three times a day.
One road takes him three hours and he is destroyed at the end, but he can thus earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it's three times what he'd make in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, the price of coffee is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a unit.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is just as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur has already begun to collect his taxes, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than permanent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man affected by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does work as a carrier.
They share a dirty wooden hut with other stretchers and each day rises at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur at night does not cease to dislodge and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto gets into the crater and lights the way of a small lamp that he has attached to his helmet and bought it himself for his money.
About 400 stretchers carried on the shoulder of the basket with sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings has neither mechanized nor provided carriers working on their own and with such an effort, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photo charge, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) select nature park guards from tourists arriving to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle and not for people," argues Madrusin, a permanent 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades, ever since he left school.
He can raise as much as 110 kilos and assures us that he can work as long as he can, because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and catches the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners claim that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious, however, from their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulder caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues sift out 15 tons of sulphur in the volcano, which then three trucks drive down a steep road between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth with a few missing teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, also earns a share of the cheese.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts endures from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore wants a baby to save the economy
Singapore has no children, no career, no stress, and no living and education costs.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married, and I'm a patriot, and you're my wife, and you're a patriot, so let's do our civic duty, and we can start a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of an ad for menthol candy, but still - or perhaps that is why - the video in Singapore expanded massively to YouTube at the beginning of this year.
These sentences are part of the rappe that uses local hints like "put a bush in the oven" as a smile of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH Advertising Agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to highlight the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to enable people to fulfil "their civic duties".
"This is only about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to touch.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things like spreading perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, "Why don't we do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it lightly is Singapore's government.
Each year they spend $1,300 on encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last but not least, the fertility rate of 2 was exceeded, which is considered to be the restoration rate, in 1976.
Why don't Singapore have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Office, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options in life objectives and priorities, it is not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the delay in marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy was making a drastic effort to increase the influx of immigrants as measures against the decline in population numbers, this caused disfavor among the local population.
On some Singapore websites, you can see uninhibited xenophobia against many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year recorded its worst election outcome since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, an effort was made to address the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has had known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate trade.
The City Development Office has started to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These flats have a area of 46 square metres and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the youthful lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers Development Company, claims that their "boot boxes" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and they're sold for days to weeks faster than houses with a bigger area.
That is why our money flow is much better."
However, it admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have a great impact.
"People are still under stress, houses are expensive, as are education, so many people put off," says the young official.
"The rest have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and living and education costs as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they are ultimately Singaporeans who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any breach".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
He understands the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
ElPerodoico journalists reported five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely own" on a personal level and "user name and password" when it was a social network.
"My biggest secret would not be published," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing in the FB.
I talk to my friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked persons or photos of crime, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter supporters.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter to express my views and write interesting papers.
I don't know if anyone's going to answer me, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them led him to anything, nor did he want an address or a phone number.
"If they insist on me or demand it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These boys are not strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known social network friend was blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't check out of the account.
"She just activated her private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have published photos of people he knew in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if I had a problem with someone or I just wanted to.
Although I know it's cyberbullying," they claim.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate of the field of education and teaching, believes that to inform children and adolescents in social networks, they need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
He states: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of teaching at Yale University and author of the article Digital Domestics and Digital Migrants introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to disseminate, publicize and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature".
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way for children and adolescents to show what privacy is, to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porrasová also mentions some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like someone to publish your picture the way you published your friend?
You know what everyone else says about you?
When you label people in party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"A man is governed off the internet by respect, morality and other principles, and this should be the same on social networks," he argues.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-degree teacher and educator, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If he understands any indiscretion, they have a good basis for discussing with the children the consequences that the internet account may have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "don't speak to strangers".
South America Summit Ends and Proclamation from Lima Not Published
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without issuing a Declaration from Lima, which was airtightly signed by seven present presidents.
The agency Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Offices who initially decided that the document would be published after the summit, said it would be published on the Peruvian government website later.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Olli Humal in a few brief press statements.
The press had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meetings, a video was broadcast from the presidential assembly without sound with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission is blocked" in the press room.
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press to some governments that were present but not to the Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participants with presidents, which caused the disfavor of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is only the statement of President Humala, not the official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and on this occasion was not originally promised Declaration from Lima, although the press was strongly required.
On the official website of ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that broadcasts were provided for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice, which settles the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President Ollant Humal of Peru and President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which began on Monday by hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss the dispute that led Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing with this international court today," said President Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñer added, and welcomed President Humal with the grip of the two countries' flag.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be subject to the ruling of the International Court of Justice was published following Colombia's adoption of the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia found this decision to be entirely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rousef), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 after the appeal of then President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humal was charged with launching morning speeches and completing the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read the final document informing him that 16 agreements had been reached and 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR Member States would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions to improve cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and to take joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters are being promoted.
When Europe is in crisis, "it does not have economic consolidation (Latin America) to win, but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humalog added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links between different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a speech read.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit raised was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending his regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet with his Nigerian counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute over the maritime border which is challenged by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor the Treaty with Nicaragua which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that the negotiations will be conducted as civilised and as considerate as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Neita.
Within the framework of the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area's defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "from South America, in this case indeed, must teach from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on State TV Perú that Europeans "killed themselves for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there is practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which is supported by the members of the Union.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community must, however, be achieved, but there are still backward areas that want us to return to the past," he noted.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, said that he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on human rights would be taken into consideration.
"Those who are in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is financed in Washington by the United States," said the reference to political asylum provided by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised Swedish justice, which asked him to undergo interrogation in Swedish territory for alleged sexual delicacy, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows for a video conference call to be conducted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange would suffer from deterioration in physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But the danger is that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is closed in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve the incarceration of WikiLeaks.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there were talks all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, as Assange's lawyer Balthazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He said, "if the United Kingdom passes tomorrow, it'll all be over."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, how it makes it possible for the legislation there and, as has been done in other cases, the problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press and explained that it certainly does not tolerate "intermediateness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of free print are not us, the vile and depraved politicians, but the bad journalists in profit, pressure and blackmail services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither journalists nor bankers nor hegemonic countries nor bourgeoisies are in control of Ecuador, and he said that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to change the way and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain Paraguay's veto on membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerant of opportunism and pousism disguised in legality" because in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries now, at the time of the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess the scope in order to overcome them and be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope in settling the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek international instance if both countries undertake to accept a judgment, however hard it may be".
With regard to the possibility that he would run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to take up a third mandate, he noted that he perceived this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if she loses her election in February 2013, she will be out of public life.
"I have never personally cared for much, but an unfair situation such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, it's the same for me.
I've made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Madur, who says President Chávez went to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the president's state of health," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian State took part in the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning struck me," he relates in his memories of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "slow down a bit", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own thighs and start to get informed about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is no doubt one of the oldest HIV units in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it came in 1994 after several fights against disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment and greater stigma.
At the time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) did say goodbye, "because he had a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live full lives with this syndrome.
However, there are many people who do not know about their diseases and lose, until the virus caused the destruction of the organism and transmitted the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "means great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at Guadalajara Civil Hospital, with this information confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with disease, with better results for those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that one who has been diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems without problems until 75 years of age," the doctor explained.
To emphasize this progress, it is appropriate to note that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died on AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the year of the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have been killed since the discovery of AIDS by national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by this year, 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people still die from disease?
"I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't exhausted supplies of medicine, and the problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage because they don't know the state of the disease, or in the late stages of the disease."
He adds a convincing statement: "Nine of the ten patients comes when there is an associated infection. The only thing that needs to be done to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease sooner, and therefore, tests need to be offered on a large scale to detect the disease to all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to take tests in a private laboratory simply because his friend did so, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer disease that is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather cut myself three times a week," they say, but it's not my case.
Change was for the better, healthy with it, exercise, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsiblely, I am paying attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO to motivate today in World AIDS with his testimony those who are afraid.
If they risked, let them know if they're HIV positive as soon as possible, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else when they're responsible.
This message summarizes the password of the battle against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the panel
Among the health programmes and common citizens is a major gap, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who examines information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, "the handover of condoms has actually increased, once given us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Teenagers are among the most susceptible to new diseases.
"What do you want this for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, medical and healthcare professionals who want to avoid it, says the reporter.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution be changed, that condoms be not only behind the counters, but the hundred be placed in the dispensers in the public bathrooms, in places where young people often go.
"It's not the promotion of promiscuity.
They don't even want to "pay for beer and motel" as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases) have been reported.
This condition means the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in connection with HIV in Mexico.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% of the blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease on one registered case.
The judgment approved by the U.S. Court of Appeal, which fails to recognise the restructuring of Groupo Vitro’s debt by a competition in Mexico, raises a slight precedent for any national enterprise with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It therefore appears that the procedures for restructuring companies that enable Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
On 15 June last year, the approval of the judgment issued by Judge Harlin Hal at the Northern Texas Court of Appeal leaves in practice a Mexican company with no defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the second bank of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens to the main Mexican glass producer the door to the United States Supreme Court of Justice with an appeal against three irregularities.
The introduction is to say that while the judges of this case claim that creditors are to be governed by the US insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is to establish an appeal procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law, which the arbitrator designates as the American Law Institute, was created.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without a vote on branches of the internal corporate structure where the debt owed by the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the requested majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws allow this option.
The fact is that Vitro was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Competition Institute has entrusted the domestic debt.
In addition, it is true that even after the voting of the branches, creditors - against Vitro would stand in court in the United States, i.e. the funds of "soups", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencea, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.
From a different perspective, Vitro blames the court for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - on the background of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company González Sada will appeal for a new review directly to the appellate court to allow the assessment to take place in full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, since they originally voted only three.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the higher instance process, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
On the case, it is serious that the court has failed a document sent by the Mexican Government as a unit of amicus curiae, in which the procedure of Vitro is described in detail within the framework of the Competitive Law, which points out that the company has made it easier to accede to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvent Law.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, which are rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: Penalty for Vitro and the State.
Overall assessment
Without notice, the criminal notification of Mexican Aviation unions against the former owner of the company Gastón Azcarrag Andradem, who was accused of fraud, was on the table for several months, and according to the expert organisation of pilots, the vessel has already crossed over.
An instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to it, the control authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which it selected from Bank IXE F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation company 198 million pesos.
The funds were most likely directed to purchase the shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administrativoa Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Azcarrag Andrade is a major shareholder in the Posadas Hotel chain.
The siege of Dragon Martu
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the establishment of the association met at the site of Universidad de Caribe in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution center with products from the "land with a large wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a living area for employees from 150 companies in the lower part.
Previously, the Canacintra (Camara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone in order to confront the monumental area, which in part would demolish protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA
The request from the Senate, which the Government did not take into consideration and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador of the Anti-Fraud Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, signed in Japan the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propidad Industrial), has been deleted.
As we know, despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility to consider it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In order to pay off long-term debts and not to influence the short term, Homex puts investment certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest payments every 28 days.
Born Competival
The association of leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has created a company called Competival, aimed at the software service market in Central and South America.
Investment in business exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this gym sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he got brain strokes on a wheel chair in 2008 lit up in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a national basketball league player, the owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I have held many roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the General Manager of the National Team and the President of the Federation," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of the Primer Hora newspaper at his home in Bayamón, where he had been living for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't go too far in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and reminders of his long career, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement from all the guards, those who recall his actions in the fate of Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity with the team to participate in eight championships since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one champion in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted at BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here at Alabama University at the time, said to me, "I have a two-meter-old player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gaussé's player, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy brought Bayamona a victory in the championship, Gaussa would contribute to the next one."
The championship, when Vaqueros played Gauss for the team, was enjoyed, but only remotely because in 1988 he had already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's placement on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we should have bronze not to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panameri Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we sprayed a United States team that was pretty much like the one that blew the bronze at the World Cup.
The men had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and Piculína (Ortiz), but also had young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leonova (Francesco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 for knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a man of the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players at the Soup, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior Player Rolando Hourruitner, who replaced the players who were excluded from the competition in the Panameritic Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best Puerto Rican player?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his actions in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much from young people.
Which success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous period of the National Men's Age between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BSN had a national league in one season up to 17 men.
What haven't you been able to prove?
There were things that I wanted to introduce, like the distribution of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other island corners only in national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant judges and referees.
Nice to meet you.
What are you dedicated to now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my day, I enjoy grandkids, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife Isabel's company, which has always been on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, world famous for John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, where he embodyed a man who acted indifferently and was indecency and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the ferocious oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series, became a symbol of famine in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new series of Dallas, died in accordance with the official family announcement provided by the Associated Press production company Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment she died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life completely," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and Hagman undergoes transplantation.
Years before the TV broadcast of Dallas, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent guy in the lightened comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC Station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jina) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were sent only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His action in the movies included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colours.
But it was also Hangman’s master performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R., who led him to the startop.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about a work of emotion when Hangman's figure was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of viewer speculations around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped to achieve a record in the ministry.
The November 1980 edition, in which the answer was revealed, was followed on average by 41 million TV viewers. Dallas became the second most popular entertainment show since the end of the show MASH in 1983, followed by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin fired at J.R. (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to label her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town. There were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy with charismatic smile: an attractive entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who tried to keep his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be: "Here lies the honorable citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Friday Hagman as someone who was "great on the canvas and beyond".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know it and love it.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"The five parts of the second row have already been completed and the sixth was just rolling," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or from the TNT station about how the show would continue.
The father of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who radiated in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth in 1931 to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried luck on theatre scenes in New York, and then in 1952 to 1956 he served in England for aviation.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, Malibu, California, where there were many celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or hurt someone," Prens Associada said.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital where he helped combat patients.
"I like them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
A course begins to explore "the end of the world"
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course at the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible attraction: the end of the "long number" of Mayan calendar that was due to come on December 21st, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budgetary gap that some call "long Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel is being drawn, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most japocalyptic semester I've ever been," Charmé told the students of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When a person analyzes what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good to apocalyptic thinkers.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Barry Vacker's professional assistant is organizing the course "Accordings, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these thoughts spread over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from the examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professors of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, joined together to organize a course with the simple name End of the World.
"We don't join '2012' because we always count on the possibility to set the course again if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatful destruction" students must study, create projects and perform final tests.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place in the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He split up within two hours," Restall said of his course for students with high averages who registered 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received questions by e-mail as to whether there was still room.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," she said at the Rutgers University in Camden, 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Thus, apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he saw all the apocalypse films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no professed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was to discuss the Mayan forecast and to reject it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predictions of the end of the world.
The bloom of these speculations has caused the Internet.
"Jinde people don't think about it," he said.
It happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew of a course on "the end of the world", answered quickly.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the highest office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that during the years many days of the last court were discussed, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people would start immediately to think about the next date" or to philosophy that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at which the world would disappear.
The date takes on the light weight of students and professors.
A number of them said they were going to go to the end of the world.
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communications student, explained.
