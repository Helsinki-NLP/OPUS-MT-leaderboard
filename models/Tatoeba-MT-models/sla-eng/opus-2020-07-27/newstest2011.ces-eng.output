What does he do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the sugar shop
The new councillors of the capital of ČSSD will likely have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand in the Prague Council and the representation of their Staron colleagues from ODS.
Dnínik Aktuná.cz members of the new council from ČSSD "tried" as they know the notorically introduced slang, which was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The Coded Dictionary, which introduced the Prague political wasteland during the premier era of Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new council of acquaintances did not understand much.
At least he's saying it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a rookie in Prague politics," he responded to the test of the "Kmotrovský" language counsel for culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And while it was a political veteran, so did Councilman Karel Březina.
Like the term "golf pit."
"It's the only expression you're offering me, which I sometimes use."
"Unlike slang in general, I don't recognize."
From a dictionary whose phrases the daily Aktualno.cz published this June before the election congress ODS, she selected six examples, mostly those which are notorically associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Socialists had to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf pit in Prague", "go to the sugar shop", "the bull's necks", "the betrayal of the capital" and "the stain".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague school in the future - first the interview vowed, but later he did not take the phone.
Councillor Peter Dolinek just rejected the test.
"I don't solve these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the way civil democrats do."
"I now decide how we will understand our programmes," he reacted.
As has already been said, Councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the title above that it is an influential businessman and a friend of the exhibitor Bém Roman Janoušk.
"Voldemort" Kaucksky tells him nothing, and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf pit in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says, "but I know it from the paper."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
The golf hole is then decoded not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the environmental council Lukáš Plachy.
The two Social Democrats then know who Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachym is also known where to find this figure - understands the meaning of the term "go to the sugar shop".
"I mean, it means going to some Prague business," is a shy close-up that is the seat of Janoušk's companies.
In line with Březina, he reminds us that knowledge is pumped from the newspapers rather than to use such a dictionary.
There is no similar word for slang expression in social democracy according to test frequencies.
"I've been working with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have that kind of thing."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes using abbreviations and lines of names," says Czech President Petr Hulínský of Prague, whose strangers are calling Huld.
"At school they called me Brzez, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Březina," he admits to his nickname Karel Březina.
The daily currently.cz name has tried and worked.
Councilman Weinert is Grandfather's party or less friendly Grandfather, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned of fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has a nickname for some colleagues called "The Games".
The nicknames are also the only thing social democrats in the intra-party speech accept.
Hulínsky says Huldu does not like to hear, but the daily Aktualno.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague President.
He said that Peter Hulínský won his title JUDR. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
They're more of an older generation, they can't get involved in work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have kids.
The one who happens to be a witch is sent to isolation not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Might this fate be very rare."
"Nor do young healthy women move away because they help work and give birth to children," says a regular sister who in the capital city of the West African State of Burkina Faso is old in a special house for more than a hundred women who have been evicted from their communities.
The local government has now decided to step up against an unusual "social measure".
She published an information brochure that should help the witch hunt limit.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard pointed to the disadvantage of written education.
The accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, with Burkina Faso next door, twenty-seven-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, spilled oil and burned her.
The BBC server informed the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was burned with oil used for ritual anointing.
He said he set sail after the group wanted to cast out the evil spirit from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
The daily Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devourers of human souls have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt is being sought by the government, the president himself took part in the Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammie, after his aunt's death, unleashed an extensive hunt for witches who were supposed to participate in her death and try to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"The shamans from the nearby Guinea who, accompanied by the police, soldiers and personal protections of the President, violently took the randomly chosen men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in her report.
At the farm, people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Melting in stones, higher rent signed
The older planted man walked out of the door of the client center of RPG Apartment "Uglobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a component and in it a new lease on three apartments: his own, his daughters, and his son, who is in execution.
All three of them have just made the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for the second category of 4100 crowns from next year.
"And it is not warm water there and it must be melted petrama (stone for heavy fuel, note red)," the man points out with his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half cancelled.
Civil Society BytyOKD.cz, which branded the new lease terms "uncorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7 when they publish instructions on how to deal with them.
But a man only shakes hands with it.
"One says it, the other one," he goes.
Ostrava becomes a large laboratory deregulation.
After the New Year, there is a large majority of the apartments that are not yet leased in the Czech Republic.
Currently.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava, and on Tuesday at 9 a.m. it is full.
Right next door is security from the security agency and a trigger.
"Our 2011" lights a special button on his touch screen.
One knock and a piece of paper comes out of the machine with a number.
You won't be able to read "157" and your number is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a moment’s rent, he comes to ask an elderly couple, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to concern any new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems like others - requests for repairs, insurance, etc.
Letters with new leases have been received in Ostrava to mail boxes by tenants in the majority of the total of 44,000 RPG portfolios since mid-November.
RPGs offer them an increase of 15 to 38 percent in letters.
On November 18th, a special reservation to new rentals was opened at the client centre.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's only on the run," the workers behind the counter respond after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local exciting topic.
Before the elections, he was picked up loudly by Parliamentary Vice-President and Islander Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't changed my toilet board yet," the man mentioned in the introduction said.
Most of the time, according to the employees, pensioners come to see if they can get a discount if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount for the February rent will also be granted to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
Havířov's "deregulatory" partition but the questions are definitely not covered.
"From the last 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 people here for the 2011 rental," employees estimate.
The RPG, on the web and its walls, proposes individually negotiating contracts where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, an independent court will have to determine it.
"It is not about threats, but about information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedure," RPG points out on its pages.
"There will be no trial here," she thinks one of the RPG Flats employees, and the man on the street in front of the client center gives her the truth in part.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I do not have to judge," he says.
But the workers will only become discouraged.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them not to sign in the media, so people probably wait," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartment, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental is still not even up to the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of RPG Housing's residence portfolio, that the upset tenant's lack of housing fund is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to homeowners.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest four billion in flats, four years from 2011 to 2014, it would be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling across from the semi-sitting seats of the Havířov waiting room is repeating several red-expressed information.
"A 15 % increase in rent in 2011 and less is 31,200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats in the RPG portfolio will receive a rent of 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19,66 per square metre," RPG notes.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not drive out rents to jump, but will be spread out within four to eight years.
In addition, he adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to apartments, mainly to thermal savings - new windows and warming.
Preferably, they are to be obtained by people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices include the kindergarten, the architects understand
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, creative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, she can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
The project-architectonic company Arch.Design, whose studios produced a number of important Brno buildings, has been counting the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the building Avriopoint.
She employs almost 90 people at the age of babyboom, and she cares that women designers and architects can quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of short-term engagement, kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social programme.
The constructionists and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with caring for the child.
The Ministry invented the employees of Arch.Design themselves, and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (supply of CZK 2.8 million) they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
Following the exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school for its own costs for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and, with the request for a grant, Economy Rating significantly assisted.
The care is provided by qualified staff, children are provided by the nurse and the MŠ teacher throughout the day, so children can go to school without age limit, although most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "miniscule school", there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but more is being replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the mini-school programme is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic learning to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and the stress situation with the delayed removal of children from schools away from the parents’ workplace.
Parents thus use working hours more productively.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design has thus become part of Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house of bones is fascinated after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí.
The roof looks like the back of a real lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and balconies are open fish mouth.
This is Casa Batlló's house in Barcelona from Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to its organic shapes, he obtained a nickname from the Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade resembling sheds and everywhere soft curves, that's all typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The head of the house plays dream lines, gentle colors, and textures that resemble nature and animals.
During the detailed observation, you can see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, illuminated so that the impression of the light of color is even stronger.
Violating and twisting shapes with the same measure also appears in the interior.
The wood in the waves is copied by windows frames, rails, ornamental elements of doors, puppets and leaves.
The House of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, was rebuilt from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally insisted on tearing down the old building and building a whole new one, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But Antoni Gaudí didn't design the business house himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
It was on its design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
Many other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the house Casa Batlló started a successful collaboration with Jujola with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudí Casa Milá and the park of Güell, where there are other works of Gaudí.
From the locals, after completion, he obtained the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to his organic forms.
Others called it the "living house" because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, Patron of Catalan, is depicted at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motives include other sculptor elements of the building.
Gaudí proposed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
The bizarre may seem their forty-five degree slope.
During the construction of Gaudí, he did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the construction, although it obtained a building permit from the city, it indicated that the planned reconstruction was so important that two years later, when the city council was completed, the result was hoarded and requested repair.
For example, the counseling officer failed to intervene in the public corridor as well as in the construction work.
On the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call, Josep Batlló requested a (and successfully obtained) permit to rent two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry store.
The entire six - story house crosses the staircase, which can be climbed to the very roof terrace.
The key elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting space.
The social section can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably together without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudí’s reconstruction, apart from the new facade, also received an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
The impressive game of Gaudí with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which cover the inner courtyard, and lights.
The game of two colors delivers maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was easy to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun’s rays.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and dignified apartment available to the public.
The owners decided not until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The tours were maintained because they found that it was a very advantageous business and extended the tours to common and sub-frontier areas, including the roof terrace.
The entrance to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a twenty percent discount.
Suma greatly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to be quick to associate with one of the residents of the houseman and visit him directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: Women have different requirements than men
Never a dignified bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, that is, mattresses and grills, gives the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be added harmonically in order to meet the specific user.
Many things are decided by choice, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The interior type of mattresses and grills are also important.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages where they do not regularly melt, latex mattresses are not suitable because they slow down "heat".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
However, it is necessary to rotate them regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still on a hard board, they're holding off the moisture: there could be mold under them.
It is also the custom to choose.
Whoever has spent longer time abroad, where they often use a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they won't sleep here."
"On their distended shoulders, heel and hips they needed mattresses that softened the layers of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misinterpret "information" from joints and skins," explains Sylva Hadamczyková, who specializes in painted furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were therefore looking for lazy foam mattresses years ago.
"Today it's fine, the proper mattress needs Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape according to absorbed heat or adjusts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't turn around at night like after a hard fight.
You just get better sleep.
The foam also works as a protection against larynx.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height add the length of the foot, which is between 21 and 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm so they need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, e.g. for singlelists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"In other words, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands slightly folded in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Cechmistrine of the members and decorators, who have devoted a number of years to healthy sleep and ergonomicity of the furniture and teach it at vocational schools.
For a double bed you need each of your own grills and mattresses, but here you will be careful when shopping to sweeten the heights of mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing other than fitting the grills into different heights, but you do not have to succeed with each frame of the bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres count on the moulding and mating layer.
"By touching your hand or sitting on a mattress you certainly can't feel the spring," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The entire bed, when mattresses and mats are like growed Siamese twins, do not have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are badly ventilated, and they can't wash away their sweat, which is common today.
And since we usually do 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat overnight, it's clear that after five to seven years of mattressing starts to resemble one big (and tight) net.
Therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even life guarantees.
But everything has its own butt.
Therefore, do not give up on the practice of sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up a noticeable coating, but add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although the mattress coatings are now commonly produced all over the circuit, we will get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however, manipulation of the larger types (and at one person) might be a reminder of the light weights in the heavy ring during the filming.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of grilling?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night visits.
However, wear the board (if it no longer has) vents and use a springboard mattress and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in sachets (including Taschenfederkern) and a cypress layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
On non-positioning lamela grills with 14 to 18 lamellas will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (need a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid the grills with more lamels, 28 and more where the lameles in the area of the thigh are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning lammel grills do not include spring-basket mattresses because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to the stiffness settings of the lamel you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
It's a special lamole capture that allows you to push, or even tilt the lammel so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "remove".
For men who have "arms all over their backs", certainly an important thing.
Even the producers of mattresses, who started using the softening zone in the "men" area, already remember it.
Women are also remembered - the soft surface in the hip sites again.
For the most demanding customers are the wings or slabs with so-called multitors piercing.
The pressure is divided into multiple points and the voltage is reduced.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grill the wrong pillow (big and "bloated"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is supposed to support the head and to interfere with the shoulders only with the tips so that shoulder muscles can be released.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the cushion should be aligned (with the shoulder blade or the soft zone in the mattress) with the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original straws filled with grasses.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least premixtures.
Trend is simply bio at mattresses.
Oil raw materials, which produce polyurethane foams, are replaced by natural oils, such as Scotch and soybean.
The soybeans are being used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíčeček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also allow microcapsules to relax the fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" the plant extract from the birch to absorb heat and cool the body, women on the other hand "he melts".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it's weaker in sex.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (he has larger pores with broken cell structure, is thus more breathy than normal polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
The combination of various cold foam and flax foam thicknesses creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thighs and heel are supposed to be.
You'll pay for quality mattresses from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate, they are taken as medical aids.
For the first time in the Czech Republic, he reached this advantage of Gumotex.
Saving on mattresses and grills is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers a mattress Duofreeze with all memory foam Memory to reach for 11 990 crowns.
However, the other one is free.
Eru lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density started with "cosmic" tempur material.
It was originally created as material for NASA because at startup astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur in heat softens, but in cold, it is strengthened.
The warm human body thus perfectly adapts and breaks down its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of lesions, but also to increase the comfort of sleep.
Viskoelast foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which make it easy for the legs and venous system.
For example, native producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and so on.
Watchers want more and more parents, so they want to look after their children.
Fear of your own child leads more and more people to thinking of watching over GPS.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also monitor people’s movements and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine - year - old Anika Janatkova.
The device is as big as a box of cheese so far, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people scared the case of Anička and started drinking about the means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood of some tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance facilities on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some cases, such devices may be abused, perhaps if they are put in a bag for someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most really customers buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the box and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if the child doesn't want to wear anything like this, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be controlled."
"Great expectations were earlier triggered by mobile parents, which, however, can be switched off as well as these tracking devices," says Bočková.
According to her, it is also disputed whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his or her whereabouts."
"Now it's a phone."
"When surveillance devices begin expanding, they will also look for them because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices may help in the event of accidental pedophiles attack.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and persons, even when there is an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device can be set up to regularly send the position after a certain period of time."
"If there is any damage to it, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available."
"The expensive devices also have built-in tiltometers, so even if a person slips and stays still, he will send an immediate warning device with positioning," Czech says.
According to him, smart mobile phones with navigation can also be used to record special software.
The problem of current tracking units is that it is either a device similar to the size of a box made of cheese or smaller mobile phones.
They're always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why he is now testing a device that looks like a normal digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a possible aggressor does not need to know the tracking device at all."
"Or he knows them for a while and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether they develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to guard cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (using normal auto navigation) and mobile phone functions reporting the current vehicle position.
The army has the incendiary cords to wrap the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometers of ropes that fired the cracks.
As of last year, the Ministry of Defence has added 224 kilometres of cords to the warehouses.
So the Army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the permanence of the cord is two, up to four years.
The army bought inflammatory cords from the STV Group stock, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in support of the purchase of such a huge quantity of MF DNES burn lines, wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometres of lighters per year in training.
However, the calculations of military pyrotechnics, which the MF DNES has addressed, suggest that all generals, military officers, secretaries or cleaning staff would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
The Secretary of Defense, Alexandra Vondru, and the commander of the Vlastimila Picka army, are not exempt.
It's the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of 60 kilometers of matches.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's supplies would be enough for over ten years.
If, on the contrary, the basic training of each new professional is enough to provide at least two metres of inflammatory cords, as experts say, and the army with fresh purchases has secured - even with increased consumption of women's or special units - supplies for the mentioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade have recently complained personally to Minister Vondrov that they have almost no bullets in their handguns, so the shootings are limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me that they buy so many matches from us over and over."
"But it's their decision, and they know for sure what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we are trying to meet as merchants," says STV Group manager Jan Děcky.
Defence Department Speaker Jan Pejšek explains hundreds of kilometres of bought ropes and that the army will have supplies of this "munice" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group is talking only about the four-year viability of the lighter and police or military pyrotechnics, even for two years.
"In perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to make his name public because of the military's criticism.
After the passing of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers on life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument from the ministry is a 445km reduction in the volume of inflammatory lines.
"We were 60 per cent less than last year's supply of two hundred and forty kilometres," spokeswoman Pejšek interpreted the view of the Ministry of Defence's buyers.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police are always ordering just enough to use this ammunition before the lifespan.
It has proven to her because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already in considerable difficulty with the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty era, when two hundred thousand Czechoslovak armies were preparing to draw on the Rhine.
The Czech, according to the pyrotechnics that the MF DNES has addressed, is waiting for the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometres of old matches it is buying today.
Today I draw from the contacts I won thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytlun helped him to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year's winner of the competition Petty Officer of the Year became an eight-year-old businessman, Lukáš Pytloun, of Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and bank credit he bought a half-exploded house with five flats.
To being a student of the third year of high school back then, that was a lot of courage.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us did not allow me to do anything about it," says Luke Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment began renting foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back in the house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, over seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another one came to him as well as a quality one.
"We have a signed contract with the hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other applicants for the franchise of the hotels Pytloun is reporting," says shopkeeper number one.
"And in this sale of the hotel license was very much involved in the victory in the competition Zivnostnik of the Year," Pitloun adds.
His victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often added congratulations to me and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
The contest definitely recommends to all who try something.
You don't even have to win, every sighting is good.
He says he's drawn from contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten anywhere else.
"Some whom I met because of the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has been a little of the same for every employee.
And he's got about 70 of them.
"I look at their greater loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of a good job for all of us."
"My name is only on the front line," says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at the Farmet.
Euphoria from victory quickly reversed the impact of the crisis.
However, because of the goal of knowing the winner, the Farm has worse times behind it.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Ždárský, arrived at the Slovenian House last year for the price in last year's Vodafone Company competition.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he had made in building a small workshop in the Czech Skalic company with hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that appreciation has encouraged not only me, but all my associates and increased our confidence in the competition fight," the winner of last year says.
At the beginning of the company's history, Farmet was eager to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karl Ždárski's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists seized property, he didn't hesitate for a long time, he refused a career at the company where he worked, and with a couple of friends around his dad, they set up a company for plastic baths.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in the foxes of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the unscrupulous public has been gained by the company after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," Karel Ždárský said.
But last year, in Farmet, it was not just a sign of euphoria from victory.
The award was based on the company’s economic results by 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis, which had not affected citizens as much as it did, had already come to an end, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and had begun to limit purchases of new machines and technologies.
Of course, this situation didn't elude us either.
"The claims fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was also release," Karel Ždárský explained.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, even though less than before the crisis.
However, what they failed to do in Farmet is to invest in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from grants, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main awards in the home exhibitions," Zďárský said.
Everything shows that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Ždárský.
A survey that removes senseless rules
The survey on Absurdit of the Year is the fourth part of the business clan.
Some senseless regulations have already been repealed.
The non-famous winner of the second year of the Absurdita survey of the year has become the duty to bear on the Office documents which are also accessible to officials online.
She decided more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, social security management required a paper extract from the trade register, even though the official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the poll, it's going to change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register for checks on insurance payers," said ČSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
Enlighten all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and it is pointless to cancel them with the purpose of the Absurdita competition of the year.
This year, the fourth part of the business festival organized by the Economic News is already in its fourth year, and there is an increasing popularity among the public.
If about 3,000 voters took part in the vote last year, it was almost 4,000 this year.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that only serve to retain business are still enough and enough.
"For example, in the number of tax returns we are in front of the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the business conditions, the Czech Republic placed itself at the 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
The absurdity competition was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be applied each year from April to the end of September when the competition is concluded.
The website address www.firmaroku.cz then selects seven candidates for the competition to vote on the "anticenu" during October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that wins the most votes.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations that do not make sense have been entered in this year's survey.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition there was, for example, a requirement among the nominees that motorway maintenance cars and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
This year's list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place always at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this award.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state kicks the entrepreneurs under their feet, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs that are just unnecessarily complicated today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break a pointless regulation doesn't make it empty.
In 2007, the company’s obligation to report three days in advance to the trade office at the place where a permanent establishment is located, the intention to take a stand for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment of the trade law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007 that the employment of its foreign employee has been removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And to the third of all good things.
The 2009 absurdity led to a regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two embroidery scales in the office.
This year's decree by the Ministry of Health has been eased - the duty to have a refrigerator has fallen off.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Values with ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year's fifth annual competition is called the 2010 Responsible Company.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartoldy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel competition of the year.
In this year's first year of this special subcategory, Vodafone's main competition 2010 was registered by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring, and he would publish a separate article.
Although the subject of one's activities differs from another, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities, such as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 national finalists, for example, Et Netera, a Prague software company that supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the funding fund for handicapped children for 17 years.
The old paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of its staff disabled, became the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and was placed in the Vodafone Company of the year as the third in the region.
At Olomouck, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which established flexible working hours, won an even lower average of 35 hours per week, but without a moderately reduced salary.
The title was also given by the jury for buying primarily from Czech producers, promoting civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to ensure that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Commentator Milusz Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecké region again thinks about the health of its employees and has given them ergonomic chairs and keyboards to each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local factory.
"In addition, we support the people in distress Foundation, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Praň and cleaning from the Karlovy region, which contributes to their retirement allowances to its employees in the form of over-standard bonuses.
"In us again we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal construction company Timech, winner of Moravian Silesia Region.
In the category Responsible company of the year all the regional finalists of Vodafone Company of the year were automatically logged in, who answered questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it no later than 15 August to the organisers.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded by the organiser from the evaluation.
"Unless the representatives of the competing company answered the questions, the competitions were not able to be held by the Responsible Company of the Year, but they were not disqualified from the "prime" Vodafone Company of the Year."
"It is not possible to log into this competition alone, because it is a subcategory of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizer agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen the police arrested in public competition
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen in the past days, anti-corruption police were arrested.
The detectives' irons were placed by local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and a businessman with real estates Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate just the ongoing public competition to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would receive a specific bidder.
That's what Luboshi G was supposed to pay for.. half a million crowns.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for crossing the fence in public procurement and in public competition," said the Law of the Chief of State Antonia Zelena, who said that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Six-and-a-half-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The way in which a public competition could be influenced can only be speculated, given the minimum of official information.
Speakers of the Land Fund Lubomíra Černá said on a question of Law that at a separate workplace in Pilsen the police actually arrested during the public competition.
"It was about the client, not our employee," she explained.
According to the Black Competition, the correct title is "Request to apply for transfer of land under the Land Act" and it takes place when more eligible applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons, within the challenge, offer a higher value for their restitution rights to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the purchasers' order shall be established, and the Land Fund shall then transfer the land to the person who has offered the highest entitlements," the fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who applied for the challenge, and because he himself was also a legitimate person because he had acquired a number of restitution rights, he offered the applicant to land that he would not take part in the competition.
He must have cashed in the withdrawals for that.
That would explain he had so much money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had over-standard contacts on PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former head of PF Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing in the replacement restitution of the land on which the decision on the location of the building was already made.
That is when Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, in particular in the place where the arrival highway was to be built in the Borská pole industrial zone.
Later, he traded them very favourably with a magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which was worth much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to enter because otherwise it would have threatened to block the land.
Households for housing pay hundreds a month
Households will have to be charged not only for all kinds of energy from January, but also for water and crinkling, heat supplies and some increase in rent.
Families will have to get hundreds of crowns out of their wallets every month from January.
The electricity will betray up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to charge for water supplies and many will also undermine central heat supplies.
The exposure to electricity in households should go year after year by stokoruna, rather than now.
The prices of strong electricity have all been reduced by the main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, in particular of photovoltaics.
Although the gas is slightly betrayed, it is at a time when people are the most melting and thus the highest consumption.
Therefore, each year it must also count on hundreds of additional crowns.
While electricity and gas betray all over the Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from the place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns per month extra, more than 1000 crowns per year to pay families in Liberec.
In Prague, more than 9 percent of the population will be betrayed by watery and silhouettes, if the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, they'll charge the Pruned 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will continue to be in the overall republican comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, it is expected that 7.4 percent of the water and crevices will be watery and silhouetted.
For example, the price of rent in 450 thousand rental apartments can increase markedly, where regulation has ended since January.
For example, CPI Flats, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rent by up to a hundred percent from January.
Those who don't agree with the new rent are going to put the company to trial.
The regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 flats could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, especially a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drink most often ends in the care of doctors drunkards who have not been 15 years old.
The exception is not children who are treated with monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This is due to the experience of doctors who face similar cases at the reception of hospital children’s wards.
"Some beers or wines are completely out of order, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"Trende is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children's Department of the Hospital of Horzovice in Central Bohemia, told the Law.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of Dad's closet, it's whiskey, or else it's fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not feeling so much then," the chief explained.
And for the truth, he's also been given by the spokesman Motol Eva Jurin Faculty Hospital.
"Most often it's a fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases it was the plum that they brought from home," said Jurin.
According to Pelican, 13 - year - olds or 14 - year - olds on hospital income are quite common.
In front of Gořovici, where he has been since this year, he has worked for 10 years on pediatrics in Motola, where ambulances bring down the schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per cent of alcohol in her blood, in addition to ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Holesovice for some dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother did not find it odd that she did not know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief surprised.
Parents ’ lack of interest or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring are viewed as the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
However, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the right sense, according to experts in children.
"Under the term alcoholic, there is a multi-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that are relevant to it, and that is not the case for children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a symbolic unruly family-social background," explained Prime Minister Pelican.
According to spokesman Jurin this year, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at Motole paediatric clinics by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be able to access the statistics.
Children's drunkards who take their parents home after hospital treatment don't count on them, either.
In addition to the fact that children sit down after school and drink a bottle of casseroles, there are three seasons according to Pelican that can be relied on: witches, Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"It's either they sing the grief of bad faith, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I've had seven baby drunks at the reception of the witch," said Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in favor of the one who suffers from an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
The early headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger an intoxicating infusion with glucose and nutrients missing by the body.
"They're actually better at it because after that beautiful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing is more painful."
"Only they are confused about where they are," Pelican admitted that sometimes they spoil patients with a pleasant mood at least by calculating the costs their treatment required.
The transfer of ambulances and hospitalization to an acute bed will result in tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, when I worked directly for those children on a vision, calculating how much their drunkenness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer at the brigade to make money for that one party," Pelican added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not pay the costs of treatment in the case of children's drunkards.
Two L-159 planes are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft from a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Sevilla, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS aircraft resides.
It's the first time machines of this type have appeared in possession of someone other than the Czech army.
In a foreign country, they've only been on training or show years.
It is a two-seat version of L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which have been piloted.
The remaining three machines are unique L-159.
You are still standing in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the business - Omnipol - took over from last week.
When the aircraft physically departs from Vodochod, according to Jan Pejšek of the Defence Press Department, it is not yet known.
"Singular L-159 aircraft for the exchange have been disbursed from long-term aircraft, without any other deposits and investments from the Ministry's department."
"The dual L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said Law of Pejšek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-bedroom aircraft, because the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four non-essential L-159 machines into two two-bedroom machines.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the other one takes over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS committed to deploying aircraft into the armament of some of the alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that L-159 is the customer of L-159 aircraft by the EADS and will be used to train NATO pilots."
"There is therefore a matter for the recipient of how this thing will be carried out," said Pejšek.
The newspaper of the economy said a while ago that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159, was not interested.
Last year, the government of Mirko Topolánka approved the exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Defence did not write down the purchase of the tender and addressed directly to the EADS.
The defence’s leadership at that time argued that future exports of L-159 would be supported by a replacement.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and only used 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes is likely to have a court order.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it was intended to select aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tendre and not by highlighting one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one to arrive at the Kbely airport in Prague in 14 days.
Longer index than ring means a lower risk of cancer
Men with a index finger longer than a ring are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to the study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
Could be related to the level of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men up to 60 years," said Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring.
They were given the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, for those with a index finger longer than a ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men in their 60 ’ s it fell even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed in prenatal period - appears to reflect different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer pointer.
Previously, research has shown that testosterone is the one that supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Paches for the Czech Republic said that he knows about this study quite rightly, but he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks lies mostly eaten snow, roadmen riding in many places all night.
The D5 is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Razvadov due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and also stands D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
Newsroom was told by Central Automobile (UAMK) dispatcher.
A truck crashed on the 91th km, two trucks crashed on the 93th km, and the accident claimed injury.
Several personal cars also ended up in the trench.
Problems are also on D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed in there.
Drivers should go directly to Brno on the 190th km or over Brno and then travel on the 182nd km to Kývalka.
There are a few kilometers of columns there.
Also on D11 highway is an accident, right next to the arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a multicentimeter layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, the wheels of cars are formed on the Average, and Štěrboholská is packed.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams ride with delay, for example, on the route between Karl Square and Mir Square.
The Prague Crisis Squad is scheduled to be back at eight in the morning.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech roads had already had to cancel seven fast connections for snow.
For example, the problem has a track from Prague to Kralub or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyně was closed from midpoint 11 hours a night to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already coming down, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškovsk there are three roads by road, in Brno there are snowy languages and in Blanensk there is a need to overcome some of the communications in the snow chain places above.
The most affected were Vyškovska.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They're going to have to be latched.
When they pass, they can't be estimated yet.
Caution is needed in the area of White Carpathians in Hodonínsk.
On roads that are maintained only by inert sprinkles because of nature protection, the level of snow is up to five centimeters, according to the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, about two to ten centimetres of snow, most of it fell in northern Bohemia, many to 18 centimeters.
In Moravskoslez region, about 15 centimeters of snow occurred.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually rising.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army deployed a new smart weapon in Afghanistan, now known only as XM-25 code mark.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the Taliban's conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is kind of like a little super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles indicate a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special charges are 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive crack, actually function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic pathways.
So they can be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, behind a wall, or in a ditch.
The upper part is not usually protected, and when the deadly rain of steel shards is lifted, it can be removed from battle.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first gun for infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier deals with it in principle by finding the target, sending to it a laser beam that determines the distance so that it gets a precise point of purpose, according to it adjusts the intention and squeezes the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon will be loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audiette said.
Moved 400 jobs
Fujitsu's concert moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July of next year from the previous administrative building to the Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant reported on Wednesday in a field specializing in computers and their maintenance, he will move 400 men and women to Astro Park in July of next year from the former administrative building at Marienbader-town in Bad Homburg, which is a large administrative complex on Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to spokesman Fujiru, another 100 jobs should be moved there in due course, which are currently divided in the region.
The rental offer was said to be a very attractive and large-scale office in Astro Park that is more suitable for employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was only hired.
Competent Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global society such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region caused yesterday the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers.
The head of the economic referee in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this managed to win a "global player".
They say it's "a fantastic expression of confidence in this location".
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed on time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not alter the difficulties of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property at Marienbader-namst.
The result was decisive economic reasons.
It is now a matter of preventing prolonged non-sustainment in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The House in Rathaus-town, which had used Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" belonged ten years ago with the other buildings at Marienbader-town to the most discussed construction plans of the spa town.
The railway station and the town hall were created as a joint city project and a private designer of the so-called city entree, who was criticised for the massive construction of the areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001 the company of investment advice and rating Fari, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the house as well as Fujitsu's computer manufacturer, who was then connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancan-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after the year were sold Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers for example computers and servers available and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohanu area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's most employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Nederrad subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building of Astro Park, 7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the starry landscape, which is 20 years old, is situated among others also the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon disables the server - threats against Assang
WikiLeaks gets in close.
Amazon's Internet service shut down a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reportedly being held in the UK.
Wikileaks, a discovery platform, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, he called on the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman of other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's search list, is to be held under one newspaper post in the United Kingdom.
"Vikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in a free country", activists announced the publication of short Twitter messages on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon’s web company downloaded Wikileaks’ documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic dispatches to handle a high number of access documents.
With the help of Twitter, WikiLeaks explained this step: "Fine - our dollars will now be spent by hiring people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers made a search, she published CNN TV stations on the basis of Lieberman's information.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called on other countries to prevent the platform from using servers.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, irresistibly and indifferently, putting our national security at risk and endangering life all over the planet," the unbiased senator said in a statement.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
On the basis of a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in Britain, Scotland Yard, says he knows the exact place.
An Internet activist has always referred to an investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
WikiLeaks Speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's rightfully worried about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson seems to have responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the person responsible for publishing the Wikileaks for treason be charged and executed.
In Canada, one of the government's advisors, Stephen Harper, apparently ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, there was a firefight between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "smirky and absurd" that Assange has asked Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to resign if she is responsible for the recently published espionage challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now exploring the security of its databases.
A Special Commissioner was appointed the deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "needed reforms in the structure" that are necessary after the release of messages from the mission to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger for publishing on WikiLeaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the foreign ministry's spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them, if necessary."
Freezing University
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream sugars are prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for future ice-creamers, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors are coming from around the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from, anyway?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatier, a Czech slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes out the ice cream wipe out of the icebox, wipes it into a platter and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, it will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice-cream university ice-cream manufacturer to match the ice cream from his machines to the Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors come from around the world.
But there are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream shop.
Some yearn for a new career in Midlife-Crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worlds - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke of Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own work after years of stressing work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an icebox in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in the household, Julia, came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will explain first to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only a good taste, but also a silky tenderness and good consistency.
Luciano won't forget during her training for a Southern and patriotic cherry cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it includes a notary dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which warms everything by electronic program at 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a roost and leaks pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of time to the unknown.
Whoever is talking about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently also used stabilisers - mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will have ice pellets alone.
Certain variations of basic matter are vacation.
It'll be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes ice cream from ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavoured ingredients on you."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from a white base material that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all kinds of chocolate temptation.
Now she's allowed to take a course in ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and licorice ice cream - either with or without eggs in basic material, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment also takes place with fruity types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit mash - due to taste, it is not always better.
Nutmeg ice cream may not taste more nutmeg when it contains more nutmeg.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will be produced by a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only after a balanced mixture will the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach feathers are used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
The lemon ice cream requires extra portions of sugar.
Luciano removes the apparatus to determine the sugar content of fruit (winners measure grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Ice cream production no longer requires as much physical effort as it did before.
It does not only help with automatic production of basic material.
There is also a device that simultaneously blends the finished ice cream into the cream and cools it down to a minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we're not going to avoid any small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit feathers when he gets out of control a huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Double-light auditors
The European Food Authority of EFSA is associated with an industry that experimentes with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of testbiotech experts, which is considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said the head of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday.
Efsa’s leading group of experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other experts in Ephesus have had a contract with the Ilsi lobbyist union for several years.
This one is financed by a company like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way in the Efs control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
Efsa’s rules are consistent throughout the paragraphs with Ilsa’s documents, carrying the industrial manuscript that should be checked by the Italian Parma office.
It is the second time that Testbiotech points to conflicts of interest.
Recently, a high-ranking manager from Ephesus passed without any additions or transitional time to the Swiss Syngenta agrarian company - and thus changed sides.
The Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU's staff link to the Industrial Lobby Control Office, which has aroused interest both in the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't recognize the conflict of interest.
He works with all the serious data, i.e. those from industry, if they are of high quality, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts working for the Efs are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - except for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts like Then criticise that currently genetically modified plants are allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic reactions to the environmental effects are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, will do genetically altered maize in the field," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not yield reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could they be found then?" asked the prosecutor, Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
A scientific employee has been studying genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying as well as in the US, now in Europe too, to increasingly influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are almost no more scientists who would not be connected to the companies.
Most studies are not published that are critical to society.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footwear of stones
Uli Gsell also got some, like, 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the bagras arrived and began to scrape a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar decline in the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He must not disappear."
It's spread out: "The left and the poor stone, the simple and the original."
When one cut open, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What's he gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former depository of French army ammunition, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everyone that came up during a crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they had broken into gravel or disappeared on a dump," she says in her office, a wooden building that was formerly a guard's house.
He was told that he was being handed over and threatened when, in September, it was in all the papers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing from a company that carried out a demolishment.
But he's been talking to his opponents for days with S-21.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the Demolition.
And when it's happening, it's the most reasonable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-operators every one about 80 kilograms of heavy block, price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euro.
As a memory, some are also hoping to bring him back when he was rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest is sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, builders home.
They came from every corner, and they pulled what was in the trunk and the trailer.
The Stuttgart dispute stones have long since turned into "grosses" or as the rims of herbs.
"This stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If only there wasn't a political breakthrough."
He gets in his field car and goes for a ride after his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, he stopped studying, later he stopped biology, then he took an interest in computers, and eventually he became a stone merchant.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40,000 tons of stones in it.
They're sequestering their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
The brakes.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"One of them belonged to the Marian Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone from Labe, yellow, warm, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going up the road through the woods.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe Station.
Go ahead.
"A nice travertine."
One time, they belonged to the Neckarstadion tribune in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police bureau in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbron.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported by means of simple latrines and bull trains, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, he didn't become very rich anymore.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people and, in addition, a stonesmith, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker, and a gardener settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne in due course.
Stones will be saved there, too.
The Battle of High Potential Talents
There's a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students press on bread with salmon, tomato soup and sweetness.
University of Technology in Braunschweig and automobile manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and by the way to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to compete with the smartest heads, as well as the company VW, to succeed and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most gifted graduates in the audience, even before they reach the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in projects oriented to practice and get them.
At TU Braunschweig is trying to get the talent of a car company the second day.
One young lady in the personal department distributes pens, rubber bears and boards with a VW logo.
He tells promising young talent about programs for practice, student jobs and tells them how to go to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who might fit in as a coworker."
Such co-operation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is he's so open-minded about students.
"Otherwise, it was a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is probably going to be even harder.
In many sectors companies are no longer able to select their employees from long groups of candidates.
On the contrary, he must strive and try to attract particularly highly qualified labour.
First of all, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers of VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the lack of engineers will increase even further.
Roman Dykta is looking for a talent hunt for KPMG's audit and advisory firm.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send out eight promising students in the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can check out the KPMG branches and meet the company.
In advance, he will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested will fly to the United States.
In the high potentials fight at universities, they will pay by Dicts still toughen the laws.
"We want to be different from the rest of the race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
It seems Dicta's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants of a similar event last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and are planning to apply for work with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, the small and medium-sized companies present themselves on the labour market.
"We are trying to contact the graduates at the professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, head of the Personnel Department of Solarworld Solar Technology.
Bonn company employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions written on the company's website.
"At the moment, it's just complicated, to occupy vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through university professors.
Solarworld works with various universities, such as Freiberg University.
"Professors report that it is possible for us to do a practice or write a degree job."
The solar specialist doesn't order any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"The big companies often cannot offer it," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
Money has not played a major role in finding work for a long time.
flexible working hours, babysitting or good practice are other critical factors.
Solarworld took place in a study of the Great Place Institute to Work 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, co-workers are asked how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and monitor the working conditions of the staff.
The head of Stübe's personal department hopes that her placement will bring her points for job seekers.
"I believe that applicants are particularly informed about external assessments of the potential employer," he said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer leads through its own employees," he says.
This is called internal Employmenter Branding, i.e. the establishment of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfying employees are the best emissaries."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will make their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a string," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil wells
During the following years, new oil wells will not rise off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government issued an appropriate ban - and thus terminated the earlier plans with effect.
Also, new wells are banned from the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signalled the pressure of opposition and industry's willingness to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates are thus trying to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The focus of criticism is the British energy BP, which is confronted by billions of requests.
The investigation committee commissioned by Obama should submit the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the drilling ban he had paid since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters with stricter controls and security regulations.
At present, the control office is fundamentally reformed, which has brought many corruption charges to bear.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would eliminate the lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest barrier to gas and oil industry growth", the result of an ongoing survey by BDO consulting firm before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change in regulation."
Investments in new mining projects continue until appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of liquid oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," calms the environmental activist journalist: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of your lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian observed an attempt to photograph a boy walking around his chest with water surrounded by smooches: the scene acts in a watercan with rainbow colors almost as nice.
The fact that the brown clots of oil float beneath the surface cannot be seen.
She used to collect enough garnels here, told Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, it became slowly flowing water completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil poured into the vast wet region from broken management.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni region, located in the heart of the delta of the Niger River, belongs to one of the world's worst polluted areas.
Through the river mangrove swamps with lots of lateral inflows, the whole range of the trigger is only known.
The engine on the boat cooks a brown porridge instead of light water, and the one who dips his hand in the water pulls out his oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves come from the ground as black sticks of the licorice, rarely letting their leaves hang sadly.
We are vainly looking for the flock of birds, which usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will dissolve in a former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
"What happens here is the ecological leadership of the war," says Sad Celestine Akpobari, "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with war is justified.
The area of settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first winners from Europe gathered here, where in the 1980s the first resistance was created with the later executed writer Ken Sara-Wiwa, here had to stop his production in 1993 because it was very dangerous for the employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni region: while it is daily extracting from the whole delta of the three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining gardens and 7000 kilometres of lead over two million barrels of black gold, there is an oil field in the Ogoni Lada area, this situation is very unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters span from the water of the steel structure like bizarre statues: "Christmas Trees", so they are called very gently the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, mostly cut to the sea.
Every moment, such a head of a drilling hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil flowed into the delta into the ecosystem over 50 years ago: Every year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea in Alaska during the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes as to who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While the Shell Group refers to sabotage and organized oil theft by more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental security officials are talking about the cracking heads of wells and intrusive guides as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than in the world, said the US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of water disorders is "sometimes higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like abandoned oil, a dirty workshop under the wide sky emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many vessels, which are partly connected by guidance, partially dispersed on the ground, the fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil heats up in the fire court for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, it flows from lead to a captured pot of gasoline, later drops at the end of the lead kerosene and eventually oil.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce 300 litres each day: "We make 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents use chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The mixed low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still be exceeded by illegal producers: they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers", which are connected to leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the entire delta of the Niger River is lost to the country every day at least 16 million litres of oil.
But only a negligible small part of the prospectively stored raw materials will illegally embellish: The largest share will fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and the high position of military representatives, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
Whether the inhabitants caused the disaster and their interventions or the easy way to produce them, Akpobari is considered purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't considered to be intruders, and if they hadn't completely destroyed the life of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refinery."
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship to Shell is so depraved that it only seems to be the departure of the company: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will show themselves as better."
Michael's gonna be upset.
"The best time to disappear," says the muscle manufacturer.
"At any moment, soldiers may come."
If they were found by a special military unit, they would not be threatened by prison, but by a painful bribe.
Also soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"Then the cursed thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 appears to have a major security malfunction.
The investigators found out during a search of the machine that was emergency landing, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Air Company wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers were probably happier at the start of November than they had known: the Australian Air Safety Authority discovered a major safety malfunction on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations and is now warning against a possible construction error.
Perhaps the problem would have serious consequences: on one oil link, cracks could arise due to weariness, this Thursday in the published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the airbus of Qantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against this company.
Chief of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and the surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage as burning oil.
After this event, it must be replaced worldwide by up to 40 engines.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesman ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficit was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 transitionals on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-story plane is the largest personal plane in the world.
National snowfall causes chaos in transport
Germany in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, train connections and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: nearly the whole Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing snow temperatures - which leads to a lot of traffic chaos.
In the north and east, it lies in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several highways and many roads there is a very limited right.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still on site, but it did not control the newly snow.
In addition, there was a strong striking wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Authority for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy rush with a water status of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast in Schlesvik-Holštynsk.
Snow curtains caused considerable problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the bad weather centre Meteomedia was therefore the highest level of alarm in the Saxon Switzerland.
Some 30 centimeters of new snow came from there, and strong and fresh winds caused the curtains.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhaltsk, police authorities reported major road problems.
On A2 caused the wind and snow slow traffic and congestion.
Durinsk was in trouble because of the snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German track, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhaltsk, Durinsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and bends.
Remote traffic had to be stopped in Saxony from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Durin, Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers received on the train from firefighters and rescuers of wool blankets, food and drink.
Snowwind waves across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled because of the winds of the great German airports.
According to the flight information centre's spokesman, Munich's cancelled flights have already been reported.
In Frankfurt our Mohan has been cancelled according to the spokesman Fraport for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
There are few passengers at the airport without connections, but 400 beds are ready for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Due to a snowy road there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after turning into a slippery road at Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light dust, and that is why it will rise even when the wind is light.
But the wind will go down.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be quick winds with the force of the wind.
But it's going to be a big winter, locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for towers-doubles
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye to his sign: according to one newspaper article, the buyer's bank is looking for two towers with the headquarters in Frankfurt.
The real estate could amount to up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: towers-doubles in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernised; while bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, apparently, he wants the financial cost of renovation back again - and is looking for a buyer for both clouds, according to the Financial Times Deutschland, with appeal to the spokesman.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the sale planned.
"We are still exploring whether they are more meaningful to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This gives up again the largest credit institution in Germany after a short period of time.
The bank only took over the towers-doubles in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and subsequently cost-renovated them.
The energy restructuring has been estimated at around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper text, the value of the meanwhile renamed towers to "Greenovers" at the price of around 500 million euros.
The speaker said that it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the assets of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of the sleepy miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions down below.
Still, it has not been possible to liberate the dead because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried at the bottom.
The shaft where there was trouble was a launch probe, but it didn't reveal any trace of life.
Because of the high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, they could not withdraw lifesaving forces for safety reasons.
Second, strong detonation was based on authorities and experts from the fact that miners no longer have a chance of survival.
Still couldn't free the dead.
Now they have honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the fallen miners, 29 tables were built, on them helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Pictures and personal items, such as clothing and surfboards, have found their place here.
There were flags on half-herds on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out again from the "deep ground" to the surface, Minister John Key said to participants in the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say good-bye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Laurie Drew, whose son, Zen, was plunged down.
Several foreign diplomats took part, apart from the Prime Minister and related victims.
During the explosion of November 19th, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Rescuers began by putting fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gases dissolve, it starts cooling high temperatures in the bottom, told reporters police President Gary Knowles.
To hell, warriors!
Is the horror at the art theater?
Director Nicolas Winging Refn is trying to overcome the old border again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winging Refn mean when he was shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and kills almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody events because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies even living inside his belly when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other figures will carry at least one or two sentences or let themselves be torn down to passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, they remain silent and rot in the dreadfully beautiful hilly countryside of Scotland, which offers a world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult enthusiasts of cinema with an interest in existentialism and very calm footage of the camera.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a Danish version of the director Quentin Tarantina, but Stoicki prevents his works from approaching either more humor to the main stream or less brutality of the artistic audience.
Most of the fans of art cinema seem to be discouraged by spraying brains and interiors everywhere.
The supporters of action films will be bored no later than the moment when the One Eye is released for free reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will hang forever in the wind and the fog before the men are likely to sail to America and remain silent there.
So there's nothing to be surprised that "Walhalla Rising" didn't get into the movies in Germany and was now only released on DVD.
It is a pity mainly for beautiful images, but also because it hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention behind a special facade, places that are broken down by blood.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact story, it's all an atmosphere, a fever dream, which has become a movie.
And that's not for the viewer to escape.
The ref doesn't allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his frozen images and the cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially but an indescribable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Eye, keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become the time for enemies and transitional allies by the warrior of hell, perhaps the messenger of the devil.
It creates destruction, perhaps but also for the corrupt.
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Landwork
The IAEA Nuclear Power Authority has been alerted to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country is defending expression - and it won't even allow control.
Around midnight of 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter aircraft will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest big city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), its name appears when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that is turning away from the current.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American Foreign Secret Service of the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of El-Kibar, would have been well suited to the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The 50-year-old tech's no good at anything else.
The CIA has presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it explained where which components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it should be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, photographs were submitted that showed the building nearby or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before launch, but without fuel lines.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, there's not much more to the story than that, even the arguments have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently announced in his memory that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building an El-Kibar reactor, but in fact it had no basis for the country's "active nuclear weapons program".
Some secret service rapporteurs in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of "the alleged reactor", even though the CIA presentation is considered "certain".
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
On the question of how confident he is that the reactor is ahead of him, the UN senior diplomat replied in summer, saying that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The "unused military buildings" were said to have been quickly cleared, and they also properly adjusted the terrain.
However, in June 2008 the IAEA team, led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen, managed to find traces of uranium produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial sellers through the Member State from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more prestigious than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it had never had a secret nuclear program and had not even built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, says Damascus.
But that's what turned the IAEA back on particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters - as well as satellite images.
In addition, it prohibited auditors from carrying out a second inspection in El-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-up building.
But Israel is also silently silent.
"We will never comment," the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed recently.
The investigation of this case has so far been ongoing since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as the high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - it is a serious breach of the nuclear weapons ban treaty to which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter of three other devices, which are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and they still exist as opposed to it.
To date, the auditors have not indicated any equipment, function or suspicion.
According to news reports Süddeutsche Zeitung is the IAEA internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, back to nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason Syria rejects the approach of the IAEA to these three places.
In Vienna it was heard that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been sent in advance by the US to search military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to a U.S. secret service facility.
The IAEA has the background and satellite images that between these three places and the square at Euphrates transported the material here and there.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one arranged should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there are no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium is to be decomposed into a bomb, only probable estimates exist on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important traces is hidden in these three places.
It's like they've disappeared from the surface of the Earth's hundreds of cargo trucks, and no one seems to have any information about where that substance came from.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates lying salt mine al-Tibni, which had Syria checked as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA to be unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with a reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from the universe show that after IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all the suspected groundwork sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify suspicion.
In addition, there are diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for the auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only this effort shows how much the auditor's interest is.
In the meantime, Damascus rejected this proposal.
If the Western diplomats in Vienna have calmed down a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, and that is why it does not burn, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means the Viennese nuclear agency has to enforce controls.
The head of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already talked about the "options to which he is cloned" yet he hesitates.
This choice poses a great risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council needs to do so, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens when they find nothing?"
Love at Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless directorship in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote her own script, it's a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
There is much more to know - but it also causes anxiety.
They insist that the woman who is Muslim falls in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian Women's Associations protested immediately, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary moved rapidly.
In the meantime, the film has been completed in Hungary and is in post-production, but still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN-Organization for Help of UNHCR Jolie Refugees and requested a meeting with an actress, now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also a UN ambassador to help refugees.
Not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where the rapes took place, the love stories failed, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims was quite clear about the script.
Her organisation therefore recommended to the UN organisation to help refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian informs.
What exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received a reading of its script, allowed for smaller raids in Sarajevo shooting - it is not clear why Jolie did not come after that.
The young author emphasises that in her film she does not follow any political intentions that she has devoted much effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to its contents, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that it is under pressure that "is not fair and based on incorrect information".
Now they can free her from the hackers of Hollywood: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
It's good for Iry again this evening.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy for the sound of loud music, butt-footed.
Bailey-Pub in south-earth Cork is boiling because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups - and hit each other.
"Driving Pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to do so a ticket to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screaming beer game and a restrained computer player, it doesn't work too well together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain, to respond to the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a game of passion in Las Vegas, he's going to an interview in January for New Zealand.
"It makes me feel so strange," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job yet."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "at once she got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of their bad prospects at home, they've tried their luck abroad for two of Tanner's three siblings.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT partner in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in due course, and experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin are predicting.
They count even by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar migratory wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of increase, which brought great prosperity to Ireland, dissatisfaction is on the increase again.
The economic crisis is especially affecting young, educated Irys, who have only experienced a rise so far.
The loss of employment and the social downturn seemed absurd these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, there are three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 without a job.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain, "In Ireland, everything goes uphill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please shut down."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government says she is only lying, and young people are not offering any prospects for the future.
"They correct minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20th.
She's watching her classmates go from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she's going to have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market work abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are pictures of surfers in Australia and snowboard skiers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
About what it's like to build something else, he's known about Sean O'Donovan for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts so he can pay home loan for the house.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time it crosses the threshold of its own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not really in."
He laughs in despair and walks in cool rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 per cent funded by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't have to go well with the loan?
O'Donov is thinking for a while, he's having hot tea and he says, "I don't have kids that I have to live and I'm young; even though things go wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaining that he hears so often now.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life moved on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keeping the future open and simply waiting for life to develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is another thing that worries him quite a bit these days: his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might go to a bachelor party.
"No emotion," he says, and he drinks a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a party to leave, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Regular practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Criminal activity raises more fears than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current survey of Latinobarometer, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in positions across the whole area.
Two related matters dominate this year's survey, which took place in September and early October.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific has increased significantly in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is on average 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those asked in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular areas, are democratic beliefs, which is the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to the year 2001 when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graph 3).
About 34% stated that they trust the snow in their country and 45% trust the government, again it is the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by an economic crisis.
The aid arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again to 32% in this year.)
But the mood changes in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Luly da Silva is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more serious and the state of violent crime worsened.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America have seen crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or their relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of last year's data and is also the lowest since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents (as opposed to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical choices
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The elections meant filling the urns and repeating ballots, ballots scattered across channels, broken election rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several anticipated forerunners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for an end to the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mullet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, were necessary, should not have ended the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is scheduled to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelli, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, withdrew from their original call to make the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has small or negligible support among voters, is referred to by the election commission for achieving a decisive fight.
Because of the control of the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that the election will be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards required for the vote remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
It is clear, then, that the Haitians are going to go after it themselves.
By the peaks to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, has benefited from public sympathy, when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in next year's elections may depend on whether grieving Mrs. Fernández gives up her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
That made it possible for the first couple to spend more income on a personal basis.
The government of Mrs. Fernández lost most of it last year in Congress.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at Mr Kirchner's death on the 27th of October.
Some members of the Peronist ruling political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (which resulted in the beating and charging of the government from corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I don't want to talk," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also pay for next year, with the president having more space to spend according to his will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely to grow this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts speak of a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina had narrowed its economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned the INDIC, a statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández ease this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private businesses and union foreclosures.
And her officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has disrupted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Mrs. President Fernández is letting her know that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government made an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
President Fernández now faces the agreement with the creditors' governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which is owed about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be monitored by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer price index, which would be a reminder of the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not clear yet whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office, when the husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of a middle class that is tired of chirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to give up the many opinions her husband has maintained in politics.
Half-encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those entitled, elected mayors and city councils on 27 November in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeo.
President Ma himself represents the feelings that prevail over the mainland and have a strong impact on business relations, including the agreement on partially free trade, in the greatest comparison with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the mayor's five offices, it could not win by a majority of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is favored by Taiwan's greater independence, obtained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it was the presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the vote of his party has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was a party together with KMT in city councils.
The elections took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include loud election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with slowly dressed girls.
In part, there was even a mysterious attempt at assassination.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for KMT candidates in the eve of elections.
The man shot the young Mr. Lien right across the face, hurt him, and killed the audience.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the gunman intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any event, Tsai Ing-wen, Head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only big winner of the campaign.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates fell for plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
Therefore, the KMT has a tendency to avoid associating with the government in Beijing.
But this time, DPP also dropped the awakening of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact that China's trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue its commercial fees, together with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Surely they would also like to see political integration, but in a row.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a stormeer and a advocate of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is temperate, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was summoned as DPP's candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-hang, who was the office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations could take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai informs the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustful alternative" to Mr Ma's accelerated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's ratings were bad, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and a deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT spokesman says he's reorganising his office, just like the local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals in support of Taiwan for the establishment of friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return has passed."
Grammy Award Nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
A statement at the request of the President and people must legally notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer that President Obama chose to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is described as one of Grammy's surprise prizes this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a famous character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy's rules, where an artist must not release more than three albums before "the artist's public identity is established."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward, and thanks to its carefree vocal style and shaky hands with elements of pop, fun and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for those voting in Grammy, who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other judges of Grammy rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing album riding, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophone player James Moody's "Moody 4B" and the keyboardist John Beasley's "Positolotly."
Thrombone Shorty, a snorting New Orleans favorite and frequent HBO guest "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The savage group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of the steampunk gained several merited recognition in the category of large files, when in competition the chamber jazz Childs Enemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a band.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The lead in the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" as piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominated members of South California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer, based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto, also has a chance to value it.
The nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symphony Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebow Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the project Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
Regarding the category of opera, nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaya Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Marinesky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered in Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the tactics of Esa-Pek Salonena.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work especially for Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with tone from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination were the pianoists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented this year among the nominated vocal soloists, including Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the transition category, soprano Jessie Norman won the nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula receives approval of the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on a Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews you will remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening, and it lasted almost midnight, when most of the time it took discussion with the people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprises.
The discussion continued on the news website.
"There is no more America," came one comment.
"We are the Planet of Monkeys with the Statue of Liberty fall into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, a tragedy scene that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
At Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmousz condemned the violence.
His religious community, reading about 135 families, had spent years without an incident in Riverside County, but wished for a larger and more suitable space than the storage space that he had rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
A new mosque with dimensions of 24,943 square footprints in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take up 4.32 acres to Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new life types on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has opportunities that stand beyond the main elements that have been considered so far and fundamental.
"This organism has dual abilities."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that it is a form of really 'memory' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
Scientists, however, have discovered that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"It will start to surprise you as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the news.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on the Earth.
However, the news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, caused widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that stimulate biochemistry and that the set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high arsenic levels.
Arzen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, thus considering that a microbial exposed to both elements may be able to replace one another.
"Arzen is toxic mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"The arsenic, however, is so different that as phosphorus does not work. When it gets into the organism, it begins to work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
The microbes grow better when phosphorus is applied, but since they can also survive with a replacement of arsenic, there is an increased possibility that the life form used by arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but never found an example on which this fact could be proven.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used in earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not only in the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team, said.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The other two of the four dog shows that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff reported on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akits and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities reported.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs were later Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which location he did not share detailed information about their whereabouts.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught up in the case.
They were very happy to see their two trinkets found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, Trace's three-year-old dog and Didi's 10-month-old female, were unharmed, the authorities reported.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to take part this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained uninhabited until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show off Trace.
Other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times daily on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop at nearly a month's travel pair after dog shows.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard signed up for a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs — a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brettan ogre — who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left it in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6am on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who introduces them to missing dogs, dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether prices would be granted.
The Lev is ready to scream again now that the MGM restructuring has been granted final approval by the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green company to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge of New York officially blessed the "front packaged" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt and thus clear the way for 86 years of an old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and television shows.
By Thursday's return that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Rules of Procedure, there are no legal obstacles to relaunching the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the reduced study.
The number of employees falls roughly to 320 from the original over 400.
MGM does not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's a link to an investment bank that needs $75 million itself, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management struggled to allow interest payments of $300 million per year.
On August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelse and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed that they would sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion in US dollars plus the financials required by creditors.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
In the coming weeks, when MGM officially rises from the audition, Moelse and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., already receiving $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies that cash in for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, called "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which produced only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films, which will be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the financing of two films, the book "Hobit" will be presented in front of them, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to set up a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debts, sought the possibility of combining study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys that keep your budget on gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 coral screws or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law worked; this year's technology toys had far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While there are relatively fewer new toys with associated websites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the toy with charging batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
On one touch, the animal gives a tone, and the second press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start to pull, you cannot stop.
Best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year I borrowed 14 inch animatrix doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play the game Simon Says and can also walk a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children test Mickey's dancing instructor toy, though their parents complain of lack of volume control.
If you're a child in the '80s, you might remember Alpha, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn car driving into fun with work with a self-reliant, funny workbook.
If you're going crazy about your kid's smartphone, there's three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years of age) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years of age), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on the SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are not bigger than a matchbox, each having a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it is great for competition in improvised word formation.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toys.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credit at Club Penguin store to store on any two items.
This could include a wheel skate or a Puffle pet.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush brush brush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest of a series of microbots on a button battery.
The bug moves fast on 12 vibrational silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
He's also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time in the crowd of our dog.
The introduction of softer police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, scrutinized his orders and issued orders in half with military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese permanent enforcers of urban order, feared and disdained for their hard actions and their desire for violence - to give some impression on the noises of the crowds.
Stand straight!
"Hurry up!"
Show them the whisper of silence, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants have stood by.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the truth.
The four headgear perfectly sits on hair that are perfectly bound with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"The models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive a picture of city overseers in China.
One city ordered that the new goalkeepers have higher education.
Guangdong Province changed gray-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan replaced his reticenced view of the heavy weaponry in central China: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers were encircled by a cart with snacks and looked intently at the owner after half an hour of packing and leaving.
Xindu, the city district with 680,000 people in Chengdu chose surgery as the main painting.
Since 2003, the district has complemented its urban police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show the softer, feminine side besides the grosser side of the police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
They would argue critics for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province pushed an unattended viewer to death after using his cell phone to film how they were doing in a protest against the dump.
Last year, police training in Beijing took place, and the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual described, among other things, how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, a suspicious trader with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, shows Chinese police officers attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, complained last year after further discussions on tactics.
The paper was "really thorough clearance."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial of The Beijing Evening News dealt with the question of whether women have real duties or are only distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The period required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five features of the face in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 metres.
Service at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Functioners claim that work is too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com as if they were government websites.
"Candidates must first prove external qualities which then define others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes character and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, and he added, "In addition to being bounds, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the county city management, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the height requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both genders.
Just like the demand for face-to-face symmetrical features.
Which means that the question of good eyesight is among the Chinese under discussion.
Medically disabled or ill-advised will certainly not be applicable.
"Can't let a chrome or hunched man serve us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like an apple and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't believe that the emphasis on her looks could have a sexist attitude, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the Dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the picture of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just to drive traders into streets where they can carry out their activities.
Each morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings as possible and bowls of tofu before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you this many times already!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run, and for a time left his bike with a wheelchair with noodles.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than pressing.
"Every day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"A great routine."
One reason is that female police officers have no authority as their male counterparts to confiscate the goods.
They can only threaten to report this fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, were alarmed after false rumors of police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or officers were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were turned over or burned.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where the police patrol patroled that morning, gathered more than 50 people on the corner of the street.
The cops confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The wheel owner could have been crying all he wanted.
A 15-minute standoff from the police, the face-to-face, the elbows against the vehicles, and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a role to play.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and smoothing image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said in fact.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign.
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge concerning his affair with the former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, the non-Ada republican, faced and which, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican candidate for the President for 2012. His affair has reached national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that the decision followed almost a year's investigation was "certainly pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the ethics committee of the Senate.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there is no plan to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the Federal Lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in Ensign's campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and support their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby for them, indicating so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently Mr Ensign's assistant, he was excluded from the law of lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethical experts argue that Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who had been friends before the affair, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence published "it turned out to be a clear case of the preparation of violations of the law," said Stanley Brand, Washington's lawyer, who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious in terms of political complaints, after a large number of misdemeanours, including the decision to suspend the action against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of the charges against the state's representation.
The Federal Prosecutors "clearly hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the matter.
"It shows essentially that on high-ranking government officials, the laws do not apply," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief lawyer, said in his interview that on Monday he had been called by the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice and then the second day thereafter, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defence team cooperates with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in the mid-term statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had presented to state representatives.
"I am not pleased to share the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decisions," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the independent complaint investigation, in which the ethnic group charged that the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents to the 96,000 dollars was violated by federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main non-Aid society that had long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to work as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "builed" to the Ministry of Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr Hampton and another non-Aidian client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton for lobby work.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned to his post as the fourth republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the crime of his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hopes that the ethical commission will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nebad people," she said.
The challenge of the municipality of Cheshire turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them wrote in the courtroom.
A minute later, they were sending reports of terrible testimony on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 messages on Twitter have been dealt with by raping and tying children to beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, there was a trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and was scheduled to be officially terminated by imposing the death penalty for which the jury voted.
However, Mr Hayes's lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that would likely have been employed by the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "Circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disturbing details then led the jury to decide in terms of public opinion influence.
This claim could lead the judge to consider whether new rules in the courtroom should also be required with regard to the introduction of new technologies.
"As I have experienced in this conversion, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ulmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the Jon C. Blue Supreme Court trial briefly rejected the allegations of last week's revenue and that the media were "specially controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts acknowledged that the reporting of known cases could raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a court order of 1966, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the Sheppard versus Maxwell case, the process was "carnaval atmosphere" due to the media.
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration for the television show and the film "The Runaway".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that reviewed Hayes's judgment half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courtroom, which was unimaginable in Dr Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said that it had been carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtroom could make the process fairer.
The case of Twitter is only one of many filmed lawyers, Mr. Hayes, who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
For example, the defendants also claim that in the case of Mr Hayes, it may be preconceived when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photographs of terror when choosing a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the photos of the victims that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defendants argue that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury who was critical of the state's representatives and wrongly put pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to last month's verdict that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly fanned the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters before court," the lawyer wrote, "there has been something that has not been seen here in New Haven and may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more disturbing than the reports mentioned later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should be in charge of other trials.
Some lawyers, however, have asked the courts of appeal with often used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Dr Sheppard's judgment, because of the wide scope of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the Sheppard case versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its resentment and negativity, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first real cooperation of two political parties or is it just an illusion moment before the quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any major findings on the core topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion discussing the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the party fill.
The central public meeting of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close collaboration for several months has built mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that the members continue to divide.
And it is quite difficult to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a trial period - they are sounding signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience to the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's proceedings and its subsequent evaluation of participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the ratios that have taken place over the last two years.
Whether it is a question of tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, November's election prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
The election aroused the emotions of the party and then they shut up.
It's okay."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax reduction at the end of the year has expired, and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as a likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because the Republicans cannot see how they support the reduction of taxes on the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment aid.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress calls for January.
It's more likely to be a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After things have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the electorate of tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the risk of exaggeration, know that they must act in accordance with their promises and must reduce government spending and abolish the new Health Care Act.
These attachments are clear in the initial response to the recommendations on deficits, which include reform of the tax code and increases in certain taxes, increasing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their opinion, to put pressure on the issue of deficit to a public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th Member Commission so that they can present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close as possible to the number.
The greatest opposition is between elected jury officials who propose that, in the case of financial matters, we have, at least today, a small basis or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first begins next year in the form of party conflicts, when the Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, tax and health care, followed by a period of greater side cooperation.
What's the cause of the shift?
Public opinion.
There's a lot of evidence that despite the partying in the last election, most Americans want to continue to see the two sides that work together.
If it could be directed toward a path, as it was in 1995, both sides will then follow the public very closely.
Anyone will be threatened by a vote reduction, will likely change the course and will seek compromise.
That might be an optimistic look at the thing.
Foreignism and orientation are now greater than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideologies gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will be a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
An outstanding American document depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues with part of the fees and protection fees that come on the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service have largely held protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will take its own when the money starts moving up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrla, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The recording shall be based on sources whose names have been redesigned.
The recording was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused him of a large proportion of corruption.
He was called off in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in clearance.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges for many years, and won several lawsuits for false charges for such an accusation.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when he was asked about a proven witness to corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's crap."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up to vote.
Of course, it is unusual to meet such details expressed in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also outrageous that they would do so to diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection with criminal animals have led some to call it 'disfunctional' and confirm that the government works more as kleptokrats than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'krysha' (the term from the world of criminal and mafia, which literally means 'the roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of the State Attorney, as well as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"The analysts have identified a three-stage structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and Militia are second-degree."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in certain areas, since the city does not provide certain services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Sales owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more than from organised criminal groups), since they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, the protection itself may already be in difficulty; even those who pay may be arrested at times.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their trades are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but he admitted that he had made only a little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably incendiary cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that Russia’s corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by non-governmental organizations Transparency International (the countries are classified from at least the most corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy report, which appeared in Moscow until late evenings, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Moscow's shortcomings could be blamed for Luzhkov, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue in the matter of solving the problem.
During the interview for CNN with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeits and responded in anger to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is our mutual co-operation, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a disputed lighted concrete textbook with dirty and peeled walls reminded the school director Anlong Veng High School of the man who built it, leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his cruelty during the government of the Red Khmers, remains the commander in this remote country of the Red Khmers in northwest Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers surrendered to the government, it is a rife long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng as well.
In April, the victims of the Truth Forum and reconciliation were allowed to confront publicly the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court, together, will be the first to condemn a former member of the Red Khmers, the verdict of a former leader, the notorious Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, there was a growing unrest between Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"There is anger and fear among the former Red Khmers, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life between the Red Khmers was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates families."
During the government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved to death, disease or processing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara ran partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, following a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government that culminated in the 1996 surrender of Ieng Sara and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their monks no longer cherished them, most of the former Red Khmer warriors descended into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouges held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people have only benefited minimally from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs the public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under Red Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we must ensure everything ourselves."
The ongoing court of the Khmer Rouge has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will start investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Khmers.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether or not it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm the anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the government of the Red Khmers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project on which thousands of forced workers were likely killed.
A recent steaming evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden cottage on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past between the Red Khmers.
If the court had called her in, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If further prosecutions appear, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is only what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Peace in Khmer terms means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre published the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, has 75 pages and has the title "The History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng also knew only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the link between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are going to prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the textbooks and the court are beginning to influence, said further.
The Red Khmers here still have a strong spell.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains Mountains is a road planted with weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black pots, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pota here was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and was scheduled to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of mature bananas in hopes of bringing her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are giving up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton's Security Summit and by the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up the highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that it had hit a rock of injury last spring.
But American officials have told The Washington Post that in the last two months, several undercover operations have been conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the land for the medium-term agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under an anonymous condition, because it was a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of the 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, at which Belarus was expelled.
And it was probably a good move to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 nuclear security summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to dispose of all their highly enriched uranium supplies.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko then said.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States several months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and liquidation facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was airtight, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million for the programme, most of it to deliver less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 lbs of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, especially because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But a mid-term statement suggests a gradual thaw.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that stricter respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't work with CIA flights.
The Spanish government did not make any valuables regarding CIA flights carrying captured Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda to Guantánama through Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This is due to the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it is also written that the then first representative of Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vega requested that the Spanish execution be informed and "could thus show that she has proper surveillance of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe which accused a dozen States, including Spain, of co-operating with human rights violations, a meeting was held between Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Veg.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "exempted Zapater's government from the game" and insisted Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "unprepared", Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
At the same time, Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated to the US Ambassador that the Spanish government "had intended to give this matter as low as possible, but that the case was in the hands of the judges had limited room power".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as it is concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to ask for the secret documents of the National Centre of Secret Services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating component or any sensitive information", the Embassy explained after the interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concerns more about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the secret information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
On the occasion of the lunch of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba in March 2007, this ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had already instructed his fellow workers "to avoid divisive comments with a view to reducing tensions".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party's actions, Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - recant.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Party Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if this finding could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
The confessed murderous mother complained about the network of the mother's "age"
A young woman talked about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Terror by Galician"
Minica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least once a friend with this nickname, which she used from the village of Noia in La Korunya, from which the young woman came.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the wife’s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They've been dating for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his newborn child was born, but his ex-girlfriend never let her run a DNA test.
You've found a new way to get to know each other.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma to visit her for a week.
However, the content of its communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's all alone on Menorce, and she says, "Alberto's upset that I went to work."
"When I told him, he seemed good, but now he realizes he has to be with a kid all day long and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May he talks about his return to his place of residence: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th, because I have to go to work so that I don't miss this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he takes his son with him.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be with me, and it'll never happen again in my life that I'll leave him with someone other than my mother," a questionable intention given her bad relations.
There's another post in July.
When she tweets this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was likely murdered by 10, is already dead.
"The Emperor is pleased on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On one side he's with me and he actually likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"I'm going to go to summer school and save some money for the nanny."
Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
"A big kiss from Cesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what kind of videos on the e-mail, see how he wants, fit with me, sex is necessary."
On the thirtieth, another report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
There are Mónic's contributions on the blogs of dedicated animes and manzas.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Mookie ex-con."
"Terror by Galician (Motto)".
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses her pity and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday, where she came from the Menorce detention center.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "she didn't mean to hurt the kid somehow."
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Cesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
The D.A. and the D.A. are demanding psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 chairs and PSC in the House (Socialist Party Catalanska - late) would lose 9 mandates.
with results from November 28th, the PP party could have the main word at the councils in Lérid, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (The People's Party of Catalonia - psst. pst.) already has an idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually one of these against the election of the Catalans.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610.473 votes in general elections, while in the 2006 elections the figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People’s Party of Catalan Republic) received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, supported by the PSC vote and the loyalty of the PP voters, was maintained, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared to the current 8, CIU (Convergence and Union, Czech Conciliation and Union) would also gain 4 mandates (now it has 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential to PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers Party).
According to this analysis of the human beings, the Party of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - late) would lose one Member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - recast).) would still have one mandate, or would have another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of general elections, where human beings could also have a decisive impact on the end of the Socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most expected administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose city halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Léida and Geronia, where socialists would not receive the majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, ERC and ICV.
Given the debacle of the republics, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representation - as at least 5% of the votes need to be obtained.
The PP has increased the number of votes obtained in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérid and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the Tarragona turnout, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ross has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Humans have also obtained from other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels, and Reus.
At present, PP has representations at 34 councils in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell has provided Al-Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to seven detained in Barcelona, another three were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which provided travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda, including "Tigs of Liberation of Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second group appointed was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, through "Operation Kampai", the weakening of Al-Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus at international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
The investigators estimate that the cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand within two years when it was active in Catalansk, where they were subsequently counterfeited and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization so that their "warring men" could travel unpunishedly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active cell that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore these investigations, in addition to Thai services, were also attended by other European police units, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another developed in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
They were the men who were driving from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was destroyed in 2009, stole, in particular, tourism passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that documents had to be valid for men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and had to be free from marked visas.
The investigation documents point out that so far there are no facts that would link those detained from Catalonian with the assassination in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalan to the transfer agency about a thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) asks Mass to stop fiscal agreement
PPC President Alicia Sánchezov-Camachová was given the opportunity yesterday to give personally to Arthur Mass her terms under which she is willing to support his introduction to the presidency of the Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and abandon risky businesses such as the economic agreement which the leader of nationalists wishes to propose during his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan people arrived at a meeting with Arthur Mass with a certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in the elections from last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory to win a favor, so the CIU candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to abstain from voting on his achievement at the office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when general elections are held, but so far the discussions that Mas is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for President PP, in order to receive her support for the appointment, "will have to end all sovereign and liberating speeches" as well as with an economic agreement - similar to that of Baskick - which the leader of the CIU even wanted to vote on in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the excessive political system of autonomous administration and reduce hereditary and donor taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass's inclusion will be dealt with within the framework of the PP Jordi Cornet and the Dollars Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporto (Solidariat Catalana).
The director of geriatric equipment assures that the deaths were not caused by "the lack of measures"
Olot Centre performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to determine what damage caused the institution of the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who, while being employed here, killed at least eleven seniors who were in charge.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala came in charge of the lawyer of the facility, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "by offering the house of La Caritat it would be possible to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for killing, but "lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to damaging the good name that this institution can suffer because it has not in time revealed the criminal activities of the caregiver, the large threat to the home of La Caritat now poses the requirements for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered exhumation of eight home clients' bodies for seniors with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had looked at the deceased personally, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled by telephone.
La Caritat rejected this extreme through her director yesterday and stressed that "the lack of measures could in no way have been the cause of what had happened".
The lawyer La Caritat added that "there are no indications in the case that, apart from the accused's own, any third party would be in doubt".
The man now named "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and stated that he had committed the first crime on August 29th 2009 and killed the second woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death by taking too high a dose of insulin, as opposed to the first case when using a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to check the staff's access to medicine.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases from the nine drugs that this caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killing them by lying, as he already admitted in the case of the three women killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, they do not believe medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he has confessed to, and justify his behaviour in various versions, which Vila gave to the court knowing that he must change his conduct when it turns out that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to enlighten the entire scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Yesterday, investors reacted sharply to the threat of yesterday's President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differentials were closed by force and the shares of the European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the inequitable market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time to lose his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to call back fourthly within two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the sovereign debt recovery plan for the inefficiencies and elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within a period of time and to maintain unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted "at least until March" and to hold a three-month auction with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and even announce its intensification.
If it fails to meet the expectations created, it will re-create the market response from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God is with us!
The same was true at a May convention where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and durable.
In May, the armory fist announced on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many, causing further market collapse.
Yesterday's bid for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood on the market that was taking place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent roughly 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, with a chance of becoming private capital by February, otherwise they will be lost.
Although Ireland has no credibility since the problem did not reveal stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable and will help reduce uncertainty under the aid plan.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by parliament and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to prevail in Ireland.
Angela Merkel eased her tone of speech to ease the tension in her face for the next EU summit held on December 14th, where it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are union and we are all on a single ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Odo for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister was given the opportunity to present yesterday a plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to investors' ears this sounds like the four annual period since Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, twice as many as the other European stock exchange.
Unlike February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we seem to have benefited from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key bond auction for three years, which will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be a great demand for it, which will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Requesting a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times as high rates in March - and we would have had a son die access to the markets.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to be that".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's children's actions
Storms in open conflict within the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, are silent.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he has considered him to be "totally insignificant", El Enebro's legal action scheduled for 16th this month and the required five of his seven descendants, on which they should attempt to force their majority and strengthen themselves with the help of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José set up a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the biggest business service holding company does not seem willing to delve into his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants, who were named forerunners during the meeting of shareholders on January 18th of this year and whose objection is expressed in the Trade Register.
The trial of El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by the official of the Court of Commerce No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunderbolt in the Álvarez family.
Appeals to the judge are the only legal means to resolve the dispute, which guarantees the commission's call.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquirizo considered David Álvarez to be "the desperate means of his five children serving by means of a judicial lie and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the 18 January negotiations, which was totally invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack on this case as "a completely insignificant one".
Alone, the protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to summon the court in June.
In El Enebro, owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, he controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge in the conversion of the question of judicial assault. The date of the conversion has not yet been fixed.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes improvement in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new incoming team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernanda Alonsa.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine, which drives his car, in Formula 1 the legend was born - the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into Red Bull's hands to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software that simulates the marches that the German company placed on the market in 2007 for the purpose of very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy races and in high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous useful Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this software has enabled Red Bull to perform "in the course of several hours, in almost real time" modifications and refinements which are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of vehicle modification.
The head of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical requirement is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend every period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up about 50 km from London a race of top technology to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings in which visitors are restricted - then particularly journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 persons including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's hero is in Formula 1 without a doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, with the immeasurable technological means that the energy brand has placed in its participation in racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose aid is invaluable, and no one knows them.
The Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the 50 % victory and the rest was credited to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technologies are worth 85% success while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, since they are "unforeseen gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own-trades in cooperation with local distributors over two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first to open up to 80-100 m2 of the network, which this multinational is planning to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Ingles.
Spanish Vice-President HP Helena Herrerová set an example of a newly rebuilt sale on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest, Romania, and in Belgrade, Serbia, the trade in Barcelona is therefore third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other shops would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP personnel systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening trade will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises on an exclusive design of the equipment of shops (with products that can be used on an interactive basis), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also concerned with providing staff for business.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive network of sellers aims to "enhance customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, serving, after-sales services and even packaging".
The Barcelona business is part of a global pilot pioneer program aimed at solving possible problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So we'll be able to solve in 10 minutes problems that may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have contractual technical assistance services," Helena Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell bets he "stolen" in three years to his competitors millions of clients
Optimistic rather than other chiefs, a delegated member of the Banco Sabadell Board, Jaime Guardola, believes that 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it does count on a reduction in interest rates, which, however, will try to compensate by lowering bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to get a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new strategic plan with effect for three years.
The goal is, apart from survival without the need to turn to public aid in the FROB, to gain market share by catching up with a million new private clients - in particular 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank - since up to now and i the Constitution was more procrastinated by small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than small clients.
This year, it has already acquired a bank of 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or can be said to be sober, in order to reduce the costs the bank will show when it presents the results over the period.
A few banking institutions at this time dare to set their targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has changed all plans of world banking.
Sabadell closed his programme this year, set out four years ago, although originally it was three years old, but the situation in the markets required an extension to the next period.
Customers who leave their associates will be their main target group.
At the meeting organised by the API, the Guardian insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, it is believed that the path from the crisis in Spain "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the banking sector's survival, he added.
And although they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - yields, the price of the premium for the risk that banks and depositors pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction of the margin.
"The subject of liquidity and funding is structural and will represent a stress factor on credits."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," he admitted.
Banesto has already issued his network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 November and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now the reduction of commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of the Bank of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usually the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not for nothing ensure that in Spain "they will demand greater sizes".
"The next year he won't stay on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "decreased appropriately" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
It shows that the FROB can support fund-raising on the market before the new capital measure.
After making sure that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, there is still a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers of savingslen
The Director-General of CECA rejected yesterday that another wave of mergers should be created by the savings and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When starting the merger process of Spanish savings, there were several institutions which ensured that this first phase would not take part and would wait for the second round.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director-General of the Spanish Confederation, said yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cijevica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that we will go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 constitutions, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the Director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executive Officials of the Aragon - Pozn. ozn. oklavarrieta) Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "with the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as it appears in the instalments, which have not now appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"Going from 45 investors with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus falling in line with the Basel Treaty," he underlined.
Olavarrieta admitted that "there are a number of very happy opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "the lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be on time before the end of the year".
The CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who question it have been sentenced to "lack of knowledge".
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and the savings and the system that managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking industry was very good at the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has laid down conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets has caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokering agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for unemployed people without benefits to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spainn airports and air traffic management - recast), the administrator of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticisms on the other hand at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address because of her responsibility for the opening of the current crisis.
How do we interpret this movement?
In advance, Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be like, which highlights the idea of observing the old traditions that are held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European opposition, in Germany, there are three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to March - although it can now appear as a Scythian, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
Thirdly, according to the German proposals, the processing of the euro with greater macro-economic surveillance, budgetary advantage, fines for guilty States, possible delays in payments for some of them, and the extension of the potential costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no space for spins now.
First, when in 2009 the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits, the German Government withdrew constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be correct (the plans for fiscal tightness and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, have practiced.
The second was shown by these Central European countries when Merkel painfully extended decisions on Greece's rescue.
It was already under strict criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last October days, Merkel again came forward with a clear opinion when it called for the reform of the European Union Conventions so as to allow the rescue of a Member State while at the same time requiring private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it speeded up the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved and we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany pointed to a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells all of us that, although it is now necessary to take measures that it seems to disagree too much with, this date will end with the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone in which States violating the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path towards growth by increasing savings and investment, reduced consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with enormous gaps in the balance of payments, which reigned in Spain's booming years, is simply not tolerable.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not only about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these circumstances, we might be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will alter greater tranquillity.
And take advantage of the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero has also understood this and his dual statements (a reform promised after meeting large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that through criticism to Merkel's address, the path of thinking needs to be put in order.
However, the red line that Germany set out is there, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And the possibilities that can be considered cannot be ruled out by leaving the euro area full of non-serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and Circumstances
The Fints that Alonso and Ramos showed in the fight with Ajax show no intention of avoiding punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the Battle of the Champions League against Ajax of November 23rd caused the sea of ink to be written about whether this is or is not non-sportive behaviour and whether UEFA should not eventually punish both football players.
As it is known, several minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the named players were deliberately losing time at a time when they were supposed to play foul to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in its leading group - and will be able to, remove the cards, continue to the next phase.
Finally, UEFA disciplined coach José Mourinh for two games, and the guilty players received a fine.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are not written but monitored.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team (who boasts in his anthem of grace and honor, who has already repented for similar actions by his players), and also, it seems, thanks to the drama of Mourinhem, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocater.
in any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, so whether or not there is a circulation of law in these performances; in fact, it is an action that respects the rules of sport which, of course, seems to be trying to bypass.
What kind of harm such an act does to a sports spirit solve.
One of the characteristics of sports behaviour is the physical inviolability of players who have not been violated in these cases, or there has not been a violent game.
Another of these features of a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over a team of opponents because of their misconduct - which has also not been achieved here.
Paradoxical to the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we do not normally characterize as lesions or circumvention has not occurred a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should have been as visible as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited, and they liked to get punished.
But the next question is, what will be the benefit of the perpetrators of their intentional wrongdoing?
It is necessary to state here that the opponent does not get into an disadvantaged position and that the current match does not achieve any benefit, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for another game, either, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards, which could endanger their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from the long-term perspective and with a degree of uncertainty, so at first sight the team can be eliminated, and besides that the players will be punished, and they will move to the second round of cards in which one card is less than the first one to be excluded.
So as the wheels go on, it won't be entirely clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sport spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that will allow for maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case of which we are dealing, players did not aim to avoid the imposition of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between suppository and circumvention is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly an act of celibacy.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusion and because of the way in which the transfer of instructions was made to provoke them from leadership.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Fight offer of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar diktat concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a quick celebration of workers themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, the arrival of December brings back pre-emptive parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but because of the crisis they have put up a fight to win customers by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, businesses and associations from this sector agree.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas was on Friday) the application for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for days in peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no operation.
As has been the case since 2008, when the thin years began, many companies have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees are paying for the loss of their own pocket parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand the price at the point of profitability, according to the president of the Gremi de Restaurantacio de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities does not at this time dare to predict what celebrations this month will be.
"People will think twice before making reservations."
"They want to go out, but as far as the subject of prices is concerned, they are cautious," he adds.
Business is going well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that thanks to the crisis customers tend to go down a degree and most customers want to spend about 25 euros now.
Research in various facilities shows that the biggest effort for booking requests is on the evening of December 17th.
Soteras Group reports a real boom reservation on this Friday, with the most requirements being to lose up to EUR 30, which has been adapted by the menu offered, the total prices of which are between EUR 25 and EUR 30.
in another important company, which is Andilana, which is 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought speciality to this year's calendar of more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible even to maintain prices from last year, and our menus, of which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they state.
In the group AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they recorded the increase in profits from the second half of the year and have a relatively solid outlook on Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, since they recorded, compared to last year, the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - ostrich).
They also noticed that there are already companies that are calling their employees again, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Vice-President Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurants and the Centre for Free Time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "resurrected", although clients "contract at maximum".
This impression, even during the Christmas celebrations, did not fail to show who is paying.
Pakistan's nuclear program engendered great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a "faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that is causing Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and significant details that they offer on the content of communications and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear safety is a place to increase, "is at a disadvantage", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored in pieces to ease their destruction in the event of an attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, alleged proliferation of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and a programme of controlled missiles is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as a growing reason to be alert.
"Pakistan had to hire a staff with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes of controlled missiles," said expert Jurij Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their counterparts from the United States.
The biggest new documentation published by Julian Assange's server is increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The dispatch issued by the embassy in May, which qualify communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected".
In another report Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "Through the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington that during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's chief of army, "very well explained" that "the Pakistani army must end with silent support to terrorist groups".
Hon to Chief WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday's "emergency call", the so-called red notice, to "localizing and monitoring the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse charges that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer assures the creator of Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
On November 20, when the International Police Council, based in French Lyon, issued this order at Sweden's request, did not publish it until yesterday when he received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary link and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation explained, however consider the so-called order of notice to be allowing the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police component - then, in particular, where States have a bilateral agreement on the issuing of detained persons, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
This step made it worse for Assengé's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday, declaring that the nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions through videoconference.
They also point out that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovič Berija, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother is defending the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, he is not silent.
On Monday, he provided an interview with Time magazine editor via Skype from an unknown site - in this interview, he asked the Foreign Minister of the United States for a demission of Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage in the UN and violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demission as "smirkful and absurd".
"I am not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual operating the website," he said to CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a highly-built officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The intention of President Barack Obama's spokesman to stop adding to Assang's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will have been chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations, "in order to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who financially contributed or otherwise provided them with assistance".
Further down came Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisor, who said Assange should be "killed", which he had subsequently called off.
"Obama should write a reward or use a drone or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever's in the government, whoever's responsible for leaking information has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too mild," Fox said
Puigcercós looking for peace in ERC by "swimming" on caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret for its stay.
Hugot proposes more plural executions and the end of the meeting system.
Apparently, Joan Puigcercós found a recipe to fight with the several hundred internal revolutions in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalánska - Pozn. rekkl.), without result due to the loss of 11 Members and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his gesture on demises seems to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Rovira is insufficient, and he also knows that the impact of this sector is already as weak as its leader himself today, and that he absolutely cannot do to him the kind of concern he had with other leaks.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to obtain new criticisms by means of eclipses that will help him turn to general elections.
First of all, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to make secret statements for his stay in office.
By using ballots, not by raising your hand.
They will be able to do so without fear of legal action if they wish to give the President a criminal vote.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the rift and submission of his own person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered confirmed by half and one additional, but added without specifying the percentage that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's followers demand more for the President than to give his office available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
However, given that they do not have enough majority to enforce demissions, they will try to enforce the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which will be put to the vote by the management to the National Council on 18 days of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise to move the Congress to autumn 2011.
ERC's leader stated that "many vote" would damage stability, and that his goal is to be able once and for all to wash his dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context, there seems to be a symbolic article that contemporary advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking Puigcercós' ideology into account, this innovation adviser took the matter to hand, that the leader would be confirmed by "exchange for several purposes".
And he appointed five of them, two of them.
The first is the "recommendation" of the execution to represent at least 90% of the members, which includes also new faces, which are from the sector favored by the Carod.
The second target could be big news.
Hugot proposes that the ERC should completely end the meetings as a mechanism of functioning.
He is therefore fighting for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegations selected by the vote.
The completion of the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two assemblies.
However, the 2008 Conciliation decided that meetings should be assessed at a special convention on the reform of the Statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has reflected the solution to this issue.
Now, without lying critical sectors, it could be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed for the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO newspaper.
There are cases of three women among the murders and a couple of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 deaths in Mexico, possibly associated with organised crime.
There are cases of dead bodies found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, further a blow from mercy to the head and had her hands and legs tied with a rope.
The next day a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the luggage compartment of a vehicle over the street of Mixtecas, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Soon on Thursday, 4 November, the body assistants discovered signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots in the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body, there was a report signed by the probably criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, an 80 - year - old man was murdered in Nezahualcóyotl after he left his home and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec district.
A man shot to the head was found dead in the El Naranjo colony on a remote road, and a .25 shell was found under the body.
Parts of the human body were found in the waste water channel in the Playa Golondrine colony in Ecatepec.
The rescue files did a thorough search for other parts of it, however, they did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported finding the body with their arms tied back and wrapped head on the spot of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in their laundry and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was also reported as a threat of death.
A day later, she was found in a colony of Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz, a cardboard box containing a human head.
In the nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found packed into the Zoquiapan cot in the Ixtapaluc district, and the next morning a man was found killed in Huixquilucan packed in a yellow-blue sheet, which was preliminarily identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report the killers left on his body.
A woman with no signs of life with two wounds to the back of her neck was found in the siege of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman was found tattoos of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - transfused).) and necklaces with its likeness.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later the bodies of two men were found with their head wrapped in tape and a message was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations in which it was: "This will happen to the unadapted."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec that carried marks after torture and had tied limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.
The first was cut and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the other was tortured and was found in a plastic package in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
They found agents and a message card with him.
China honours its objective of reducing greenhouse gases
The country's representative at the UN conference on climate change COP16 assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and stated that it insists on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN conference on climate change.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has invested $245 million in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into the following four elements: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
At all of these points, progress has already been made, including the adoption of the new Energy Act last year, which includes proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He further stressed that in China, the federal authorities cooperated with provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy efficiency, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, as he said, various multi-year plans have been completed or have been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, this is what he said about the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been introduced over the past five years and which has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, and a project to exchange lamps for saving bulbs and a project for mitigation and adaptation has been specified.
At the same table Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor for climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, the emissions of greenhouse gases per capita represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts with regard to energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National President of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - recast) said that the former President of the Party was entitled to request the National Law Commission of his right.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vazquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barientos was illegal and that the former President of this party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and claim his rights.
in an interview received prior to the objection by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagudem, he said that the exclusion of Espina was, in any case, a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Law Commission in Sonore."
"Mr Espino has the right to address himself in his case through a complaint to the National Council's Rules of Procedure in order to address the decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that it has never been at the negotiating table for the Alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would emerge from the internal elections held next December 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected, strengthened.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he stressed.
PAN President said that 71 years of dialogue was behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary we profit and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the Committee could elect the best president or president who PAN deserves for the next three years without a debate, so it would pass the Staff to the "who the Committee will appoint".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to any one of the five proudly hand over the office of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future clans, although "not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe, will be the flag and will be the subject of the country's observation, as "many expectations and complaints are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino is worthy of these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, resp. resp.) for his speech within four years, César Nava invited members of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the reign of Foxe and Claderón, then let them begin to defend them to get out of their shells," he testified.
He said that the head of federal executive power had the right to express himself in the manner he did during his speech in the National Auditorium, since he does not use grubik or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes Twitter law to support students without evidence
"If you think the approval of the Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," the American president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents, with a contribution to his personal social network account Twitter today.
"If you think the approval of the Dream Act law is right, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet link to a more comprehensive document that requests the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Because the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of the tax reductions from the Bush era and government funding was approved.
Such blocking, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect voting on the Dream Act law and other projects such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of Dream Act and other proposals, the Presidential Spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the House of Representatives, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "vote to conclude the debate" on the Dream Act law, so that the motion for legalisation of students without documents could be voted on in the Chamber from next Thursday, although it is more likely to be next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would be legalized by about 800,000 young people who had reached the United States before the end of 16 years, stayed in the country for the last five years and were admitted to higher education institutions or the army.
However, followers need to approve a proposal of 60 votes, which requires the assistance of several republicans, so that the organisations of their supporters are carrying out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats whose majority of Dream Act supports have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act need to obtain several republicans in case other Democrats decide to refuse the proposal.
Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida, George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but have announced that they will no longer support it next time.
Another republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives is attached to another version, according to most analysts Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserting the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la laga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is the equivalent of the Czech "hit the nail on the head - ozd. perkl.).
The second round of the cycle Pleasure from the Language was a promenade where participants performed the literary gala performance
"To this I understand with Sex in the language, but... Ring to the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to begin the second round of Pleasure from the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another trade fair dedicated to the topic of Sex in the Language, explained).
The finger "brings us into the narrow" wound brought the Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the round table, moderated Marisol Schultz and with Valenzuel's participation, Sergio Ramíreze, Mayry Monterová and Luis Garcia Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text dedicated to Gonzal Celori, which Schultz later described as a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist, who, when looking for knowledge, "the wound" goes from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not receive answers, although she does not have a trace of the same story.
The infectologist walks away convinced that "pity isn't my strong suit, maybe it'll be my wound."
After all, after a frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound is truly open and the scar is so symbolic".
The protagonist sighed slowly and concluded that "on the wound she managed to learn only so much that it is really open and does not exist", but she was convinced that pleasure and caution in the language must go hand in hand with her.
Writer Valenzuel played both.
Nicaragajec Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a delightful narrative, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with the elements of magical realism telling of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the honor that had been lost by a virgin, this narrative, which then turned around to speak to America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers, who had told him, were quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized overcrowding in the story of the extractive captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writer), mocked the finged testimony which was presented in stories as real, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such a painting that he lacked even a study."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have greater imagination" and precisely where the facts and lies are happening, where they no longer know what the story belongs to one group and, secondly, it reaches the fictional literature of its peak.
It really calls it a "cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter stressed and commended the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its word Ring to the wound enabled.
The Cuban-portoral writer showed with her finger the great wound of social violence that is going through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise that is not intended, of course," she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their 'chemical reaction'.
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also stressed "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and mind control, which reheats dogmatism, he forgets "that behind every touch there is a small no and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"In order to be the masters of our thoughts and reality, we need to color: and coloring means many times putting your finger in the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable, because he thinks in cartoons, black and fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harassing the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes to his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, suffered both good and bad during his career, but has already achieved on three occasions the decisive series.
In the Santos Laguna and Monterrey finals, in addition, two different styles are clashing with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, suffered both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he has left with the unrequited, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to be satisfied with the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner, and played the following final with the same team.
The Santist Strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had the burden of the Morelia Club, with which he fell total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he went back to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in the Tourneo Bicentenario 2010, again against "The Devils" from Toluka, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against "The Slayers" (the later nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - late.) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turn on 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse for the first time, even though he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm bound to, and the title would of course be for me, but it's the first one that's the most important," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in live memory has the previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have taught ourselves that until the referee writes the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned until the game is over, we cannot celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, he trusts his players: "You never try to get a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal times, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be prepared, in the last tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately our fate has prepared a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it has left us, and we hope that this time it will not happen."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and taste the glory that titles bring in for the first time.
United States changes visa rules
People will have to turn to the Centres of the Visitor Service before the interview at the Consular Department; costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shorter.
From 10 January 2011, the process of negotiating visas at the United States Embassy and consulates has changed.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Centres of the Visa Applicant (shortening from ASC English) before the interview at the Consular Department.
Staff from ASC will receive biometric information from the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total costs of the visa will be lower, no more payment will be required for the arrangement of the meeting, the second for processing the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for the tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for the visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to hold an interview with a consular official, but will only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and be fingerprinted.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview at the Consular Department will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra charge of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The American Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for alien life.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by an expert on astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference based in NASA, Washington.
When she invited reporters, NASA assured them that she would present "a discovery that would cause a break in the search for alien life", which sparked speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living under unholy conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who might present the possibility that one day they will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
According to the view, it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemistky National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and this ability increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another form of life that is different from what we know".
The Space Agency will announce the real extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explore Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period, when the opposition bloc was established in Congress, led by members of the PRD party (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Strana Democratic Revolution", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana of Work"), Convergence (Czechs "Conclusion" recast) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "Bipartism" to the House.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary term of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvedo Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "shremed" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it eliminates them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones voting against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - recast) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally creating a political marginality from PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institution Party") and PAN.
He stated that during the following days they would speak to representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subjected to the two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When I came here, I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even want to consider the views of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergence said that they were congruent with PRD, PT and Patron, which is why they will form a plurality group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolized, was now "dual".
Aspiration of the reform of the law is not that there be infinite bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five legislators, and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynso Esparza explained by PT that the Congress has now become a "beneficial" of two - in the reference to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was controlled by only one party, today it is divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected so that he could be given a seat at the table.
"In order that the five Members, who are likely to be nine, but now see us in five, are not left behind because of the curse agreements outside, each in another faction, we are united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have formed and agreed to, we stand outside, and we disagree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for "supplier"
The Mazatlán City Hall will pay a further check by the company's owner supplying the electrical material.
Another check for a little over 200,000 pesos was sent by the council to Lorena Guadalupe Camaché Palazuelos.
This sum paid in the second half of the company’s supply of electricity will rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the city transparency page, this last check, number 9258447, was sent on 16 November of this year, was exhibited on the circulation of 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was referred to as the "compensation of unpaid payments".
Treasuryman Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, who had been monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for sale at high prices, further charges.
What was not said is the total amount that the council still owes her, and how many checks will be sent for Camachová Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe to her, as well as to other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks appeared in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 days 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office in order to avoid the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the trustee has ensured that the services of the municipality's supplier have not been used again.
In the past, after July 25th, Noroeste published a review of checks issued by the councils to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city paid over 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in deep on the Sánchez Taboada talks, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places in bad shape and not to show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Business Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, the bad things the tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea of the markets they're avoiding, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these things for so long without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The worker will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not only to correct existing obstacles," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should do maintenance, because even as residents we deserve a clean place, the town hall should change its maintenance strategy."
There are other places that seem neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer - denunciation).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city that is clean with its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention was not paid here, and these facts highlight something which is well known, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be arranged in cooperation with the council, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but first it will be necessary to put them in order so that we can place them on the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results after Congress
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by being an example in finding a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges it faces.
The parliamentary period of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is being rejected in convulsions and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alliance, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and the last from PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from the new members of Congress, it is in order to be able to carry out good leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same foreign and domesticist Patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the road to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right without agreements between the parties, because they usually take steps to promote their own interests and become carnival guides to rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish a necessary switch that would move the ruling forward according to order.
"We want them to do decent work and be primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy, who gave them their votes in past confidence choices."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to gather all the strengths to achieve the economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth in order to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will help create jobs in a certain way".
Regarding tourism, he asked that new legislators give him greater weight in the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate in view of the fact that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which is also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to providing funds for starting tourism projects, Congress should help to provide security and help with the alcohol law, which has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
They're looking for the Three Kings.
Puppies, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the Coronadov Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the coming holiday of the Three Kings will be difficult to fulfill, since their household has exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose the hope that Kaspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in humble dwellings in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a steady job.
"There are times when it is difficult for us, because the husband is not lucky, but we sell Mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, the mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted clothes in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had a monster car', but I said to him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive,' remembers the sadness of Cayetana.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, a 10-year-old Isaiahs size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has a size of 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronadov Valenzuel family, you can participate in the "Seeing Three Kings" campaign, and at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
Ten surveys were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and faced with various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian hemp hordes, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaking police in Quebek.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, both suspected heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to arrive at the Sherbrook Courtyard following their arrest.
They could face accusations of Indian cannabis production, its possession with a view to trading with it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These surveys followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to join these arrests," M. Roel said.
This police operation took part in 70 police officers from the regional investigation department of Estrie State Police of Quebek, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Department of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The bill of conservatives who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants will clearly be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on Chart."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would allow any person from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chief of the Québec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong goal.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism that want her party not to be strong enough with regard to illegal immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take measures against transferers of illegal immigrants, and this is what we consider to be the bearer of another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the bill of conservatives because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," Mrs Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenny accused the opposition.
"The Canadians tell the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to the fly and treat it as some kind of patholisal."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, said Minister Kenny.
The government has not voted in favour of its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would demand a vote so that any member against would respond to his position before his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation commission for a particular issue.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil aims not to forget this idea: Québec intends to consult the New York Department of Investigation in January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday’s announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that during the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebek on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it is not necessary for a public safety critic, PQ Officer Stéphane Bergeron, to regard this notice as "a queen drawn from a hat" and "amateur solutions fumbled on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing during a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr. Charest maintains that he doesn't want to create this investigation commission, and people think, like you and I, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of the commission of inquiry is the demision of Jean Charesta", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Officials.
To be able to get out of this dead end, he proposed to Quebek to give special authority to the General Inspector to investigate the collapse and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also change the Penal Code after Ottawa, so that it can be better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be based on the authority for operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the caselaw of this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security Vic Toews confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments related to this file.
During Operation Jaro 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Penal Code had not yet been amended, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangstery Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have been under strict control due to severe precipitations that fell since Tuesday in several provinces.
There was a landslide in the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a precautionary manner.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy precipitation, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 more millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday night, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the valley of Outauais were hit the most.
It could fall to a total of 100 millimeters.
If we count these precipitations with the price of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may fear floods in some of the watercourses.
Quebek rescue service announced on Wednesday night a warning against the flood risk for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the las Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood preparedness and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, there have been severe disruptions of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte the result of heavy rains was cut off one commission bridge.
Two residents must have been evacuated in a preventive manner.
In Outaouais the spilling of some lakes from the shores caused some closures, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Rescue services are on alert and overseeing the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety adviser.
The Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued a warning center for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially embarrassed
The Quebec Radio Moderator, Stéphane Dupont, suffered a partial setback from the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Standards Council (RTTV), due to controversial statements concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as gross broadcasts during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Board considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccuracies of social assistance and inappropriate negative treatment of the Haitians of gross expression which did not correspond to the transmission of messages to the broadcaster during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting and Television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social aid to Quebek.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the transmission were inaccurate.
The moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the message transmitted was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most Commissions believe that controversial episodes of "Dupont's midday reports" have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no expense raised against him.
The last dispute involved a statement following an earthquake in Haiti.
So Stephen Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into a media shootout that caused a lot of reactions.
The moderator of the CHOI said he didn't send any gift to help the Haitians because we can't know for sure that the needed really get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already rescinded my orderly postponement of the thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any event, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast collaborated "over their responsibilities".
For the station, which, inter alia, will have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, there are minimal consequences.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special event.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), enters the kickbox and Thai box on the dads and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmel, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for games a little bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently this man, who works as a security officer and as an assistant to UPS, has just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23rd to 30th, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category kickbox full contact and the Thai box, I said."
"I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou right now."
"The rivals who finished the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I ended up in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, he added."
"It's interesting that in every competition, I've made some progress."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or the second time!"
"san show" or "sanda" is a discipline from China, where punches are fists and feet, as well as throwing them on the ground, allowed.
The matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
However Nacer Zimmal is to maintain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the super-turn of "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is China's highest and most prestigious, explains the sympathetic guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
He won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four competing in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg, 90 kg, 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category shall be laden so that one champion, king of kung fu, may be crowned."
450 million contracted without public competitions
Hydro-Quebec agreed on a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are just a consortium created with companies BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract for managing the entire project totalling $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie garerance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Quebec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie garance" won a lucrative contract without any public tendering.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causes price increases..
"It's a new way to realize the cycle and eliminate competition."
"This means that people who don't make side deals in secret are now making them open," PQ Member Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he said he was hard to carry, how public interest could be sold like this.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, strongly denying that it would be the case with this clause.
"I have my own way," she thundered and claimed that PQ was "unfair" and "was lacking accuracy".
She said that "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance limited in time to allow two or more companies to group their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complicated given the scope of the work.
The construction is already under way and must be distributed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebek, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the field of consulting in engineering is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly over the speed of the business register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of his main competitors; let's call CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are tens of them, leads to the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
Regarding the consortium of Énergie gérance, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of labour and that Hydro-Quebec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), explained which made us drop the forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few participants in the tendering competition, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you pick up the people who are in the contract as the contestants, and you say, "Let's go make a satisfactory deal with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competences of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Consort of the Énergie garerance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 that was received by the side of Quebek.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following Le Devoir's verification, he counted 109 consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, out of which Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in the "Énergie garerance".
All contracts were closed.
Together, they read $449,783,344, including a contract with the Énergie garance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good acquaintances of the Liberal Party Quebek".
Minister Normandeau has issued a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before she has specified that it is rather her management staff.
The responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not arouse trust
More green, but openly skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in the "unbiased" brands and environmental certificates, in order to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in the media universe, which insists on us and encourages a more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of reliable information, failure to fulfil obligations that it qualifies even as a brake for its commitment, Baromètre states the responsible consumption of which the first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption increased in 2010 by so-called socially responsible products, the people of Quebek, who are trying to sell them, do not trust them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say that they don't trust companies' promises about the environment, simply because green advertising companies is looking at a measuring tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also of the reliability of products and brands that are referred to as environmentally responsible, mention Barometers.
In the same way, the policy debate on this topic is accepted as a serious only 14.6% of the people of Quebek.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems to be a top priority for stimulating this page of consumption resuscitated at present by almost a third of the Quebec consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and a questionable nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre identified at a higher price for these products.
After all, a third of the people of Quebekus are building incredulously on the information provided about products or "green" services that we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred to buy from traders in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumer Québek likes to present himself as the king of recycling, which strives for the slightest impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained outside their vehicle, says Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of the people of Quebek said they were using public transport or recommending the use of the car to drive at least two people in order to protect nature.
The walk and cycle also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural research who used this cliche.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebek, which we have requested financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation but only to the amount of the loan.
The developer's company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy back the cinematic complex at Saint-Laurent's Boulevard, and which proved her mission as a film art lover, did not get what she wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebek proposes a loan that would be lower than it would be, there was some initial expectation that could lay the groundwork for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and requirements for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebek last spring, but applications have already been revised for reduction.
The proposal and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Only Parallèle et Angus have until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the State must be really rejected.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinematographic Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebek was opposed to direct investment by the state in order to be able to support the purchase of eXcentris, believing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a property project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinemas within ten years of the film art after financing the construction of the complex himself, which could have been the reason for the change by the state's financial board.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to obtain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his forehead, is running a campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that they will spend $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, one of three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th of next year and to perform the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Devoir, and so he ignores himself, he and his group are thinking about the suggestions for the reduction they have made to him.
Lifted tyre on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American springs known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but with that blow they express their sense of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when voting, and they believe President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
The four new reports, among which were the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, presented to the public yesterday, provide additional sensitive details to make each other "under the skin".
The communication with the date 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details at which point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides a few explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian Minority Complex, almost stuck, mentions maybe political leaders to talk about internal betting instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States are therefore," he concluded, "a literal elephant in these elections:all present but potentially too dangerous to speak of them".
The ambassador understands this "insulting silence" less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, parties or even better the head of the party to manage these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure that the government is preserved in voting on confidence at the beginning of February, regarding the federal budget, which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a $30 to 40 billion recovery plan," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone Parliament's pre-emptive session so that it could not be defeated by a coalition and that the opposition parties were referring to their survival as a quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, points out Washington's ever more negative picture, which cast dramatic shows on the CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too clever references to Maher Arar, No-Fly-List, or kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogation at the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánama.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, 15-year-old muslims of Canadian origin, state secret."
"The secretary accepted that she was reviewing the file."
Finally, let us note that the people concerned with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, reported on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
It went public and heard about it, including Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World Light Restoration Plan
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to restore domestic lighting, lighting trade and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the next limit to be achieved for the stability of the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the midst of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancún to compensate for the lack of difficult implementation commitments on the part of the industrialised countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the heated bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, light bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GEs emissions on the planet generated by light would be reversed.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from a car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow the decline of global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet will have to be deducted from another 5 Gt in order to achieve climate stability at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out that it will not be out of control.
In heated bulbs 95% of energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluorescent lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
The fluocompact bulbs will last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New bulbs with DEL, such as those introduced this week in the production of Philips - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a heated bulb, which gives us an idea of a possible savings with a compensation plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with reagents and radiate less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations to fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and should be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up a collection.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant, which releases many mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in heated bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres provide 25,000 tons of mercury per year for circulation.
The report also details the profits that any country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The Ivory Coast eagerly expects the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce its preliminary results, the UN President's spokesman stressed."
"Requests all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the declaration of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission had the latest date - Wednesday midnight - , without disclosing the results, three days after Sunday's scruples.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of CEI on television confirmed that the commission "continues to work" so that it could declare results.
On Wednesday, around the world, challenges have multiplied for CEI to finally declare the winner of the second round, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "subterrestrial" vote in the north run by former rebels of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Ivory Coast, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged supporters of the Ivory Coast from going to the polls.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took a look at Gbagbo's complaints.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, the very close political ally of President Gbagbo, controls it.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with the former insurgents, condemned the delay in the announcement of results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered a loss and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from sending results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned on the centre of the political faction of Ivory Coast that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on October 31st, winning 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassano Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France during the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, in the sense of the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%), including overseas areas), as shown by the provisional data on correction of seasonal deviations (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has settled at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
In a broader picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available for two weeks to work and whether they are looking for a job or not.
The situation of current young people on the labour market was still emerging with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
As for seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), which is 482,000 people over 50 years and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, according to the controversy about its method of calculation.
On Tuesday, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continued to produce monthly statistics and announced 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned.
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the head of waste treatment companies and the brother of the PS Administrative Board Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly falsely obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of abuse of company property, abuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment of fees, acceptance of fees for the purpose of influencing the office and holding the ammunition, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and insists that the judge explain to him all the questions he intends to ask him, not any delusions."
"It's easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, for AFP, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent a brief notice to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simone, his client never did anything but ensure the operation of the puzzles he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Mr Simon said.
On this issue, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Augagne agglomeration services, was accused on Wednesday of misappropriation of public funds and set-up, and left at large, under judicial supervision, the ban on meeting, protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that have been revealed to him."
"The examiner looks at it and leaves it free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnux.
Another four persons were charged and released on Tuesday night on Wednesday, under the supervision of two of them, said state attorney Michel Rafhin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for the acceptance of charges to influence the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are accused of one for "the theft and abuse of the property of society", the other for "the complosure of the misuse of public funds".
Finally, business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "depriving the abuse of company property".
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement concerning Corsika.
Investigators suspect his companies were helping to launder money from a large gang.
The investigation is conducted in a number of open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search is focused in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the Martian community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: The Elysian Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spying", united the opinions in France, brought diplomacy into combat alert and highlighted the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this was closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them how to handle such cases by hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the leaders of France tried to convince Washington that the release of young French women was no compensation against the release of Majid Kakosand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by American justice for the clandestine trade in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they submit to the acute light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram, written in Paris on 12 August 2009, has the title "Iran:French comments on how to deal with the hostages".
Council of the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of the U.S. Diplomacy Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do as much for being transported back to the country by their own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Share noise," they say, "always express strongly "in the media the words "the fundamental rights of man", "the innocence", "the immediate liberation".
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be brought into trouble.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "it won't solve anything", the Iranians are "mistresses of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the liberation of Clotilda Reiss (which occurs on 16 August, on the day that the French Embassy provides it with refuge) "will require payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (EUR 230 000).
And they're going to announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will "focus itself".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest more than 1,800 French people living in Iran", he said.
August 28, 2009
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakosand, of whom the United States declares that he has been expelled for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released to Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
As well as many observers, the US Embassy is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to obtain material intended for a nuclear programme, the deployment of Majid Khakavanda is a bad report.
Did France enter into a contract?
Release the Iranian for the liberation of young French?
In his next interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, he said, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to confront it.
"Conversations were held between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakosand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Councilor of the Elysian Palace dials a telephone number, hangs a telephone headphone, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is currently in buildings managed by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss prison in Iran, the Elysian Palace is working on efforts, negotiating, through communications and organized "excesses" to the media to convince the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play the "significant" and "influence" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and find that manipulation brings its fruit, because several articles in print reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 is evolutionary of the media "blast" of the French officials.
What is the basis for such a measure of "gratitude", expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Through their statements, full of praiseworthy French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a weighty idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "goes towards the validation of President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "overplaying the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria, what praisers can do when playing a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to "sow the grain of the quarrel between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richier confided to him: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But yet we thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
The Communication thanks the presidents Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of our country's liberation".
End on-line games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "The Pecival", which will prohibit adolescents from playing online after midnight by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials have indicated.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning problems at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, head of the Ministry, who is in charge of the bill.
Online games will be new available since 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it to be completed by the responsible worker.
It also gives people who ask for it free programs, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most affected countries and daily printing brings regularly various facts related to the intensive use of the internet.
At the same time, the country is an undeniable master in online games world competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals on World Cyber Games, face 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicion of corruption is set up by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday by the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a choice of highly politically motivated, where fighting for influence and lobbying risks overcoming technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the royal competition of Fifa in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will succeed in acquiring a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be established in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons participating in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, Head of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting worldwide.
Negotiating behind the scenes faces the risk that they will last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fif's assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not weigh too much for the 22 executive board members in an hour to vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to the suspension of two CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradles of dignitaries, which so far hosted the world championship only once in a year.
The BBC put a crown on Monday when it sent out a document that "tipped on the pin" three influential CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring the English leader with David Cameron into trouble in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move that his predecessors performed in the role of Tony Blair, who was able to win for London the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to allow England to add a new gloss to its CE name (European Commission?)?
There is nothing less certain, because the couple of Spain-Portugal do not miss the tromphies of already prepared stadiums, his welcome (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any remedies against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared "some competition in the preparation of the vote" in the verbal indications, which were only limited to accusing the English press of the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its significant experience in 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fif, seems to have a big head start ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately produced a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for both countries, which together in 2002 passed the "test".
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Championship to China, which Fifa passionately wishes, made the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Katar, who pulled the big ace from his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new lands, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the small fee of TV (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, creating a momentum for Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace is calling someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the involvement in the secret associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persisted.
In both ways.
In 2006, without believing it, the friends of Jacques Chiraca claimed that the third term should not be ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression of Nicolas Sarkozy, he assured that "sometimes he will decide in the autumn of 2011".
As the MP members recalled on Wednesday evening at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" had little fever.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from that.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notification.
It's not the first time he's reminded of such meetings by the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he passed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about another stage."
His earlier statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Speeding up the path to candidate for PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèna Royala's cradle that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, this is because its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want organisation to be more early than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, voters would prefer the candidature of Françoise Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we do not discuss the issue with the UMP ", they reacted promptly and cautiously to the people from the nearest neighborhood of the Prime Minister.
"If they believe possible defeats, they will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with obviousness.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue its state title purchases.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in the year should be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the withdrawal from the crisis or, at least, a notification of the cessation of the large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of Europe's sovereign debt pledges, the Institute for the Issue of Securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today, so tense in European securities markets.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the Central European Bank in order to address the debt crisis of the European States.
She didn't want to say that she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their programme of purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I share my consideration for my European partners...."
In the evening before that, in Brussels, in his interview with the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in terms of his intentions, and agreed that he had stated that the programme for the purchase of state titles in the secondary market was "continues" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
Only assurance: The Central European Bank will keep its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from a treasury made by the Central European Bank has doubled to nearly EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And because of the market misunderstanding, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks purchased EUR 67 billion from May 2010.
There is no doubt between market agreements regarding the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no major change in course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, the last designated bank shall approach the unlimited provision of liquidity under large terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Today, economists expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of a short-term new voltage," says Michael Schubert, an economist named Commerzbank.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", preceded by Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank must maintain the volume of purchase of its bonds in order to revive the faint market", Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the European banks' exposure to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain their presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors on the market at any cost and to act in such a way as to prevent the start of the paid performance of States belonging to the most fragile," a prominent bond administrator testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, the nations will be more concerned about reducing their debt rather than stabilising it.
It's the saving of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi backs its back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the worrying situation eased somewhat, yesterday with the reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary tranquillity.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economics of the Presidential Regions, they said they heard Giulia Tremonti qualified as "indeterminate" and that he was expecting a "unforeseen" weekend, which he then demented.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rate reached 210 basis points and the price of covered contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some disturbance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said of himself that he is "too busy" with the "indignant development of markets" and a possible disease originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Of course and without encryption, its problem is the absence of growth and inextricable fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the deficit of public finances will represent an additional 4.3% gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% assumed by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From here the novelty of the new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The foundation stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the Board of International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor a short or long-term, because, despite its significant debt (119.2%) of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main economist of the OCDE.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the proposal to express distrust of the House of Representatives, and thereafter the elections with which it is counted at the end of March could be organised.
A period would thus begin, hardly appropriate for a decision to be taken in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated this on Sundays all day and night, obviously, they are very committed to defending their currency and currency."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest on European state bonds, has brought water to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation Office announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, based in particular on banking systems," says Economist Exane BNP Paribas.
What's more, "political time runs slower than market time."
Knowing this interrupted context and the danger it poses, the European countries are intensifying the debate aimed at strengthening the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and Ecofin since the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is today.
It is the fate of non-conventional measures in support of the euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, blocked a trip across Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of this path is not to increase funds, it is indeed preparing the ground to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilised by additional direct engagement at the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are a different route from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, seeking international assistance even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain their confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the normalisation of markets with sovereign bonds.
On its trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of not having enough 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to re-supply on the stock of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first business plan with European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "more than" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The Fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised by EUR 60 billion to that day.
A council that has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and precipitation: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations still cause difficulties in transport, especially on the roads of second classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts have since now an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and precipitation.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres a la Vienna, joined 20 districts that already have an orange alert, 18 from midday and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snow rushes cause problems in the north of La Gironde and the forest Charentes and snows on Ile-de-France.
Snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm, seats from 7 to 10 cm, are expected in the areas concerned and blankets from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The areas of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the areas of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow rushes are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activity, Méteo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have prohibited the passage of heavy cargo transport - to trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and the police recommend going out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of certain trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
No specific measures are envisaged for the reduction of freight traffic on Wednesday night.
The district office "calls all drivers of cars to the utmost care on the roads and to adapt the nature of the carriage".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to expected snow rushes.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services be contacted by their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France in full stream, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
We're recalling in particular 23 billion on the Grand Paris Metro to build Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be launched, the State notified a grant of EUR 4 billion.
This is in theory the amount which will then allow SGP to use part of its dual-source financing for contracts.
We're finally getting to the first additions today.
The 2010 financial rectification law, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to ensure such funds.
There are two: the creation of special taxes from equipment and the increase of taxes from offices in Ile-de-France.
First, let us read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The revenue from this interest is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices that already exist, "to be modernised in order to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Preluded.
It's not numbered in the text.
We're 4 billion away.
"It is stated that these fiscal resources are joining 4 billion euros of the capital grant, which will be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in explanation of the reasons.
We in SGP don't find this system shocking.
"Since we've created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover our studies for three years and then grab up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will not be added to the 2014 budget until 2013.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promises are still held by absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat disturbing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeance hackers and resourceful scouts
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be only a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level and predominates the future of controlled regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that each document drawn up by a secret service (any nation) consists solely of press cuts.
The "emergency discovery" of Americans about Berlusconi's way of sexual life tell them what everyone could read in any newspaper for months (all except the two Berlusconi owns), and the faint caricature profile of Kadafí has long been for cabaret artists with a theme for sketches.
The rule according to which secret documents can only be drawn from reports already known is essential in the dynamics of classified services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work is repeated (about Graal, Rennes-le-Château puzzle, Templars or Zednaři) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (and does not know where to look for news of the non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) head of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be editor of the Libération newspaper) who considers only what he confesses to be true.
Information with high secrecy about Berlusconi, which the American embassy sent to the State Department, was the same newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, was there so much fuss over the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, and even though embassy, from the end of World War II at least, and from the time when the heads of state can call or fly off to a common dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, have been transformed into a spy center.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation knows very well that only out of hypocrisy seems to ignore it.
However, the fact that it repeats itself in public, disgraceful duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most classified information from the most powerful country in the world is a hard hit, not an insignificant one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their performers.
But let's go from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to grasp all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his own people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since the possibility of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction, hotel visited, used highway and so on, became a citizen of the total victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it works now, that even the tombs with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message is no longer one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the vigilante of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep his own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an immeasurable secret (and the immeasurable mystery will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is truly a secret without purpose, because it is drawn from public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were meaningless secrets means to deprive him of all power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something great to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of the enriched power so significant?
It is obvious that in the future the states will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a poster embossed on the corner of the street.
But it is also absolutely clear that with current technologies, it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep a secret message on the phone.
There is nothing easier than finding out whether and when the head of state has travelled by plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How can they be kept secret in the future ?
I know it's a science-fiction forecast for the moment, and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who are transporting discreetly the performance of formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that know the memory or rather hide rare information in the heel of their shoes.
Information will be kept in unique copies in keyholes: overall, the attempt to spy in Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to film one step at a time, move it forward and backwards, and discover all the secrets of the installation, while now CDs (numerical) allow only to jump on chapters, that is, after macroports.
Through the speedboats we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the journey by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication techniques will return to vehicles carried by horses.
Last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was established in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now it's an embassy that demands confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to honour promises for quickly unblocked funding (proclaimed fast start funding (fast start) or early start) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were discovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (this is EUR 420 million per year).
At the beginning of COP16 the EU raised a large ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report specifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, distribution of booklets...
Clear operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 it released 2.2 billion euros, leading it to the right path to honouring its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are, under the Copenhagen Agreement, 'new and additional' to ensure that the increased burden is realized without prejudice to the public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there's no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered the 2009 reference: international funding was maintained and it added 150 million to it for three years the title of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide publications au development.
In particular, France's overall aid to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even be reduced) to comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional" ...
Another decisive element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculation.
Some, such as France, think that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Obviously, it is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions, which consist of more efficient technologies), it is benevolent to present one euro that we get, as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for a creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only provide this reason: it "observes" its commitment of 420m euros, it makes 91.5% of the loan (389.8m euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1m euros) - see the EU document for you to verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to that extent.
Germany has requested 46% from here, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (between others) are complying with their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to make their promise, France only gives 10 centimums and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful piece of glass!
To sum up, in its funding, "fast start" France operates with a double sequestration: on the one hand with the development of the share over time and on the other with real financial burden.
Although it only spends 36.1 million euros, it can convince that it spends 420 million euros "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (since it seems that while it is Bercy who has made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is sufficient to lend?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in an enormous machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever this is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early financing.
First, France should announce the change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and integrity and justice to other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent discussions on long-term funding deposits (other major chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "addictivity" or the way in which loans are charged.
France should change its attitude to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So all hope is put in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscius-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of the fast start of France and its vision of "additiveness" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international trust necessary for further discussion.
An alarm about pesticides that children will grow up to be.
A 10-year-old child will be late one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which notes that its results "are not significant statistical value given the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the problem being processed", she bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a snack for a child about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as sugars, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is debilitating: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic, possible or probable substances, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal mixing glands (PEs), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research we well see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagious," the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about ten residies with possible carcinogenic effects and three shown as certain carcinogenics, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, listed as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicidal agent in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunches where studies have revealed traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, buttered beef steaks, tuna in the tin, and even goose and gum were spilt with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap analysis, the presence of nitrates and chloroforms was revealed.
Steak from salmon to dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues, and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminants cocktail" is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) community has proposed a "creature in the face of an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereal.
