Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, even Škoda
Defender Filip Novák helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vicemaster.
His team won 2:1 on the field of Kayserispore and held the third Besiktas.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave after the January crossing from Slavia the tenth goal for Rizespor, which he saved, even though he fell 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed to the defense the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In 63 minutes the goalie Kayseryspore just fired a sharp shot and the Czech football player fired the ball into the net.
The household managed to settle for five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute set set set to bring the victory to his side, when the break four to one was successfully completed.
The damage in the opening of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce settled after salt at 1:1.
Although he did not hold back for a long time, Rizespor did not have to, because the results of the rivals left three points above the descent strip.
The competition will end the Sunday duel of Basaksehir in the Kasimpasy field.
The well-secret cave in the New Bor Desert wasn't actually inhabited.
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, near Nova Boru in Czechoslovakia, in the forests led by the Counting Road, there are several sandy rock formations.
Natural and artificial.
And we're going after the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave of the Desert.
In fact, there has never been a hermit alive and a cave served as a hiding place, a more precise secret chamber, apparently for grain.
The cave is cut from side to side into a rocky vault and accessible on the stairs above.
But until the last moment, it is virtually invisible.
It will be delivered up to narrow stairs leading to some rock gallery, from where it only enters the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far from human habitation, at the time of creation it could have been on the top platform where the forest is today, the field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window or a traditional place located at the melting point clearly shows that there could never survive winter here," explains historian Kamil Podruuzek of the Faculty of Philosophy of John Evangelist Purkin in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench in the back which apparently serves to put the container down.
"I see it as a chamber to save some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podruużek.
There are signs of instruments on the cave walls.
The breaking out of the sand was simple and quick for the consecrated.
It was enough to use the match properly and to break the sand gradually.
According to the length of the lead on the tip and the method of cutting, a period of cave formation can be defined in a framework.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes a sleepover in today’s times.
If you approach the cave above one of the forest roads and take you under the cave running trail and the nearby county path, you will surely find a path down too.
And by the way out of the woods, maybe you'll still be caught by near the Raven Rocks.
Jokokay Minarík is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Phillip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is equipped for similar cases, and we have a family in Hanover luck.
This greatly facilitates the situation and also takes care of the daughter of Finland," said the server Jezci.cz of Minarík's wife Katja.
"Everyone's doing the most, now Philip needs time for reconstruction.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered a problem of head and patient trauma in their sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
To support the wounded Minarík he called on Twitter as well as star Frankie Dettori, who won in Ascot on Saturday the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, thus balancing the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been selected on the Gofundme server to date.
The target is EUR 100,000 (2.6 million).
Video referee took Sassuola football players four goals, lost 0:2
The Sassuola footballers, although four times in the Saturday match in Naples, eventually had to accept defeat 0-2.
Not one of their goals was recognized by the referee after consulting the video.
According to the Italian media, it's a record failure of technology, so many hits have never been denied by VAR to one team.
"Var was stricter on Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no other team.
New technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"The Sassuola unrecognizable goals festival.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead in eight minutes on Saturday, but after half an hour of playing, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
Philip Djurič's goal, however, was not recognized after the hit of the judge's video for the osad.
For the same reason, Djurič’s next hit and hit by Francesca Caput and Domenica Berardi were not paid.
On the contrary, they added another goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, it was the most charged in history.
"The growth has attracted as much as 30 per cent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-auts," said CEZ Chief of the Department of Clean Technology Tomáš Chmelík.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, the Tesla electric car manufacturer, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets.
The company MOL represents the operators of the classic pumping stations.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electricity network only last year," Jan Jusková, spokeswoman, explained.
However, the editorship of Denik exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows from them that drivers from the stations withdrew on average 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we pass small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average charge of two and a half hours.
The rough majority of the refueling then took place in free tariff.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is being pulled primarily in the capital.
The territory of Prague is situated in all five of the most difficult charges of ČEZ, which will be covered by its popularity by the whole city of the region.
Among the regions then lead Olomouc.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is the remote station on the border, for example in Bohumín or in Prachatice, which often remain unutilized throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-auts arrived.
In the extensive survey of the daily Czechs in motion, eight percent of readers reported that the purchase of an electric car into the family was being considered.
Only a third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Ecological activists protested in Prague
According to organisers, the government's current steps in the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more diverse approach.
Actions called The Last Drop were attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Greenpeace Party of Greens, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who stand out long-term against the expansion of the lower Turks, there are people who stand out against the extraction of the scorpion at the U.K. Ostroh, there are people who stand out against the construction of meaningless dams," said Marik Wolfová.
It stated that the main requirements of the protestors are the establishment of a plan for the retention of water in the countryside, a dramatic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to support sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend people's interests, not reckless and destructive businesses," she said.
A petition stand called for representatives of the Czech State was placed on the Malostrán Square in order to lay down greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape.
The present people were equipped with banners with passwords such as "The End of the Rape Depke" or "Minimum Coal, More Bars".
From South Moravia to Prague came Jan Škoda from the Company For water for people who protest against the plan of extraction of scorpion in Hodonínsk.
"The drinking water source threatens 140,000 people," he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most valuable source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel harvest is only 500 metres from the wells, and according to estimates it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
As a so-called agro-ecological farmer, Vojtěch Veselý came from Valek village to Karlovarsk.
He drew attention to the logbooks of small farms, which are not used for incomes and profits and supply the inhabitants directly to the site.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, while not causing such damage in the form of rural and environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash to a house in Germany
When an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment house in West Germany today, three people died and two others were injured.
This was reported by local rescue personnel, according to which there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house between the dead.
Letoun crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The subterranean apartment, which was one of the five units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Local Fire Commander Robert Mayboom said that two crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote that it was the mother of a self-consumer whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from an apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency strike was found near the accident, which apparently served as a stop to landing.
The police are based on the fact that it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine launched from an airport near Marl.
Diary Rheinische Post, appealing to the eyewitnesses, said that before the crash, the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed into the air prior to the impact on the ground.
The Czech savings office mistakenly charged some payments with cards twice on Saturday.
Already removed the bug
Czech savings to its clients on Saturday afternoon mistakenly charged some payments with cards twice.
According to the spokesman of the bank, Lukáš Kropik, the problem could have been thousands of transactions.
She's already taken the money out of the bank, and she's got the money back to the clients.
The problems with the double billing of card payments were recorded on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (s Saturday) we updated the system at night, and all these double payments were returned immediately to the clients.
At this moment everything works without problems," Kopik said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice, the spokesman does not know, according to his estimate it was less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the savings problem are investigated.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," said Kropik.
Czech savings facility is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner of the partnership is the Austrian group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojts on Monday will present a three-degree emergency system against coronavir
"As a result of the power of community proliferation at the regional level, they will be stupendous.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in the ČT.
It will be a so-called semofor, each region will be marked with green, orange or red colour according to the risk of coronavir.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only Moravskoslezsky region would currently have an orange color and that it would be close to Prague.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Guide and Karolinka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolínka are staring at each other, it's not easy at all.
Jonah's love is hindered by his father, the stainless waterman Hastrbuch, and Karolínka has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not human.
Unfortunately there is a young man named Libor who will do his best to protect the whole village, and especially Caroline, from the water pox.
What if he intrigues and lies?
Especially if she can throw down Karolínka Jonah and give him the advantage, the worthy Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone who can drown in midnight Konvika, spoiled flour, mill fire, and other lotteries.
The indignant villagers will set up a water chase, and Jonah’s head will be covered with an incorruptible water curse.
And now Konvičko's soul, Caroline, do it!
How do you soften old Hastrich, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and in exteriors at the pond of Brzin, in Obděnice, Sedlčansko and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Mostecký Motorway launches new e-shop
Customers of the bridge road can use the new e-shop on its website.
It will also buy coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person for a road worker in the starting tower.
"We have come to improve the e-shop so that it is user friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be obtained through it.
At the same time, on this occasion, we prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1,000 crowns for all courses of safe driving from our offer.
The coupon will be found on www.autodrom-most.cz", explained the business and marketing director of AUTOM MOST Jana Svobodová.
The e-shop website is now transparent, according to her, the customer is easily oriented.
"The visitor of the e-shop chooses the target on the list.

When paying for a selected product or service, the customer may choose one of four options.
Payment of advance (bank transfer), receipt, cash in personal collection or online via payment gate.
The disease rate is generally mild, the hospital must have only three percent infected.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of coronavir, or the summer dose of sun has greatly improved our immunity.
The infectious department of hospitals is half-empty, even though the numbers that are infected are growing.
"This situation today and April is completely different and it is given primarily to the number of hospitalised people," Health Minister Adam Vojciech confirmed.
It is worth remembering that on April 11th, when the first wave of epidemic broke out, all the rugs were worn, the army was carried out, the republic was closed, and the Czechs were using disinfection for a year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with a covid-19 die at most two people.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava because of fires in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 infected are already - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another seniors' home closed down a hygiene clinic in Černožice on Královéhradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests in one of the nurses.
"We are searching, we have limited movement, we have all the hygiene measures," said the director of the pensioner's home, Martin Schaniel.
According to him, none of the home clients have any symptoms yet.
The bold tests will start with hygiene tomorrow, and then they will decide on the next measure.
Hospitals respond to an increase in the number of infected.
The Oncology Institute in Brno launched today an automatic camera system at the entrance that will see if people have a mask on their way in.
The record reports the South Bohemian Hygiene, who recorded 25 cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachative Company.
A total of 131 infected arrived on Saturday - that is, half of the Friday count - but less is tested on weekends.
A debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson trashed
A big surprise tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh also performed in a fight with the player, which the second most prestigious company in the PDC won in 2018.
The beginning of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-chip leg, and he's been on top of it ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent, and a much more experienced "Flying Scot" was just hard to get to the doves.
The way that the Dream Maker had it in his hand also testifies to the fact that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, a young Belgian man managed great high-level checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, in an unfavourable state, but "he caught a big fish" and shut down 170.
At the end of the game, there was great frustration on Anderson.
The spikes were more of a throwaway, and his triumph was a walking rival who was doing absolutely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh changed the first of three match darts and was getting his name - he wrote his big dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian shooter that it is his first winning major.
It is still true that Karel Sedláček is the last player to defeat van den Bergha.
There was a charge at Nantes for the cathedral's fire, a man confessed.
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century windshield windows and destroyed the organ.
The investigators verified the suspicion of arson because the fire followed the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no sign of anyone getting violent into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 29-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without starting a prosecution.
Now the D.A. has reported that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested on Saturday again, confessed and faced arson charges.
In case he's found guilty, he's facing up to ten years in prison and a fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: Monday we present "Semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play a role in the pandemic plan for which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"They will stoop according to the power of community proliferation," the minister explained.
He added that, for example, Moravskoslezský kraj or Praha would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in each region differs significantly, he added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (UZZIS).
Specific measures will be taken, according to the Minister, whether it is the duty to wear towels or to organise special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation worsens to establish an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie programme.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that there is no major non-compliance with the emergency announcement or the re-calling of the emergency staff.
In view of the increasing number of infections since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear towels on internal events of over 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced to 500 people, now 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear in the last moment what measures were taken and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, was met with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should create a sense of certainty and counterbalance the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Questions.
The measures may already vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear blankets and non-resident medical devices, such as in pharmacy or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear gloves when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in Liberec and Ustek region.
It is necessary to wear towels in the internal public spaces, in the Ministry of Health and in medical facilities from 14 July in the Highlands of Jihlava.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in Moravskoslez region, as in the Central Bohemian region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government has also approved a so-called Europe-wide traffic light, which colourfully distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries, and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities do not require a negative test on or a quarantine against coronavirus for Czech citizens from 15 June.
These are mandatory upon the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are in the low-risk category of disease.
The technoparty in Benešovsk is continuing.
Plays for a third capacity, finishes at noon
Head Lhota (Benesov) Technoparty at Hlaváčky Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday night.
Still playing a third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the police's estimates at 8:00 p.m., there were about 500 people left, the original gross estimates were three hundred, the morning was 900, said police spokesman Lucie Nováková.
Initially, the technopartes were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, and at that time actually part of the music systems fell silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still in part.
We expect that music systems will gradually be disconnected and dismantled," Novaková said.
"Policemen continue to monitor departing visitors consistently in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before leaving," she added.
Dozens of law enforcement officers are overseeing the event, foreign police, transport and law enforcement police are on site, and there are also swearers with service dogs on standby.
"In the course of today, the police checked 470 persons moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six were sitting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novaková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for stun and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The officers also dealt with 14 offences in transport.
At the request of participants, the technopartists conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests on the presence of stunning and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants were not reduced, the police would be affected.
On the TV show Prima Partie was told by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor did the health station or the Ministry of Health request it.
On Sunday, Czech TV (CTV) said that the technoparty was also extended to surrounding land, whose owners disagreed with the use of for technopartes.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
The supporters of the techne on the meadow at Hlaváčky Lhota arrived on Friday night.
The police were originally guarding a meadow in Blažimi, Benešovsk, where the technoparty was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčka Lhota, where the technicians actually moved.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažima.
Snake sting: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year has been recorded in Iron City.
She got into the leg of the girl, the 2010 anniversary, which the parents had brought to the emergency service base there," said Dnieku, Regional Health Service spokesman Mária Svobodová, saying that the child was then transferred to the hospital in Klatov.
Snakes are the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Shumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a snake aren't too high, they're afraid of themselves when they're in regular contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away for a loud sob.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example when you accidentally step on it.
Its sting, however, is not a tragedy, although its poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is primarily for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person often feels sick, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea after being stifled, in the case of weakened individuals and in particular allergic people, there may be anaphylaxis shock," she described for Denic Miriam Gredova of Klatovo Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the baby out of the window.
After the policeman he poured wine and threw dishes
After 11:00, the unit entered the apartment and the man was detained.
The pregnant women immediately took care of the medics, spokeswoman Markéta Janovská in a press report.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, after a police negotiation he threw dishes, knives, or poured wine from the window.
He strengthened his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
On one occasion, he even climbed into the windows where he scurryed.
The police are still investigating a man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
A stosur prefers a daughter before tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosurová hasn't touched an affected season since this year.
The 16-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, doesn't want to end her career.
Next year, he plans to return to the courts and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, tennis will enjoy more than ever.
Stosur announced two weeks ago on social networks that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter of Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'll stay home, spend time with my family, I'll be with all the little milestones that our Evie will live through in the next six months and I'll just enjoy it," the former world leader said in four games on the Australian Union website.
WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on August 3rd with an Anticuk tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie discovers meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1,320 pieces of poaching eggs of unknown origin, in addition in inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the mission company," the State Veterinary Administration stated.
In the control of the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller had no proof of the origin of the goods and was not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, with almost half a tonne of unmarked food without proof of origin.
Most were unable to determine the date of consumption, some of the products had a duration and were corrupt.
At five kilograms of septic acid, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
In May last year, vets with officers in the 80 kg food market area were detained without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, with part of them moldy.
Putin telephoned with Zelenska before the start of the truce in Donbas, the Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he is to start paying for a new truce from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin's statement, criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
In a new order of arms, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on Wednesday evening with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The truce is due to begin at midnight on Monday night, to be "complete and general" and to open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin told Zelenski that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organise the local elections contradicts the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens prospects for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the planned elections to local representatives would not take place on the territory of the pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control over the borders of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after providing these regions with broad autonomy and organising local elections.
According to the Union agency, the Green Office stated that both states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming armistice in Donbas and on the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region, such as the demining of areas of fighting or the withdrawal of part of the front.
Zelenski also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional shootings and artillery attacks on both sides of the front.
Since spring 2014, the conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead.
Ukraine and the West blame Russia for the military support of separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenski made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master of the 10th fight is Rykl, 7th battle ruled by Novotná
The defender of the last two titles of Doleželj did not finish the Saturday program of the four hundredth grade, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
For ten years, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the coach group Josef Karas, has retired after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the foreign MCR so far, this time he was the only ten-theater who got across the seven-thousand border.
Another medal was won for him by Vilém Strasky and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, the Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's too bad there weren't guys here and Cope didn't start because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes so good, I appreciate the fact that I put a 30-centimeter persona in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the club and most disappointed about the disc, there I was medium," he admitted on the union facebook.
On the first day of the seven, Kateřina Cachová won more than a hundred points, even though she was hit by an injured ankle on a reflection leg.
In the remote sector, however, it recorded only 570 cm, with a splinter that did not drop 40 meters and no longer entered the final eight-point.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Kateřina Dvořáková.
She first came out of the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I so wished it were around the 630.
Yesterday, I began pulling the calf, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotny said on the union facebook.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
The well-known alternative fuel is LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) which is a well-known alternative gas in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or oil, given significantly lower consumption taxes, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per km.
Like gasoline and oil, it has its environmentally friendly variant of "bio LPG".
But it is all new - the European market first appeared last year and the Czech press report of the Czech Association of LPG arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in conjunction with the classic fossil LPG," says Jiří Karlík of Primagas Association.
However, an LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, the chemical side is consistent with the classic petroleum LPG, which is now refueling a number of motorists in its cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the method of production," says bioLPG Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association.
This is also said to be one of the great advantages of the LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and distribution infrastructure is quite good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently produced as a by-product in the manufacture of bioethanol from food residues and cane sugar.
In the future, it should also be targeted, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, conventional petroleum LPG is formed partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the production of natural gas.
Therefore, depending on the production technology and sources, the operation of the car on the bio LPG is more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation of the petroleum LPG and up to 90% in comparison with oil.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Pure Mobility (NAP CMM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates by the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles ride the LPG; the Ministry of the Environment states in the NAP ČM a slightly higher number, approximately 200,000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, nearly 6,000 car replacements were carried out last year alone.
To refuel LPG in the Czech Republic is possible at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the number of diseases infected with the Coronavir virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon's number dropped from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"According to the surge in the number of people cured is the revision of data that has not recently been pursued by health care providers to update," said health statistics chief Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered, and 371 Covid-19 had unfortunately fallen.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Choice.
A politician and a sociologist were looking for variants for the pandemic
A change of law is required in October's regional and Senate elections to allow people to vote in quarantine because of the coronavir, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He reported it on Sunday at the Prima Television Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that the provisions of the law would need to be adapted, under which people in quarantine cannot vote for health reasons.
For example, the ban on elections should be maintained for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to foreign experience, it would be more likely to record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as being overrated.
Personally, then, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary ad hoc to come up with mechanisms (volve) that could be implemented this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main thing, then, is to be prepared for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (both in foreign or Czech countries) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As others, they see the electoral units mentioned above or, perhaps, the possibility of voting in the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavir - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries have been postponed this year because of the spread of coronary disease.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears throw demonstrators at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the 'mafian style of government' that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning a national blockade Wednesday, according to the DPA.
Today's protest, which took place 18 days later, was, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom, a weaker participation than the previous one.
By 8:00, about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Demonstrators in front of the government's building played a theatre scene in which Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Gešev were symbolically imprisoned in the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both belongs to the basic requirements of the protestors.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The protest organiser Nikolaj Hadjigenov said in the public service today that on Wednesday there is a "top escalation" in the form of a "national event in Sofia and a blockade throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the issuing of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already said that he does not intend to resign.
This was due, inter alia, to the need to carry out Bulgaria's pandemic of caweed-19 and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, even though the resignation of the protestor did not calm them down.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government suspended Parliament's vote of confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovich doesn't want to fight without the audience anymore.
Football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlovich has had enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing right now is not football.
I've had my teeth full of games without spectators.
It's a sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks I am," Mihajlovich said before the match against Lecca today.
After the coronavir break, series A matches follow in a fast sequence, and despite playing until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a horrible heat.
He doesn't even know how the teams are doing in these circumstances.
Let's get this season over with.
The measures had to be taken in order to win the competition, but I hope the fans will be back from September," said coach who had led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is unusual, even because four months on the bench was missing due to the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move to a higher level.
We want to continue to grow, and to do so we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, Iran claims.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also from oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian activists said that the fire that erupted in the underground nuclear power in Natanz this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Abbas told journalists according to Iranian media that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic daily faces "thousand cyber attacks".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would manage to reflect.
In the past months, according to Musávi, several wider cyber attacks were recorded, followed by "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not give any more details about potential perpetrators according to Reuters.
Musoví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
This month, an article by Iran’s State Agency, IRNA, discussed how Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could have been behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days as hostages 52 Americans.
Long-term tight relations between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US army killed Iranian General Kassem Soleimany and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdí Muhandise on 3 January.
On January 8, Iran fired at bases in Iraq, where Americans operate, a number of missiles.
U.S.A. has admitted in retreat that dozens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the international nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA's car extended the withdrawal of production, now until 25 May
Cologne car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has re-encouraged production due to coronavir.
Production lines should start again on Monday, 25 May morning.
The event will accompany dozens of hygienic measures, said the spokeswoman of the car Tomáš Paroubek.
Production is due to the pandemic of coronavir from the evening of 18 March.
Initially, the company was planning to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the resignation is, according to Parubka, closed borders and closed dealership, so there is no one to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. for two shifts.
The key markets of the company, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain, are affected by Coronavir.
Mayor Michael Kashpar (A Change for Cologne) said that the TPCA’s production is not signed on to life in the city.
"From the beginning it was known, in the city it was empty.
But the streets have been filling up, especially since Monday, when it's really slowed down.
So the city is full," said Kashpar.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who have stayed at the hostels.
"In those two months we did not have to solve almost any problem," said Kashpar.
For example, Malabopoleslav Škoda Auto, who also stopped production due to the coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works at 100 percent capacity.
The renewal of production in Škod was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday, the third night shift took place in Mlade Boleslav and Kvasinás on Tuesday for the first time after the renewal of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: Left a message to the family
For more than two years, she fought the cancer cancer cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed she had defeated cancer, the disease came back.
A nine - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she could still marry her love of life.
Unfortunately, the sicknesses have fallen.
A few hours after she died, a shocking message appeared on her social network account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson of English Leeds loved bodybuilding.
With a friend named Ricky Moore, who had lived with her for over 16 years, they traveled around the world through competitions.
Ninety-eight-year-old woman had sported and lived healthy, yet cancer was diagnosed in April 2018.
Gemma started an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, a cultural and personal trainer underwent ten-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was useless.
At the beginning of this year, on her nineteenth birthday, the doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, a good - looking blonde decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where her family would visit her at any moment, even organizing her wedding with her love, Ricky.
Marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to the restaurant on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a social network account revealed a contribution that Gemma wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Though I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what caused me this terrible disease.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being on my side all the time and giving me a huge amount of love and support during this terrible time," she wrote on the social network with the fact that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network watchers," she wrote, saying that everyone should appreciate their lives and live them to the full.
Machines for art sell sweatbooks, amulets from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, he gets the passing pocket work by the majority of the beginning Czech artists.
The paintings and other works are made directly for the art, so they know in advance that they have to fit into a size of 8.5 to 5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package is always the curator's text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Wižová, curator of the project.
Artmat's working with a coincidence principle.
Buyer may be surprised at what artistic work he gets.
Currently, he may become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations of Alexandra Stoplová or miniviews from Teresa Bonaventur, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexo associated with a walk through Prague.
Cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created for Artmat a collection of tattoos.
Marie Ladrova and Juliana Chomová sell spiritual pocket packages: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a troubnacy and witch card, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic.
Health payments next year will increase by up to five percent.
A greater increase, according to Vojtěch, is unrealistic
Health payments could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojciech (for ANO) in Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The requirement of experts to increase by up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the State should try to be self-sufficient in providing protection aids.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase in wages can be up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, the current situation should be reflected when it affected the selection of the Coronavir insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread from March.
The income of the insurance companies at the time decreased.
"A 15 percent increase at this point is unrealistic," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZZIS) is likely to reach 88,312 crown this year, sisters 47,498 crown.
The difference between the pay of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data of the Úzis also shows that the removal of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 crowns in 2019 according to the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, experts said that for 2021, they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the treatment of doctors and nurses in state hospitals who have to be followed by pay tables and contract wages in hospitals, regions or private areas.
They therefore also require that health-care boards be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, in doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the president of the Czech dentistry chamber Roman Schmucle, the experts should be aware of the state of this.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit this year to a record CZK 500 billion due to the impact of the caweed epidemic, of which 1.75 billion are to be paid by health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers, according to Schmuckler, disagrees with the flat salary increase next year.
According to him, pay should be decided by the hospitals themselves and by the medical facilities themselves, and the money should also go to them through the pay order.
Vojtěk also stated that hospitals currently have sufficient protective facilities.
President Pavel Švagr of the State Reserve Administration (SSHR) said this week that the administration does not currently have any health care.
He's waiting for the conclusion of the tender.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The shaking smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We're ready. They're sending messages.
"Smart quarantine works, which, of course, improves.
We're going to discuss with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they should not be driving it all again," the Prime Minister said on Sunday on his Facebook show Chau people.
According to him, IT systems and hygienic stations are not sufficiently connected, which have to gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister of Moravian Silesia, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Minister of Defence Jan Pejšek for the Czech Republic stated that he has no information on Sunday's proceedings and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for him to take this step.
The Smart Quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government led by the former Minister's Deputy Roman Prymula.
The trembling project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
And he said the army could take him back.
Inadequacies in the project were previously accepted by the government's authority for IT and digitisation, Vladimír Djurilla, who is in charge of the project.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years it's been self-involved and non-systematic, and now we're trying to unify it within a few months.
I can't do it in a flash.
The people on the march, the poor on the hygiene march, adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Prime Minister Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to "get into politics"
The present island prime minister, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "do not fool around in politics," said Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the movement ANO, has been the prime minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, it won the run-up ANO movement in Ostrava by almost a third of the voter votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term, and with the business experience, I could turn everything around and build it on my feet in that time," said Respect.
He added that, during the second election period, he was allowed to negotiate to some extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," said Macura, who described himself as a hard introvert who doesn't have frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, Macur's possible end in the YES movement has been speculated for a long time.
The server reminds us that Macura has criticised the YES movement several times, for example for the alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, YES supported the election of Zeman's anti-candidate, Jiří Dragos.
From the NAO movement he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is fooling me, I have no immediate motive to end it," said Respect.
Six hundred-year-old Macura graduated from the School of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, among other things, as Director of Walmark Pharmaceuticals.
He also took part in other companies' institutions.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
In late July, Uber will return to Brno, offering transport services.
This is a consequence of the amendment of the law, according to a press statement by the Brno Council for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) on Thursday.
Against Uber in Brno, taxi drivers protested, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, since July the law has changed the conditions for operating conventional taxis and alternative taxis.
He has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On their basis, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is a consequence of a change in the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate within the limits," Kratochil said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or missing taxiometer.
The court issued preliminary measures prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, but last year, Prime Minister Markéta Vanyková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to subsequent court rulings, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it has been stated that, alongside conventional taxis with a light and taxiometer, transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications can be more easily operated.
Too lush celebration in Brno: Flying Chairs fell a foot from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor apartment flew out on Saturday night in Brno office chairs and fell about a foot from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address listed in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window under which there were still chairs and several tins and bats.
"The movement that was carried from the fourth floor room indicated that a rather loud celebration was taking place inside.
The guards went out into the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present at the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine for an explanation," said the spokesman, James Ghanem.
Request to appeal Rafaje will discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss on Monday with coalition social democrats the request for an appeal by the head of the Anti-Monopoly Authority (UOHS) Peter Rafaje.
Rafaje was called on by non-profit organisations to act on the anti-corruption council of the government and also on the Ústecký kraj.
Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is on the ground.
According to information from the Czech Republic, Rafay was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and according to the law, he cannot be appointed third.
His appeal is under the authority of President Milos Zeman.
Alongside the invitation of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecký region.
The reason is to include Rafajo's cases in recent times.
In the past week, the Prime Minister declined to make a request that he introduce the materials and that the government parties take a "some opinion".
He also said that he had not yet agreed with the President, and that no meeting was agreed with him in the near future.
According to OOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Currently.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in meeting with Haytman Jiří Chunk.
The meetings led, among other things, to the decision to compete for a controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which Chunek strongly advocates.
The guy admitted the meeting, according to him, they were dealing with his "senal activities" together.
Rafai speaks similarly.
The representatives of the Ústecké region called on the government to appeal to Rafaje at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the ÚOHS on public procurement under the Heatman Deputy for Transport Jaroslav Kominka is not transparent and has arbitrary character.
Last March, police intervened at the Antimonopoly office for a toy selection.
This June then server Aktuno.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses flats written on the company of influential backstage player ČSSD Alexandra Chuby.
A deposit of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
Rafaj was appointed President of the Competition Office as of 9 July 2009, for the second term by the President of the former Member of Social Democracy in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year term expires.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Authority on a proposal from the Government.
It may only be revoked if it does not perform its functions for more than six months, or is seriously violating the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In blanin library, the workers collapsed in hot heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technique will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in central Blanca regularly.
In warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to endure.
There was a terrible heat and bad air.
The wind didn't help.
That is why I am happy for the air conditioning," said one of the Blanen readers Petr Novotny.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Plápy, temperatures in the building often climbed up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit [30 ° C].
The southern wall of the building is glassy, and in sunny days it works like a glassworks.
"The sun, in addition, resists much of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem for the individual department to vent, because overnight it must be closed for security reasons.
We often do so from morning in the library to thirty degrees," Plumpa said.
The worst part was the studio and the bookshop on the third floor.
And on the floor above the exhibition room and the principal.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children’s department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"A number of times it happened that the librarians collapsed at work and ended up in incapacitated.
The problem also arose regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was no longer breathable there," said Plumpa.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there'll be only three circuits of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic spaces.
The studio and the bookshop on the third floor.
Next, the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda of the Blanen Investment Department.
He added that at the first stage last autumn workers installed an air technician and adjusted the installation.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The town library of Blansko has nearly three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
The resistance of Chicago has eliminated the coronavirus.
Crawford's back in the game.
Not all infected athletes come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL who are silent as a grave about the health status of players and who publish nothing at all.
As one of the few came out of Crawford's line.
A 15-year-old Montréal relative was present only in the first training, and since then he has been missing in the composition.
"I would like to announce to you all that I have been tested positively for Covid-19 and that is why I have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he told me the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford's ready to re-enter the full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything to get into shape as soon as possible," I added.
The seasoned goalie won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goalie is already the tenth season in a row.
Blackhawks are waiting first for the prep duel with St. Louis, then face Edmonton in the front.
Thousands protested against the Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis protested unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the crisis.
The events took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near its official residence or in Tel Aviv park.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's solution to another wave of coronary epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," according to AP, one of the demonstrators wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," stood on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister in office.
He is accused of three causes of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
All charges are denied and referred to as witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, over 300 Witnesses have been summoned.
In Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, the SARS-COV-2 has been confirmed by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily growth of infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, however, in particular at the end of June, the number of infected again began to increase significantly.
Netanyahu’s critics claim that the government did not adequately assist, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
It also bothers protestors that the government is issuing counter-instruction points in the fight against coronavir.
The driver smashed the car against the tree and died.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters.
Tragic accident took place around 23 p.m. at Neveklov's close district leading from the Slap dam.
The driver must have flown into the woods at a great speed and smashed the car by a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, among other things, cut the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by the police.
They ordered an autopsy to explain, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
The end of wasting and scraping one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and betting on sustainability
The Czech garment brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change of strategy.
He cancels his discounts and doesn't want to keep one collection behind the other anymore.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is no novelty.
In the incinerators and landfills, billions of pieces of clothing end up this year.
The view of the slow fastion, often despised approach to clothing, has changed quite rapidly over the last few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi’s goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which is sold thanks to discounts, will simply not buy.
The company does not want to store one collection after another and at the end of each season, the products are cheaper at their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner of Michal Mice, the eras of new and old collections and blindly following fast changing fashion trends are off.
"Most discounted traders already count on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it is actually kind of a scam," says Pietro Filipi Michal Mickka.
Moreover, with its approach, the company wants to support the local business.
"Each our product is made from carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We stress that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing, which is timeless and overseasonal.
Globally, the premium stamp segment of any discount is typical, the price of the product is simply consistent with its quality and the discount is not necessary," Micka adds.
The giant graffiti represents the RAF flyer Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was well liked by the management of the city," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, for his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig went to Great Britain, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF) and subsequently completed pilot training in Africa’s South Rhodes and Palestine.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the summit revolution he visited the Czech Republic and the native Teplice, who gave him honorary citizenship.
Six-four-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been known by people in the street graphic industry under the name of Camo, has been spraying in the heat streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that were identified by the then Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) for this purpose.
Storm Hanna arrived on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (not before midnight SELČ for today).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 20 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, and, as it moved over the mainland, it weakened in a tropical storm.
Yet, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger to coastal residents.
Because it brought with it strong wind and intense precipitations; along with local floods, according to the AP, wastes of electricity and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of natural disaster on Saturday for 32 districts in the southwest of Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were given by the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay Bay Bay Bay, but it was intended to reach a territory nearly 500 kilometres long before it gradually moved over northeast Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous storm and a unique tornado pose a threat," the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning, the local time (morning SELČ) was moving in the area of the American-Mexico border and was accompanied by a wind at a speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was driven by wind at speeds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but during the land process it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which left Hanna out of the Hurricane category again.
The local authorities called on the storms to stay at home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas is one of those U.S. states that the disease pandemic covid-19 is the most severe.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is a great challenge and possible evacuation.
Provision shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelters after evacuation, which had a positive test for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to diseases.
Local authorities have called on everyone evacuated to take towels and disinfectants with them to hide, if possible.
"We still don't have it far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP by Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions suggest that in some places, within a few hours, there may be up to 300 millimetres of precipitation, in some cases of no less than 500 millimeters, which could flood a number of coastal areas together with sea levels.
Zeman will lend Colonel Lipk's general rank
President Miloš Zeman on Wednesday will lend Colonel Paul Lipk's general rank.
This comes from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for borrowing the rank of Brigadier General is the August takeover of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka is still acting as the deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Rehkka as deputy commander of the multinational division of the north-east in the Polish Elblag, who is in charge of the alliance's forward presence in Poland and Pobaltí.
In March, she became Director of the National Directorate for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the President that Lipk borrow the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be lent to a soldier for the duration of the elected function or for the duration of the service task which requires the borrowing of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the General rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been lent shall have the same rights and duties as to be appointed to this rank.
However, he does not have the right to make a payment that would correspond to a given rank.
The borrowing of rank takes time to overlook the reason for which it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
In a significant way they participate in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence put forward a proposal for promotion in June.
The mid-term promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. in Prague Castle and will be attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of Staff Aleš Opat.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of new coronavir.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
The agreed standards include compliance with the distance or wearing of towels on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
She's informed Reuters about this.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to maintain the recommended distance in the case of safety checks and departure at the airport.
In aircraft, sufficient fresh air must be guaranteed and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Because different standards have caused confusion.
There was a temperature record on the Arctic Hzitzberki, where they measured almost 22 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Fahrenheit [1.7 ° C.], and by 0.4 degrees [0.4 ° C.], he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberky, located about 1,300 kilometres from the northern pole.
The spindles are heated faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the danger posed by the warming of other regions of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to the report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Research last year.
According to him, the average temperature in Špicberki has risen from the 1970s by three to five degrees.
By the year 2100, it can climb even ten degrees unless greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere.
The temperature growth in Špicberky can result in an ever-frozen soil that threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause even more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
The British, who will return from Spain, are awaiting compulsory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain, which are not necessary, due to the risk of disease spreading cavid-19.
The Canary and Balearic islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after they return to isolation for two weeks.
New rules enter into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the spread of the virus in Britain," the British Diplomacy said in her statement.
"We have always made it clear that if we need it, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement affects the travel plans of thousands of British people.
For Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British, among other things, have concerns about whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation after returning from vacations for 14 days.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten - day vacation on Lanzarote, and was scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been ordered since December.
"We had to go to the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver, and I don't think my employer is going to join me when I get back from a vacation for two weeks in quarantine," the daily Metro Hunter quoted it as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
Over the last two days, over 900 newly infected people have always arrived in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening up the coronavir measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all night life and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has highlighted the increased risk of disease in Catalonia, Aragonia, Basque Country and Madrid.
Dukovan electricity buyout model will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss Monday's electricity purchase model from the planned new block of Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill provides that, if the buying-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the buying-in price is lower than the market price, the consumer impact will be reversed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save money because of the construction of electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook on electricity prices in markets is always uncertain, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The intention had already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The buying-in price may be both at the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread among customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the material.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to increase and the people at Dukoven construction will earn money.
Otherwise, the impact in the tens of crowns per family will be far less, according to him, than is paid annually in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the buying-in price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) for megawatthour (MWh).
The material submitted shall not contain any draft amount, shall not be included in the buy-in contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, at which traders are now most stocked, is currently around EUR 45 (asi 1190 CZK) for MWh.
"In the difference between the buying-in price and the market price of the power plant of 10 euros, the average household may make an allowance with a consumption of 3,3 MWh per year - it may correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including electric hot boards and ovens, but it does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MPO government said.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The pandemic of coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecasting of market prices to be an express speculative issue," the CTC said earlier, the executive director of the Energy Investment Group, Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by an MPO, and that it would be entrusted by a legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The investor-state agreement guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not longer until the operation of low-carbon production.
The low carbon production design defines as a nuclear power plant connected to an electrical system with installed capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček had previously stated that the new Dukovan bloc should have power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodin electricity annually, which would correspond to the tenth expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The government approved the model of financing the new Dukvan bloc on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State in construction without an interest rate, with an interest of 2 per cent for operation.
The financing model is opposed to opposition, and the possibility of Dukovany building Russian or Chinese companies is also hindering it.
The state should share 70 percent in the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all additional costs.
CEZ Director-General Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected sum for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the State and CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Local Development downloaded material to support tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the internet and on billboards for advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn by the Office from the comments procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) server ListNews.cz said she was still working on the material.
The eKlep document (electronic library of the legislative process) was notified on Friday by the Zdřevy.cz server.
The Ministry of Planning has justified the collapse of tourism due to coronavir.
During the Coronavir crisis, the media also suffered a decline in income.
The proposal called for criticism of opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now to look at the hlidacstat.cz website, the MMR planned to put money on television, radio, press, internet, billboards or station areas through the Czech Tourism Travel Agency.
Most of the money, 700 million crowns, would be on TV.
Most would get private TVs from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would receive 400 million and the same piece would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which are once again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and station or metro areas.
The tourism promotion campaign in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and last a year.
"It is still working on the material, it is definitely not in the form that it should be presented so far," Dostálová said without further details of the List of Reports server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to TOP 09 boss Békarova Adamová, media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertisement.
"I firmly believe that this showy contempt will be received in the autumn at the polls between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
Sufficiently rejects the fact that it is to help the media affected by crises.
"It may even be coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday, N.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course, we still count it, it can be less and more.
It is a work material," she added.
Rescue initiative Let's not give a media campaign to support home tourism.
"We want two billion for the tourism companies, not a unnecessary advertising campaign," the president of the initiative Tomáš Barčík said Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should direct companies, not the media, to write an initiative in an open letter to the government.
The spark of life, the cocking of beer and death as the stalk of grass
The third album with the title and death is the grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fritz, who left also a year ago on May 24.
In Frič's discograph is the fifth item and, like previous titles, there is also the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is itself an excellent artist.
Frič, the year of 1949, was of course influenced by the American Beat generation, but he carried this inspiration through his own, specially given experiences and also very internal expressions of faith.
However, if he spoke or wrote about faith, he was always very intimate, unaggressive, absolutely tolerant.
I'm thinking about Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will be pardoned.
Fričova album offers records of author's reading from 2006, but also of performances with musicians who have always very sensitively accompanied him, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartonň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - I like - with the words of the island poet Peter Hruška about the long poems of Frič.
"She was sallowing them with pride and unending bitterness," writes Pearce, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly plunged into dull consumer vanity and greed, is increasingly distant from what its soul was made of - from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a squabble among those who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest, but who also knew that it was only for the common cause that I could not give up.
The poets reminded us that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not irrelevant how he loses it.
If he bids a general fall, he will sceptically give up, he will faint, or he will remain in peace and pride at the last moment on what he believes and what he loves."
Maw Maw isn't my advisor, Hamáček said.
The former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CzechSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor to social democracy.
The Party’s President and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček communicates with him only and reads his views and articles.
The hamster said it on the Prima Party TV show today.
About Paroubek being Hamáček's advisor, the News.cz server informed on Friday.
"Sometimes we write an essay, he sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that it was not, however, official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that sometimes I read his opinion, so there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS Member Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "underly listen to Václav Klaus' views".
It is in his view that this is because it is an experienced policy and former party president, which is also the case of Parubka.
The fact that the media is making it into an affair has marked this year's cucumber season as a mark.
Server Reports.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is playing Hamáček's role as an unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former president of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is connected to Parubek and acted as Vice-President of his LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate will not be commented until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile head, he's a kick in the ass, poor Swedish challenger.
The 22-year-old American champion has the ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat young Duplantiss, and last year he was beaten by the NCAA National Association.
"We had a battle a year ago, he won and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases it was a very good fight," describes Nielsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has fired a steep upward shot since then and is currently isolated in the top bars.
In just 20 years, he became a world record player, this year on 8 February, in Toruni, he overcame a bar of 6,17 metres, a week later in Glasgow he added a centimeter.
"Jumping six metres already in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent by ten.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
Although Nilsen's number of successes is thinner than the one Duplantis boasts, the American has similar goals.
In February this year, he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he was in the US championship for the World Championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"When you can succeed at this level, you can no doubt do the same on events such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Panamerican Games."
However, because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are set aside, which gives Nielsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily race under five circles to turn into just a silver fight?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think it'll be possible anytime soon," Nielsen thinks.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile head in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's going to want to increase it.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands of years in the disability pension of an impenetrable son.
She's in court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman is threatened with imprisonment for up to eight years.
Because of his poor health, the sick man’s justice was removed, and his mother was appointed guardian, who, among other things, was to manage his son’s money.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 until this January used part of her son's disability pension for her needs and prepared him for 440,000 crowns," police spokesman Dana Ladman said, saying that the accused woman is making it difficult for her to protect the interests of the injured person as guardian.
Although the wife, according to the court's instructions, set up an account for her son, but his pension was sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs associated with the stay of his son in a medical facility and the payment of the necessary medications, he used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electric appliances and household walk," the indictment states.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own sake, the woman confessed.
But she argued by helping with them in paying for family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to pull household passages.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It's always been about things that my son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son money back.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The findings of the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 instruments of calcium, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointy objects that could serve as scrapes or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published in Nature magazine on this topic.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite Cave, located at high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory has been that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the mainland bridge from the area of Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spikes of spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this slaughter culture has subsequently spread in much of North America.
This model, however, has suffered cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two or three thousand years older.
In a second study published in Nature magazine, there are 42 different locations throughout North America that demonstrate human presence on the continent already between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people might have come to North American land before previously assumed.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is obvious that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said new findings by anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada.
The interest in tickets so far fills with an optimistic scenario, the sellers claim.
Prices decrease gradually as well
He sells a flight to the Czech Republic every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly half, but demand increases by 20 percent every week.
The post-crisis development thus fills the most optimistic scenarios according to vendors.
Flight prices are also gradually decreasing.
The most sought-after destinations are the sellers of the South European States in particular.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letuska.cz, flights to Split are sold most of the time.
From other countries, then, the most prominent United Kingdom is, however, one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
At Letuska.cz, it was about 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, by 3,000 crowns less each year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for the European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy tickets with much less advance than before because they fear further development of the coronary situation.
According to previous information, Kiwi.com reduced its flight time by about ten days before departure.
"This confirms the future trend in which people will order flights with much less advance, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President for the products Kiwi.com Michal Šindelár.
Currently, the average time of reservation before departure is 21 days.
Along with sales growth, the number of renewed airline lines from the Czech Republic is also rising.
Regular links to more than 60 destinations are currently operating at Prague airport.
The summer season last year is about half of the destinations.
The grand finale is already tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the organisation of the PDC has reached the grand finale.
It introduces an experienced nine-year-old Scottish shooter Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson cut out Justin Pip in the first round, and then he ran into his neighbor in a tabular ladder.
Even James Wade, however, had counseled and in the quarterfinals, he argued with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world's number one.
The Flying Scot was in the semifinals, facing Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he fled the tomb from the shovel, in extension dominated and after the result 18:16 he won a place in the final tournament, which he had already won in 2018, when in an amazing battle defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and it is possible that the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The 16-year-old arrowman first abruptly cut off the world's six Nathan Aspinall, pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and in the quarterfinal after the sharp onset, Adrian Lewis was beaten.
The big check was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength for the introduction, but calmly playing the Belgian then won an excellent series of headways, which he held to the end more or less without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high score, which he encountered occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Cases of coronavir occurred at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus in the Czech Republic was first discovered, 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are ill.
This results from data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred times each.
Maxim was a Friday 281 cases.
On Thursday it was positive 235 tested, the day before 246 and Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 infected arrived.
There are 9,590 people in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all infected.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in terms of 100,000 inhabitants still exhibits Karvinsko, almost 59.
Following is Jihlava district with 56 and Frydecko-Místecko with 36 infected to 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been applied in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear clothes at internal mass events over 100 people, it's cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced from the current thousand people to the half.
In the world, the number of people who have been shown to be infected with the new coronavir has already exceeded 16 million.
According to the American University of Johns Hopkins, the evolution of the pandemic is global.
The balance of the victims who died with the disease covid-19 is close to 645,000 according to this source.
The latest million infected came to statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States has registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, with nearly 1.4 million people infected by the authorities.
The infected now arrive at a record rate.
This week, the World Health Organization announced that more than 284,000 new cases had arrived from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the peak in the people like the United States, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
For example, it concerns Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, or Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, and the first case is officially announced today by KLDR.
The air in the household is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in rural areas, but also at home.
Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on human health, had already quoted The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abrahama, who deserved the creation of the Israeli Ministry of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on household damage right now that many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to research by the US Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of household air is up to five times worse than that of the outdoors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that because of poor air quality in their homes, 3.8 million people die annually.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, the quality of "home air" is almost non-existent.
Dangerous, however, may be things with which a person normally comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas also produces clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may experience problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritability, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergy.
Internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged during long-term exposure to unhealthy substances.
Not all damage, but from objects within the household, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
