In my view, the literature programme was shaped by ladies of Balzakov's age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilewsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, in terms of the very ladies of Balzakov's age.
And the psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroes are not that interesting for adolescents.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Matthews Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropackage Prestige: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different strengths of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft, a plate of natural latex.
The spring block from 1000 springs per square metre is rapidly adapted to the sleeping body, warning the appearance of “free” or “gamaca”.
Among the virtues of the model, breathing materials should be made available.
The latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, like the coconut cohort.
This preserves a healthy microclimate of the bedroom.
The mattress is also covered by an extended guarantee period.
The period of official guarantee from the manufacturer is 5 years, the real life of the mattress is higher.
Dust and pollution protection is provided by a decommissioned cauldron from the Jacquard supplied in the kit.
It is recommended to maintain the optimum position of the spine during sleep.
The charger determines the design of the parties — coconuts serve as anatomic support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Germany: Fourth Coronation Conviction Inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
In the opinion of the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final but would continue with renewed force.
Despite the active campaign in Germany, not two or three doses of the vaccine from the coronavirus are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reported on Saturday, December 11.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be necessary in summer, at the latest in autumn”, the expert said.
In addition, Wygelt hopes that the fourth vaccination from the coronavirus can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccines”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of Omicron.
But the new option is extremely dangerous.
So the probability of re-infecting Omicron is three times higher than the Delta or Beta strains.
This is illustrated by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer by March 2022 plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron.
Companies stress that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against contamination by a new variant of Omicron.
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that two doses of vaccines showed that efficacy was significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential was reduced by more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron contamination," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chair of the German Infectious Disease Society Bernd Zaltzberger advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Vobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old
Bet-A-Vib is a special branch of Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from a number of other Vibs by the fact that it was originally created with respect to the use of navigable fishing rather than just for the purpose of fishing.
These are larger than those of the analogues, a certain weight, which is no doubt a positive influence on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another known feature is the top plate of solid and tensile plastic, which creates additional vibration shades in vertical and horizontal conductions.
As the "Winter Vib" in catching the Bet-A-Vib tag, it shows a pretty aggressive game.
Often, simple monotonous animations are the most catchable, i.e. motions up and down almost without pauses.
In planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, crushed by underwater vegetation, roots and other obstacles for which a lock is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant in the winter catch of the vessel and the large perch, especially in the middle of winter, when an accurate and aggressive bait is required.
Having reached the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib shall immediately turn and return to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used successfully for the winter spring trout.
You can choose from or without a noise capsule (NS-NanoSound) from two modifications to suit its whims.
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive pike that does not even respond to the nerve.
When catching Bet-A-Vib, it shows range and accuracy.
This vabbler is understood and not capricious, well combined with wood and knitting cords, even large diameters.
For the purpose of catching the hammer, the vessel, the coat of arms, or the shell, except for the uniform contemporaneous and the step, sometimes with the snorkeling at the bottom.
If you catch in the occupied areas, you can change the front triangle into a doppelganger, thus reducing the likelihood of congestion.
Among the baits of its class Bet-A-Vib are among the most sustainable in work and, consequently, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, it can be used in both relatively small and deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries declared
Libya has more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the High Council of State of the Republic of Khaled Al-Mishri stated this.
“There are currently more than 7,000 VAC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also rock trances in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 jet aircraft on Gardabi airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , and his words are derived from Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “trying to seize” the central part of Libya extending from Chad to the Mediterranean after “bringing their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keep Presence
In the opinion of the interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as airbase in Jufra, has been noted in the Agency's publications.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that VAC Wagner has the support of the Kremlin.
Where More Mercenaries Can Be
According to the agency, Wagner is suspected to operate in nine countries in Africa: the Central African Republic, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagneri subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the Wagnerians allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is neither in the force department nor in the Jurlic registry, and its fighters are not in the forms of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Remember, earlier, 27 EU countries had approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto is the second Chamber of Parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of Parliamentary deputies and the Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
“Until the election, less than two weeks remain, and the chances of their passing are rapidly decreasing” is noted in the material.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed for an indefinite period a final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Russian External Policy
38% of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29% believe failure prevails.
"Syria's success stories -- "protected, restored the world there," "North Stream 2 solution," "the whole world was afraid that the cool weapons," "The Crime of We Resisted."
The main failures are the “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from peace”, said a study of the Social Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai Government has completely renounced paperwork - all the servants have also become digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paperwork and digitalization.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirate Information Agency WAM.
“Today has marked the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai’s life — we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government”, said the Emirate Crown Prince, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external documents in all Dubai States will now be digitally available only through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health care, the JCC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to an electronic government and the digitization of the document process began in Dubai from 2018.
Since then, the authorities have estimated that 336 million paper sheets have been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobjanin stated that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkish car production and export declined below 2020
Turkey's production and export of cars decreased sharply in November against the depreciation of lira.
As a result, 11 months of industrial output were worse last year, Bloomberg reported, referring to data from the Association of Road Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the Association, 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20 per cent lower than the year before.
Some 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, more than 25 per cent of which were returned to last year's indicator.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey ' s automotive sector showed a positive trend by last year, the result of the 11 months 2021 was 0.3 per cent lower than last year ' s average.
The reason for this decline was a sharp decline in the Turkish lira rate, which cost 29 per cent over the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS entities received a credit payment delay in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov described the situation in which small and medium-sized business benefits are granted, reports the MIA correspondent Kazinform.
“For the information of the Financial Market Management and Development Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the mandate of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency of 9 April 2021 issued an order No. 127 concerning the approval of the deferral of payments on loans to entities of small and medium-sized business”, said Alihan Smaylov in his reply to the deputation request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferral of payments on loans was for banks and microfinance organizations to postpone payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to IAS entities, including the IP, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days on the choice of the entity of IAS.
The borrower ' s statement could indicate a different period of deferral of payments.
During the delay with respect to the borrower, the claim-claim work was suspended, the notification of the need to repay outstanding debts, as well as the creditor's charging of commissions and other payments," noted the prime minister.
For 2021, second-level banks received claims for deferral of payments on loans of 603 IAS entities, of which 553 IAS entities received a tenge of 9.7 billion.
In IFF, 131 entities of the IAS, of which 95 entities have been granted a delay of 105.8 million tenge, were requested for deferral," concluded A. Smaylov.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry the strain of Oxyron.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry it easier than those who have a strong protective response to the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strain of the Oxyron coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason is to search for a virus.
Scientists believe that Oxyron is born in a body infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
I mean, he didn't find any resistance to immunity in a mutation.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very quick.
Apparently, there's more of these spikes, the spikes, than it's supposed to be, they didn't cut their antibodies during mutations, says Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry “Ocmyrone” more easily than those who have a strong protective response to the body.
Turns out, the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens when you get pneumonia when you're 30 years old, and you're 60 years old and you're sick of it.
The immune response of the young man is completely inadequate: where a finger could only be threatened, it beats like a sparrow gun, Sergey Purassev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only symptoms - the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the initiation of intoxication of the body - temperature, weakness, and infirmity.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, shortness of breath, coughing.
Pain to the right or to the left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age could be vaccinated.
Viruslogist, the head of the MFTI Genome Engineering Laboratory, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very active in the process of being affected by the yeast.
Adolescents who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active laundromat like kindergarten teachers, said Pavel Wolczkov, a virologist, the head of MFTI's genetic engineering laboratory.

Teath-In.
In the '70s and '80s, no dancer was without the tunes of that group.
And the houses, together with their friends, danced under their music.
Immunologists have made a hypothesis as to why people get obese and become victims of the yeast.
The authors examined fat from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells found in fatty tissues, macrophages, have also been infected, with a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of the patients who died from the yeast and discovered particles of the coronary virus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to be hidden in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid responding to the immune system.
The SARS-Cov-2 is probably capable of this.
The biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Semin Goloseikin, described the causes of dementia and described its methods of prevention in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, people are difficult to guide even in a familiar environment.
Glaseikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins were most common to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a low-moving lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decrease the level of abstract thought.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of WHO disease, it recommends maintaining the required level of physical loading, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic involvement.
Previously, Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of FGAOU IN THEIR
N.I. Pyrogova, head of cognitive violations of the Federal Centre for the Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepov, spoke about the causes of problems with memory.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artefacts
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its homeland some 30,000 artefacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on television channel Al-Hayat by the Chief Inspector of the Department of the Returned Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Howad.
Since 2011, 29,300 artefacts have been recovered by the Egyptian State.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Howad explained that all the artefacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
The department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “saw auctions worldwide and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian sites as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that on return, cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the restored artifacts was found in Belgium by an ancient skeleton of a man who is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol for assistance in finding Pharaoh Tutankhamun's bust sold at the London auction.
Christie's auction house held auctions on 4 July, where a bust over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art was illegally removed from the Carnac temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been auctioned since 1985.
The way the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively sought to repatriate illegally removed monuments of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled antiquity is the result of archaeological exploration of “black diggers”.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account," and that's right, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people — so many Tatars — live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of the people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff's personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its staff with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone by a partner, a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its staff as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member has used it to meet with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many staff members have moved to remote mode, the Bank wishes to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff members to learn about the new rule.
Credit Suisse does not officially comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but harder for the earthly being of the poet and his ego.
He was already outside of any literary associations, he was involved with imaginism, he was himself, but he was known, wanted, sometimes strongly mocked by critics, even evilly, but the reader was ready to carry him.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them are actual masterpieces, completed the cycle of the Persian Motives, written by the poem Anna Snowgine, published by 8 books, the Russian Soviet.
And the main success -- at the end of June 25th, the landlord concluded a treaty with Eseni to produce its works in the 3rd volume.
None of Sergey Alexandrovich's modern poets have had such an honor, he's the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the contract fee amounted to 1,000 roubles a month for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 roubles a month, the engineer 200).
The funds were needed that year more than ever.
Essenin married the granddaughter of Lviv Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, and had to maintain a family home, contain sisters Kathu and Sasha, as well as a mother.
It's like life is filled, there's something to be happy about, but it's all set up mostly in dark tones, like a nightmare from the Black Man poem (written in November 1925 and published after Essenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Does the wind wheeze?
Above the barren and barren plain,
And when I grew up in September,
He's brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Essenin had given up, looked ill, and apparently was ill.
There's more and more noises, there's a lot of nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably not just in alcoholism...
Moreover, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism - Sergey Alexandrovich was behaving, there were no reliable documents left.
For example, in May 1923, when Essenin insisted on the fourth wife, American women of Aysedora Duncan repaired health at the Paris clinic at Professor Peter Gannushkin (the foundation of Essenin would be two years later in Moscow).
These are proofs of the poet's songs, of the scandals on this soil, of the police being carried out enough by dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, a terrible novel by a poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin settled for a short time with a friend, imaginist Ivan Starceva.
Surprisingly, Essenin, with very good income, never had his own home in Moscow or in Peter, turned to rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old man remembers:
"I have come only to sleep, and in most cases, in an inebriated, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Essenin fell on a staircase...
Falling, scratching his face and wheezing.
With a little self-absorbed, he began to cough constantly, squandering the whole plain with blood..."
And so was Essenin after the European and U.S. War (then there was a dry law in the United States, but Duncan accepted quite a supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except baboons and streets...
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, he was drinking, of course...
And I drank because the toast bit."

Matrix Promtex-Oriented Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Oriented Duet Latex Econom is a modern performance of the budget model in a premium class ambulance.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent dual springs duet.
Inside the large spring there is a softer spring of small size.
This allows for an even distribution of the load on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by an artificial latex.
It's a analog of a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and tenacity of this material enhances the comfortable effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is ideal for couples with a wide difference in weight (from 30 kg).
With smart springs, there's no wave effect when an easy partner goes on the heavy side.
A nice, soft-to-the-steel touch of Sense practical jacquard will be sewn through with a layer of synthepon.

He's much more responsible than I was in his age or my husband, who had a legal problem before the wedding.
Father takes care of his young daughter.
And he likes it like he wrote Lermontov, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she didn't miss it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school.
She'll have a tail.
So what?
He'll pass.
Millions of students know that.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms” against the EU
The Ministry of the Interior of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Jablonski expressed the view that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus had used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such an “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper, the relevant MID heading statement was made.
According to Jablonski, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he “has been actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As the website kp.ru had written, the European Union had previously implemented the fifth sanctions package against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they expressed their readiness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by introducing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not Sakka's hat." When a velvet jacket makes a man laugh.
In 2021, velvet jackets dominated world events.
Perhaps the first person to make his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first awarded the eco-premium award ceremony The Earthshot Prize an incompatible royal dress code with a green velvet jacket, and then chose a more classic version to support the Royal Variety charity fund.
A few weeks ago, the trend was similar to that of Lionel Messiah.
A football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a velvet jacket, Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvety men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service analysts at Gazetu.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with pads and silhouettes, the main colors are dark and beige, brown, dark and blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6,000 rubs, while men prefer to buy pure jackets - they choose less.
There is more to buy than online retailers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the barhot luxury segment this season is represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the premiere films of Dom Gucci, the ambassador of the Jared Leto brand.
If you choose expensive marks, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Due to the special interlacing technology of the tendon, there is solid tissue with a corrosive outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
A fashion expert, Lamoda Ilya Wahoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it is not his model or his fasso, but his relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so it is ideal if you attend a party or a solemn event," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion that allows for the choice of a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, needs to be aware of the right advanced bagging,” the authors of the Telegram Channel on the male fashion "Brammel Beauty". - The owners of velvet pajamas tend to belong to the caste of those who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same loads: classic jackets with darts, uniformed shirts, silk tie, loofahs with brushes, straps.
Too simple and everyday things will seem inappropriate.
The fashion experts from Beauty Brammel are confident that the appearance of a regular corporate employee in a velvet jacket would be inappropriate, and that is, “the manager of the company’s management is yes, it’s the subject”.
If the serving is lower and the aim is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out financial bonuses, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will appreciate this with the phrase “not Sekka hat” - according to the editors of the Telegram Channel on male fashion.
Very mixed sensations of voice.
It's an unnatural templar, so worn out.
And she's completely out of touch with a nice young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I desire good luck!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is to say, it's paid.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has grown.
Traditional energy is also not in the tax, both gas and oil, and coal has been bought cheaper than it is now sold.
To fuel wild demand.
It's dripping.
Then who's in the spring?
As usual, a regular buyer.
Do the Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered to be idiots who are “lost” in the energy crisis.
They've done their job.
For a good wage.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocre in the middle of a statistical passenger.
Perhaps if such characters are confident of their beauty so much that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, they won't fall for it, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “beautiful” people, but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, “a slave conscious of his slavery and fighting against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and who is perplexing in the silent, unconscious, and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he complacently describes the beauty of a slave's life and admires a kind and good gentleman has a holopa, ham."
Immunologist stated that the 4-5 months reoccupation would help to protect against the strain of omicron.
Revaccination after four or five months can protect against a new strain of coronary infection omicron.
This statement was made by the immunologist Nikolay Krüchkov, who called the bait six months later, given the emergence of the new strain, “a very long period”
“In previous strains, it was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, calling in parallel with the educational campaign, for reoccupation.
Kručkov also noted that early reactivation provided a good titre of neutralising antibodies.
“If a person has been given two vaccinations and a booster, or has become sick and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and overtaken, he has received “hybrid immunity”, i.e. the antibody is sufficiently neutralizing”, the expert explained.
“Big Seven” warned Russia about “substantial consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The larger seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the Heads of MIDs in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine will “have enormous consequences and cost money” to Moscow, but no concrete measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the strengthening of Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, the statement said.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “decline escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities”, as President Biden spoke during the video call to President Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the standard format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the “Big Seven” Foreign Ministers also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have enormous consequences and a serious price in response," they cautioned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restricted position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier this day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed “one vote of the larger seven countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have tremendous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech against the micron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than that of the other types of disease.
Researchers at the University of Hong Kong and the University of China, Hong Kong, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the baseline Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety”, said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remained the most reliable way to protect against severe contagion with coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron strains could cause a new wave of viral circulation and increase mortality unless further measures were taken.
The head of the Ukraine Mine Defence accused the FWG of blocking NATO arms transfers to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former Chancellor of the FRG, Angela Merkel, of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that Germany had vetoed the purchase of anti-aircraft systems and rifles by Ukraine last month.
It is noted, however, that later Berlin reduced its position on rifles by recognizing their non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
However, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier Sunday, Ambassador Andrey Melnik of Ukraine in Germany expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver arms to Chancellor Scholce.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms at risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite Russia's “occupation” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “non-logical” position, confident diplomat, Germany will also retain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to be “a partner of Ukraine in technical terms”, the president added.
It was also noted that the Co-Chair of the Green Party, Robert Habek, visited the Republic this spring in favour of the sale of Kiev for defence weapons.

The meeting also noted that they condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces outside the country.
“The Russian Federation should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have serious consequences and serious costs”, said a statement published on the British Government ' s website.
The Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that they “are united in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
British MB Chief Elizabeth Truss, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).

Undiscovered means of returning stolen money through the Internet store
There are several ways to recover money stolen through Internet stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in a conversation with the RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of major losses in bank data, it is recommended that core funds be kept on a map or a bank account that is not used for online shopping.
A portion of the savings may be deposited in the savings account and disposed of as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate online purchase card.
If money has been stolen from stores that do not use 3D Secure, a refund procedure can be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by the payment systems for unauthorized transactions performed without the use of 3D Secure, the participant is liable to the account chain that does not use the service”, said the representative of the Promsbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zarzba stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to a bank to challenge a fraud operation no later than 120 days after purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require two-factor authorization, the transaction could be protested and the money recovered.
In some cases, it is noted that the Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution in the current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints of online fraud.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss Northern Stream-2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected Chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops within Ukraine and the situation with Russia's Northern Stream-2 pipeline.
Although Scholtz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki of Poland said that he would urge Scholtz to speak against “North Stream-2” for which Russian gas is expected to be delivered to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland ' s efforts to halt the flow of migrants trying to reach a country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would assist Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right party “Right and justice” violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay a fine and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German Government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not undertake to stop the work of Northern Stream-2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the halting of the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a high-ranking United States Congress official reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by the Greater Seven on Sunday.

Our money in the church wall will be paid to the plumber $20,000
Santechnik, who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians would be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Santechnician Justin Coughley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages of money and cheques under thermal insulation.
He passed on the discovery of the church and said that he did not receive a thank - you note from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the discovery was linked to a theft that occurred in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then some $200,000 went missing in cash and $400,000 in checks stored in a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, for information on criminals, a $25,000 reward was announced.
Justin Coughley could not claim that amount because the prize has expired.
In spite of this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time awarding $5,000 and later receiving another $20,000 in gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the santechnician.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier, it had been reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found on the wall of the Lakewood Church.

A virologist, a doctor of medical science, a deserving Russian scientist, Anatoli Altstein, spoke with Ura.ru, revealed a pattern of full protection against a coronary infection.
According to him, this could be done by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
Intranasal use, a large number of A immunoglobulins are produced. This does not occur when injecting the vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you get a lot of A and G immunoglobulins, but there's not yet a double vaccination solution," the doctor said.
UrFO's chief prophylaxis doctor, Sergei Tokarev's medical sciences, stated that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination together with the injection was the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body was supposed to be maximum.
Earlier, Health Minister David Melick-Guseinov said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a new coronary infection among children.
He said that this was the picture in other countries, where another wave of pandemic had come before.

WHO has discovered omicron in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the Omicron Crown had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO communication.
According to the organization, as at 9 December, strains have already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It is with the fact that it has become active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of dissemination of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on preliminary data may go away at the rate of delta strains, which is an Indian version of the coronavirus, which now operates in all absolute countries without exception.
Prior to that, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhan Gebreyesus stated that Omicron States could have a significant impact on the movement of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also come to Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the omicron will wipe out the delta in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million, with the official omicron currently suffering a few hundred people in the Kingdom, and estimated at 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at the peak of hospitals, more than 2,000 people will be transported daily.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech against the strain omicron is 32 times lower than the other types of disease.
How she reacts to the Russian Sputnik V, yet unknown, will become clear in the coming few weeks.
The Gamalea Centre has only just begun a test of the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.

Russia warned of a new scheme of fraud
The evildoers began to seek new maneuvers for video fraud.
This is referred to as "Investments" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the director of the product, the main danger associated with the dissemination of video communications is dipfaics.
In this case, a fake video is being created on the basis of actual records involving the victim.
This enables neurosets to reproduce accurately the characteristics of a person’s behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a dipface, maliciouss can call familiar victims on video links or create a video clip of a person for dating purposes.
“Such counterfeits may cause a bulling, as a coerced con artist can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenaries,” said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkoll, in turn, noted that psychologically people are more trusted when others see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.

Five actions are listed to help avoid diabetes.
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, nor do they.
Sugar diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive activities play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of different drinks and changing to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when used in excess quantities.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only is eating wrong but habits having an effect on the occurrence of the disease.
Much movement is needed to reduce the risk of diabetes.
Specialists advise that you follow a low-carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight but also protect you from sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, many cells need to be eaten.
Food fiber fills the stomach and thus helps to create a sense of richness, secretion of nutrient juices and increase food intake.

Dr. Pavlova described the "migrene of the weekend" of the laborers
Several factors may lead to a deterioration of self-esteem in weekends
The cause of self-esteem after working hours is often the “migrement of the day off”, explained a prominent doctor-endocrinologist, a candidate for medical science, a senior research officer at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of ICU, a science director at the Zuhr Pavlov System Medicine Clinic in his telegram channel.
She said that it is particularly common for workers who suffer from headaches, fragility, and weakness during the weekends.
Dr. Pavlov noted that in addition to a week of accumulated fatigue, there are plenty of objective reasons for the body’s negative response to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives are changing dramatically.
"In the long run, we've been lying on the couch all day, probably eating more and drinking less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and water shortages, gravity and fragmentation.”
An additional role is played by the late recovery.
So if you get up three hours later, you get a reaction called a jetlag.
It arises from travelers who cross several watch belts.
In order to determine which factor plays a crucial role in the deterioration of self - interest, Paul recommended that the most important thing be changed during the weekend.

South Africa scientists have declared that Pfizer vaccine against omicron is not effective.
In South Africa, Pfizer vaccine against omicron was reported to be of low effectiveness.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronary infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of the omicron) corresponds to (the level) the vaccine’s vaccine effectiveness of 22.5 per cent against the infection with symptoms, which ... raises doubts about the vaccine’s ability to protect against infection, according to a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts explained that the drug could save you from severe illness.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics with more frequent hospitalizations in Britain than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess can lead to type 2 diabetes and cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that a hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to calorie sugar, composition and glycaemic index, may be mentioned under a strange word in the product.
Several dozen names may be presented on the label, essentially marking sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
Other raw sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from maize), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black path), agave syrup, etc. may also be used.
These are all simple hydrocarbons that are related to mono- and disaccharides, and they may not only be in food products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to the Russian Federation, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and raw products, as well as to draw attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product is syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the quantity of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total quantity of sugar may be much higher than that indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for the FRG in 25 years
The new chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, said that gas imports were losing importance to Germany, as the country was continuing its transition to the decarbonization of the economy.
He said that by 2045 Germany planned to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, 25 years from now, the world will be such that the issue of gas transport to the FWG and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to be committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is important to the energy transition at the moment.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement recording the support of Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Previously, the head of Germany's MID, Annalen Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the Northern Stream - 2 pipeline was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline had not yet “compliant with the requirements” of the European Union.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous referendums.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, most New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in the third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, “For the independence of New Caledonia from France” was expressed by 3.51% (2,755) of voters, while 96.49% (75,762) voted “against”.
It was 43.90 per cent, and more than 80,000 New Caledonians participated in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections has left no room for doubt”, since the supporters of independence have called on voters not to vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed the referendum on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Archipelago prevented a full and “honest” election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for the third victory of French New Caledonian supporters following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence in 2018, 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, in the Elysée Palace, is expected to act as a result of this referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates favoured that the territory remain in France, since it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmur repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republicans of Valerie Pecres, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on the Macedonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the president added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire to make the choice of Caledonians a choice of France”.

5.2 Magnitude earthquake took place in the Kuril Islands area
The 5.2 Magnitude earthquake was near the island of Chicotan, Chicotan, in Chicotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicentre was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the town of North Kurilsk.
The old man's got a depth of 92.5 kilometers.
Earlier, seismologists had recorded an earthquake of 7.5 Magnitude in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create the ANKA-type rocket unmanned aircraft (BPLA).
On 11 December, the present adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arestović, reported.
That is, they can act against aircraft, against other drones.
Even against the air force piloted.
There will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft, the hull and the like," says Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA's equipment, Arestovic explained that they were jets rather than sprayed BPLAs.
According to him, it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar that outnumber him by all characteristics.
The first batch of BPLA is to be manufactured at the end of the following year, Arestovic concluded.
ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile facilities during the military operations of the Joint Force in Donbass.
On 6 December, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky reported that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun.
He said Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Samunma and the Ukrainian Mini-Defense concluded an agreement on the construction of a centre in Kiev to train staff, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
At the Singapore airport, Changi escaped the lions.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with a family of lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the lions running will lie down on the roof of the container.
The beasts couldn't get away from him because of the shielded net.
The opposition ended after the arrival of Mandai Wildlife Group staff of all Singapore Zoos.
They have immobilized the lions by means of wiretaps with a tranquilizer and are planning to take them to a quarantine facility.
Previously, in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion fled from his master and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not harmed.
Specialists warned of cancer threat due to vitamin B9
Studies have shown that excess B9 vitamins also known as folic acid can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who lack folic acid are less likely to have some cancers, particularly colorectal ones.
In contrast, however, the increase in cancer cells increases the dose required.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if it significantly deviates from that figure in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, must monitor the dosage and avoid milk and other food containing folic acid.
Rachel Fine, formerly a nutrition consultant, called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because, among other things, it is found in avocados, Fain recommended that men be more likely to have fruit after 50 years.
In Britain, about 75,000 people may die due to omicron strains by April.
The forecasts of British scientists show that the proliferation of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England may cause up to 75,000 people to die unless the restrictive measures of winter are tightened.
The Guardian reported on this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and referred to TASS.
According to the most optimistic prognosis of specialists who are part of the British Cabinet ' s scientific and advisory group on emergency situations, by April 2022 at least 25,000 deaths due to omicron strain are recorded in the country and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
Hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected daily at the peak of disease.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the omicron strains are more contagious than the delta option and existing vaccines are not able to eliminate infection”, said mathematician Rosen Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously informed that if the rate of proliferation of the Omicron press remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, omicron may be the dominant strain in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1898 cases of omicron-stamp infection have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been identified in recent days.
On 9 December, the head of British Minhivad Sajid Javad indicated that this figure could in reality already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superpowers has grown by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superahts this year and the orders for the following year are all record-breaking, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and to combat climate change.
In the world registry of vessels, the number of chartered yachts was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million and above will not decrease, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that this was not 20 years old in the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of being infected on land and prefer to avoid a pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working away and the negotiations are being conducted by zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the paper that the shipyards are accepting new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and super rich people could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the rich and call them decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of lack of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes is annoying in society, as elites do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for the super rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to do so in such money mobility.
In the meantime, only the number of super-yuts ordered and their characteristics are impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds a REV Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
It's going to be the biggest boat in the world after the water drop.
The yacht includes a “lunch basin” as well as a submarine designed to explore sea depths.
In the existing super-hunts, helicopters, open-air cinemas, and some of them, such as McGregor's fighter yacht, have become a single-circuit platform.In Indiana, Professor of Economic Anthropology of American University of Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas elections, the carbon footprint produced by super-rich is negligible.
But it is symbolic, given that the multibillionaires in the world are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is a thousand times greater than that of the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest contaminant of the world, Roman Abramovic, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail moved onto its Eclipse yacht of 162.5 metres.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and allow the team to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The superpowers have no sympathy for other people when, like the richest woman in Australia, Gene Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complains through YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call for marinas to be built for vessels of 50 metres lashes.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to bowel cancer is defined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express has written about this.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week was at an increased risk of developing oncology.
The likelihood of developing the disease is increasing with an increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, the risk of intestinal cancer in moderate male patients is higher than in female patients.
The exact reason for the development of this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, only noting that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more specifically, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't know how many four-footed pussies really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how animal intelligence will develop.
Although the vocabulary of a dog is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the Scientificert publication.
Dogs can't play chess or make poems, they don't understand politics, the economy and the arts, but they often manage to reprimand their masters.
Representatives of some species, according to experts, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are able to think logically, and they do not give in to a two - year - old child.

Ukraine Prepared for US-Russia Trade
The United States and Russia will “traffick” with regard to Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kočetkov stated in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were soon planning to continue negotiations on United States guarantees that Ukraine would not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something knowingly unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just going to send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, there is a trade", the analyst wrote.
Kjetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparation is carried out in secret, quickly and immediately into offensive action, rather than waiting for the faction to be discovered and deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
The leading Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway and Equipment Exhibition in 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said Hou Zjaoven.
High-speed trains running along the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure greater reliability and working capacity of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China’s speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd brought together the first two-storey high-speed power plants to export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
A test operation of the subway train developed by the company for Turkey began in November.
The train will be driven by a metropolis connecting Istanbul centre to the city airport.
The subway will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
“The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the most innovative industries and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Fan Yaoyan, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Development of International Trade Promotion Committee/CCSRMT.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment in the world market," said Fan Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of support tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaosian, the country is the first to electrify railways and operate on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological sciences, Semin Goloseikin, spoke to Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, to plan, and to reduce the level of abstract thought.
Discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, the expert said.
Glaseikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and brain atherosclerosis are the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
It is therefore necessary to start prevention in time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of development of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of various BADAs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Goloseikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular exercise of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement in memory and thinking logic”, said Goloseikin.
Earlier, the charity for dementia research in Britain stated that the disease was increasingly affecting people over 40 years of age.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first worrisome sign can be considered to be vision problems, which make the patient difficult to identify.
Another sign of the developing weakness was called aphasia - a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist required Saakashvili to be treated abroad
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a consortium of doctors set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading to his disease.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are stable," said the expert, noting that this is not a normative framework and that the ex-President must now be sent for special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia”, said Toidze, requiring Saakashvili to be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after he was disciplined by prison staff.
The Georgian policy was quickly able to abolish punishment and restore itself to earlier rights.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports were held
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory vaccination certificate from COVID-19 have been held, reports Europa Press.
In the capital city of Catalonia, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become compulsory to go to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many of the manifestos came into action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also require more than 50 persons to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants.
The protestors in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and over 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated persons in Russia.
Bills on a single QR-Code system were submitted by the Government to the State on 12 November.
It is expected that the Russians will be able to visit places of mass activity, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with either a certificate of vaccination or a transferable disease or a medical certificate of vaccination.
The same rules will be laid down for trains and aircraft.

Great lift: how Chinese become miners
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes of the country and help create international resorts
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will bring together President Si Jinping 1 trillion Yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of the remote provinces.
The Taivu mountain resort in Zhangzjakou, near the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, work on greening is carried out: workers plant trees.
There are over 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to accommodate international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangzjakou, there are problems with snow.
The main challenge for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers will become permanent.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Game adviser Justin Downs said that China's ski industry had changed to ignorance since its last visit in 2007.
In the winter, more Chinese are being sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to establish a mining culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and built upon the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
A 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, not far from the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, there was a speeding railway, and none of the locals were suffering without a job.
There is an increasing number of stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On slopes, there are commonwealth areas with national cuisine.
There's even a CAVID-19 testing station in Taiwan now.
China seeks to create a prosperous industry of winter sports, its athletes must be the leaders of the largest international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled the progress of mankind on universal access to health services, said the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published by WHO and BB on the International Day of Universal Health Care.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in medical care, caused undue stress in health systems.
In this regard, immunization for the first time in 10 years has decreased, and mortality has increased from tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has triggered “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people have become more difficult to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister has been shut down on "The Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan delivered a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Democracy Summit" in a video-free mode, showing the YouTube summit.
Reuters, referring to sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the map on which Taiwan was allocated was separate from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified as green as “free” and the PRC, the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenplay, noting that the views of the participants of the discussion “not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters point out that the map shown by the Taiwanese Minister may have been contrary to the one-China policy followed by Washington.
One source of the agency stated that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council had been angry with the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a country.
The Summit for Democracy organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of the New Paper, Dmitri Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be paid to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sovbez RF Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit was carried by “Anti-Russia and anti-Chinese charge”.

Write that they're "freaks, don't return money."
And that is how many children they have, and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather them together to hang them on your neck.
And if this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education so...

The Joint Mechanism for Prevention and Control of the National Council of the PRC issued a circular requiring increased prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where the land crossing points are located, with a view to further preventing the introduction of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, the people leaving these cities must provide a negative test result for the nucleic acids of COVID-19 received 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in the cities where the land crossings are located must pass at least one nuclear acid test to COVID-19 upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will apply from the date on which the relevant provincial administrative units determine and publish the urban areas until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land crossings are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the CAVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the MEI, it was reported that there was a “welcome conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
The members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with "Investigation", assessed Moscow and Washington's prospects for relations.
He noted that the long journey of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, and it's completely unpredictable in terms of any prospect of improving relationships.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have had with both the current administration and Trump, and Obama.
The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, problems are related to the US's desire to impose Russian approaches on multiple issues.
The MID header added that it would not risk providing optimistic forecasts of prospects for better relations and not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of Russia's MID, Sergei Lavrov, said at a meeting with US Secretary Anthony Blinken, that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned against the risk of being vaccinated by a nasal agent from CAVID outside hospitals
The Nasal Vaccines of COVID-19 may have allergies and may need medical assistance, so the first points to be applied should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virologist, RAN correspondent, bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
Organize nasal vaccine vaccination centres at airports and trade centres more easily, but I would only do that at first sight in health facilities.
The possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to a doctor’s office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that function in exactly a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netes said.
In the view of the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccinations at shopping centres when there is experience in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that it was important for the Nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
In addition, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the nasal implantation is absorbed after injection.

Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions if “aggressive action” against Ukraine continued, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country.
“There are restrictions on Russia and it is impossible not to suffer itself,” said the official representative of the Kremlin on television channel “Russia 1.
Peskov claims it's "understand the world."

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French TV channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results were cancelled at 2.99% of the newsletters.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low profile was due to the separatists ' call for the rejection of participation in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was already held in 2018 in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the founding of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live in the archipelago, with special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration in force in 1998, under which the region can vote twice twice on its independence.

WHO provisionally considers "mycron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally believes that Omicron is less dangerous than the delta strains of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a reduction in vaccine efficacy in the new variant of COVID-19.
As of 9 December, the omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and significantly altered antigen profile of omicron protein suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (the severity of the disease - order) may be less severe than “delta”, says WHO technical communication.
The Organization notes that so far, all recorded cases of omicron contamination in the EU are easily or immodestly.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is faster “delts”.
In Russia, two cases of omicron strain infection have been reported.
They “we were previously immunized”, the Gamaley Centre reported.
The head of the Rosebobnadzior, Anna Popov, stated that there was not yet reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest of them.

In Ukraine, four scenarios have been named for Zelensky
The Deputy High Council of Vadim Denisenko listed four options for developments for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without West support and might compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12th, Denisenko spoke in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option that Denisenko called the “ideal storm” implies that Ukraine would cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"The price of key goods, which we traditionally export, has been reduced in parallel, " internal protests and the opposition of power with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Red), " added the Ex-Parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation: “war against all”.
This forecast will be realized in the event of high turbulence in world policy, where Ukrainian authorities face a number of challenges.
As a result of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to internal opposition.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former nardep, is up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of the non-green groups and the President, which is likely to result in the capture of control over the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a crisis, Zelensky will begin “reforming power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the turn of Zelensky into “the father of the nation”.
This can be the result of an event that will be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to generate feedback from external partners and to increase support for Ukraine,” said Denisenko.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or Russian aggression, according to the Ex-Deputy.
The Russian side has, however, repeatedly rejected any likelihood of “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity within Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, sociological survey data from the Ratings group showed that the Ukrainian President's ratings fell to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This has been the lowest indicator since the election of his Head of State.
Analysts have projected a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine, only 21.8 per cent of the votes of Zelena would be cast, while 14.5 per cent of the country ' s ex-President, Petra Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3 per cent of all those interviewed expressed support for the President.

Arrested for action on Red Square, poet: "For the quote Evtushenko, 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
The student ALL was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrossia was written a large number of poems.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenia Evtushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the re-infringement of public action was drawn up for Alexander.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexey Navalno.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and it is unfortunately lost to the decline of a culture common in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the messaging of his messages.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What did the department say about your stock?
This time, the staff members were being adjusted, the detention was as polite as possible, as if that did not sound funny in some context of that word.
At Pushkinska they took the OMONovites and took the hard ones.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked at it if it was not acceptable, it was understandable.
Except for all four sides of the monkey, everything was very correct, but I knew what I was up to.
And if they start writing their poems after the action, at least a few people, I don't see what I'm doing for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private in the Thumba-Jumba language.
At public and official events, people speak the language so that everyone understands what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language of the translator.
It's a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian beautifully, but she's still using an interpreter.
Also at official events, there is a transcript of an old woman’s manual, and a stenographer is not required to know several languages.
You don't want a lot of words, so don't say it!

But that's not what keeps Americans in the U.S.
They are confident that the United States is better than anywhere.
That's how they grow them.

Researchers have described how potato helps to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients, which help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The roots contain group B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age violations.
Thanks to the large content of the cell, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and can also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis in regular use.
However, it is best for the best to digest or boil cornfruit, not to burn on butter.
The former edition of The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous to diabetics, as could other products with high glycaemic performance.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are rapidly diluted in sugar, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commersanta newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in personal support holdings and an increase in processing capacity.
Market participants believe that only imports will be replaced by a shortage of products at this time.

Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has a series "Univer. 10 Years Later" TNT TV channel (enters Gazprom Media).

"This Polish-designed idea" would mean that Poland only redesigned the idea in 1776, but developed it in a very effective way.
In fact, the slogan "Okraina - not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn't really change the point.
I watched her interview, the girl said she had the biggest dream of growing wings, that her dad would always rip it off.
Well, it's all very questionable.
So, what's next?
Light bulb Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide area, surrounded by light molecules, provides maximum uniform and bright illumination of the space.
A “nuclear” or “molecular” design that reflects the nature and nature of each object does not lose its relevance and allows us to place the emphasis in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the unwieldy of the design.
The thin, almost invisible cane, which is regulated by height, creates a feeling that the visor of vapor is in the air.
The metal gold armature and matte white miniaturine ceilings are easily complemented by any palette, and the pendant and bra presented in the collection will be a ready-made assembly to illuminate the living room, the bedroom and the visitor.
Well, taste and color, which is what it's called.
I really liked "Tarhuun," not the current one, of course.
Very delicious were the juices in the high glass cylinders.
Three servings of syrup, overwhelming, on my taste.
Two of them were in the first place.
Matrix Dimax Micro Ultimate, 160x190
The orthopaedic spring mattress Micro Ulmite.
The model is comfortable with two different surface softness, high stiffness and slightly higher meanness.
The product consists only of quality and premium chargers that have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: The centre of the model includes an independent spring block “micropackage”.
This means that the bedroom consists of 2,000 spirals, which work completely autonomously.
It's what they do that gives a unique spot.
Micropacket is the highest frequency of the multiplicity of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a strong orthopaedic effect and is considered a premium effect.
Fillers: from top and bottom of springs there are combinations of cohort layers and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there's a latex on one surface, there's a coconut coop on the other.
The filling tandem has long been classical since it transmits not only orthopaedic but also anatomical properties.
If the korra provides proper back support, the latex provides an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Chechol: The model is supplied in Aloe Vera's lacquer.
At the customer's request, it can be made both discounted and stationary.
Total height – 27 cm, recommended bed load – 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: guarantee period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full security and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has the certiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday's “Actual Chamber”.
The objective of the five-year mission is to assess the suitability of the Venus clouds and then to find life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, the Venus cloud near Earth has been assumed to be too acidic to live there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of an earthly kind.
A sample from Venus must arrive during the third mission.
Suppose that if we find life there, the basic question will be whether it is earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be evident that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If different, life on Earth may be more likely," said the leader of the Estonian team, "Venus Life Finder" Mikkel Paiusal.

Targets change Russian business
The theme of the Metians became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had been transformed into Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Thus, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-ministerials and their subsequent monetaryization.
Targeted people are worth considering as continuing objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic is that people are tired of disunity and limitations.
On the other hand, business is driven by the desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
Since the third, they have been a logical continuation of the digitalization trend of assets when any rights, securities, works of art and even money have become digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat and bad.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday and a traditional olive tree and a peasant under the coat, but no one's making me eat anything right now.
You can eat on the bed, try it, and that's it.
For ten weekends ahead of us, we can prepare any delicious and useful dishes.

And those who have not just been involved in sports or who cannot represent all the circles of hell that have passed, do not engage in judgment.
British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he believed that such attempts would result in failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be filled with unpredictableness and any trend may change.
The most important factor is the coronary pandemic and second, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price rise was temporary or not.
According to the expert, it was clear before the pandemic that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and it is time to return to relations where inflation-based interest rates would correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of excessive economic policy could lead to a new surge in inflation, in the opinion of some experts.
Furthermore, the issue of productivity growth, as well as the rise in poverty and climate change, was summarized by O'Neill.
Previously, the head of the Global Investments Division, Mikhail Shulgin, reported that the positive expectations for the $2022 course remain, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin referred to the monetary policy of the FRF, the dynamic of oil prices and the fears of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Coerced to agree.
But there is one thing: If you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago containers were smaller.

Russia has allocated about 4.5 per cent of GDP to auto dealers
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion, 784 billion roubles on new vehicles, 28 per cent more than during the same period last year, the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI) show.
In order to understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last September that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia runs the Russian market on income.
During the 10 months of this year, he managed to implement 325.7 billion roubles, which is almost 24 per cent higher than the year before.
The related Kia brand ' s Hyundai grew even more than 35 per cent, and the profits from the sale of cars were estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand increased by almost 21 per cent in the Hyundai region, to 1.94 million roubles, with Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz alone.
However, sales from Korean brands did not increase so much: according to statistics of the Automobiles Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia, in quantitative terms, realized 9.4 per cent more vehicles during the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
It closes the three leaders in cash sales of Japan's Toyota - the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on the cars of the brand in 10 months, 14 per cent more than the year before.
The Japanese were followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium (37 per cent) and the average vehicle price (28 per cent, up to 8.2 million roubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price -- more than the BMW -- from here and a bigger increase in financial capacity," explained the director of NIPI, Tatiana Arabaji.
At the rate of growth sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada on income growth shows the average market rate (plus 28 per cent) and the Russian cars spent 229.4 billion rubles on the cars of the brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year ' s financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan in particular.
WAZ, and less than 10 months later, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on non-roaders and pickups of the brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and disruptions in the production of all the world's automobiles, the automobile companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the value of Lada models seven times a year, the latest journey (8-10 thousand roubles) occurred in late November.
Prices for their products and other auto-producers are regularly copied.
The volume of Russia's car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire for car concerts to win past losses are seen by experts.
In the face of car shortages, I think that many car concerts have even partly been able to shift to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not place at the cost of cars before,
says WTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
In financial terms, I think the auto-producers are feeling very good right now, supporting the high marginality of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the value of cars observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow in quantitative terms, and in cash, but mainly through the inflation and complexity of the construction of the cars themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With increasing supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the car costs are slowed down, the car manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the volumes, notes the independent consultant for the Sergey Burghaziev Motorway.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, auto-producers are now seeking the greatest profit from each vehicle sold, notes Burgas. -
The increase in car production is not expected for the next six months, and in Russia, it is further fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation in the market, cars have proved to be a good investment facility - a car purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more cost-effective, the expert notes.
Biden advocated the transfer of the United States military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American soldiers to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
This statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
“No such plans have ever been made”, said the head of the White House, responding to the journalist's question about whether the United States had renounced such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation escalated around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally for the defence of Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 -- all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman, stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow sees the problem of the fighting of Kiev by the Turkish drones and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

A moderately rigid bedroom is more relevant for those in need of a "decommission" of the back and a healthy sediment.
The matras will be perfect for both the individual and the family.
The latter will especially assess the existence of a stable surface and the lack of “fire” effect when fluctuations on one side of the mattress can be passed on to the opposite, disturbing person in his sleep.

If this number is called a fraud, like an MPI employee or another force structure, it is not effective to drop it immediately, and it is likely that it will not succeed in putting it on the blacklist.
Because, in order to confirm his lie about involvement with the force structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and coax.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's bullshit.
I don't believe it was like that.
They don't know who to blame anymore.
They got to the Queen.
And most of all, they think it's everyone's fault, except the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people in peace from coercion, of course if our people cared for their own people.

I can even smile at you.

A student film by Alexander Sokurov received European Oscar for best installation
Oscar-nominated Russian film "Ruzimayka Kulaki" won the European Film Academy Award (also called "European Oscar") in the nomination of "Lush installation", says "Moscow Komsomolec".
The jury, who voted online because of the difficult epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding skills of film makers.
The maximum award this time was "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main heroine of the tape is an interpreter for a United Nations mission who is trying to save his family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As to the drama “The Stirred fists” by Kira Kovalenko (Alexander Sokurov’s graduate), the film tells of the complex relationships of a powerful father and who wish to be freed from the fatherly care of an adult child in North Ossetia.
Previously, it was announced that this film was nominated for the Oscar film as the best film in the foreign language.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, have shown, I think, are not on the subject.
Only yesterday did the President of Azerbaijan approve the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ company.
