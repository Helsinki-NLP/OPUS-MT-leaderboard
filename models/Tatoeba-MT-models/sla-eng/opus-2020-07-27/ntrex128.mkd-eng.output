Members of the Wells National Assembly are concerned that they "look like maps"
Some members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal that their name change in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a laughingstock.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "he rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh, Welsh twp means "crazy" and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said the party in its entirety "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said works his party is "free-minded" for the change of name, but noted that the similarity of the words MPP and the "mappet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision of any words that will name members of the congregation will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
Wells’s government law of 2017 gave Wells the power to change his name.
In June, the commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals suggesting a great deal of support for naming the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but the MPP option has received the greatest support from the public consultation.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but fighting to achieve consensus can cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was put to an effort to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is the right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's EU and NATO bids.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for a change of name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say a change of name is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO entry.
The bells of St. Martin shone as the churches in Harlem faced problems
" Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socialising in another way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started."
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings filled with people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore the day will speed up when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built from white people's assemblies before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original church of white Methodists moved out in the '30s.
The congregation of blacks practicing their faith near takes possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of salesmen on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in 1939, but since the members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the poor rang".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the unprofessional leaders of the church, and part of the bishop's diocese.
The church board -- the church's governing body, composed of unprofessional leaders -- wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will require the costs" to be transferred to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old diver for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, the authorized organs said.
The attack took place seven hours ago near Beacon Beach in Enzinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help him get out of the water.
Hamel declared that at first he thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then “found out that he was shouting, ‘ He bit me!
He bit me! ”
The whole key bone was visible to him," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I scolded everyone to come out of the water: 'There was a shark in the water!' Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to San Diego's Children's Hospital. He's been seduced as if in a critical condition.
You don't know what kind of shark the shark was responsible for the attack.
Beach rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but decided the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorized authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gils noticed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are entering the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of commodity houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as the fashion and household sales decline, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and will be presented in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once designed for televisions, microwave ovens, and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said they would for the first time double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
Existing L'Oreal brands, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of makeup Boutique, so that most products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, the first of which opened in Creidon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and a tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more and more like commodity houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos' stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat shops after buying both chains two years ago, which they say increased the sale of groceries and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and farm departments ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after a disagreement on how to split profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations mean that we are now a compulsory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound deal.
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11m contract with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The two's business is connected to the Goop brand of Guinean Paltrow.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning programme told Instagram she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Dan, withdrawing from their profitable life-style business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a television gold girl admitted during a tight meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant that she no longer had time to devote to their brand Truly for goods and household accessories.
Business is tied to the Goop brand of Guinette Paltrow, and it was said it would double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain in one of his cottages.
One source stated: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would send her away in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them absolutely off guard.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
In Marlowe's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this leader of the morning program, one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the company millions due to large investments in pillows and candlesticks, and clothing and household products and the potential for further postponement.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and husband of Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become ambassador to the brand for M&S and will replace Ant Mcpartlin as leader of "I'm A Celebrity" (I am the star) of ITV.
A source close to Jones yesterday said "We are not commenting on his business ventures."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting that some would consider "non-presidential" and because he was so positive for North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice disguised as "a news president".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation were postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Young Ho told world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States for North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his rally speech.
"We are very much in agreement with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results -- completed missile trials, helped free the hostages and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd ahead of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and led hundreds of lives
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no basic disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbun said.
While “Save the Children ” is a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that plague Indonesia all the time, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other shores.
The apparent lack of siren warning from the tsunami in Palo, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using machetes, varnishes, and arrows and other old weapons.

"I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 halfway after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.

The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into an earthquake of 7.5 that struck on Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, the spokesman of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was crammed by a shot from the demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old women were found at 7.55 with stab wounds to Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is in the initial phase, but I would ask the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially cab drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that matters about our investigation."
Police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead resident and was found in an facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and as police have said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry was allowed, no exit from the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants were now told that they would spend hours before they could go back.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps repeating “it’s so terrible. ”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the border, and one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact an anonymous crime fighter on 0800 555 111 citing a record of 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue of parliament has become the latest memory blow in the fight of "resigning history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his “Taliban” destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "a bypass to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure at the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclust of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the deeds of his forefather, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's wonderful presentation of Ser William Hamo Tornecroft is proof of 19th - century opinion and of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is the defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate performance is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer tore apart and killed a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with a bloodlined artery wrapped near the Liupangsui market in Gitsow Province, South China, Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door to the nearby pig cocoon.
He said that there was a big boar in the cabin with the blood on his face.
Forensics confirmed that the boar weighed 550 pounds tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn apart," said the cousin, named "Wu", according to the quote in the evening news of Guyana.
The security camera footage showed Juan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
Market manager told evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Juan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “activator”.
"They're just playing."
They want to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds from 85 mph, a 1st of 5 p.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression begins over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa nears the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm begins to bring great tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching tropical humidity will create heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, the flow of ruins and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause rains that will be in some places approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid floods are caused by rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Especially is it recommended not to walk in the desert when it comes to tropical rain.
The pouring rain may cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rain to areas off the coast of Southern California.
Rains from more than half an inch [over half an inch] may be possible, causing rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasional rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early on Monday morning, before the rain will spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
The occasional rain will spread to the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes in the United States are expected due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast indicates the possibility of extreme temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blassy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the hopeless political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted the regular turnaround programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, drafted an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the indictments.
Ford told the Senate court committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was taking her drunk and trying to strip her of her high school clothes.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said that he was 100% sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw it on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look in offices.
To make it better, it's an audience with a size similar to the playoff competition in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked the appointment of Kavanaugh, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest stayed high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being reprimanded, and it was all being broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if there was an agreement with the FBI to review charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and with a few senators after that, Flake made a decision.
The election of Flake had great meaning, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on the issue of borgsity
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Braggsit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the borrowing costs is "totally absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: police arrest suspect Dion Simson for the death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
The twenty-year-old Ditéon Simpson has been arrested and detained for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the WAFB partner of CBS.
After being questioned by Simpson, the police said that he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The medical examiner's office in East Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The Department thanks the Louisiana state police refugee unit, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for her "activities in the search for justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot bacon grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" since Simms died.
"This is what you worry about constantly," the coach said.
Volcano Dumps Ashes on Mexico City
The ash ejection from Mount Popocatepetl reached the southern settlements of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans Sunday not to go to the volcano after the crater activity began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was followed by more beatings and shakes.
Images of social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s settlements, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increased activity on the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protestors clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used batons to suppress fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted "No oblivion, no forgiveness," and on the other hand union protestors shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid marked the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority voted in favour of independence, although the exit was low due to the boycott by people against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop the vote in polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations of support for national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they had won a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties were struggling to keep the momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-elected persecution or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, filming a police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's becoming all positive," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, said he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

The incident took place in Balinagard Kresent on Thursday at about 7.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said there was damage to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, it could be shot with an arrow from a crossbow to a car.
Menga’s hit brought victory to Livingstone 1 - 0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured victory
The Advanced Livingstone has stamped the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant as Gary Holde's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side was without guests in the season's victory and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are behind with eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna in Europe's League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unbeatable in the division in six games, and Coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingstone missed his chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was dragging the attack around the goal, and then Alan Littov could only direct his efforts away from there after he skated on the head of Craig Halkett over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing they could create problems with their actions.
And that's how the crucial goal came.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who with only a touch gave a goal from the center of the hexadecimal.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but they couldn't breach the host's defense, so Holman Liam Kelly didn't play most of the time.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of the Rangers' goalkeeper, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another action by Livingstone.
The Sixteenth of Livingstone was constantly passing and was repeatedly defended, while two demands for a penalty – following Halkett's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game – were rejected.
"Fremenal" by Livingstone – Analysis
Alasder Lamont on BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was remarkable, managing a super-organised defense, but Menga still had Connor Goldson and Joe Voral standing by.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they were able to open the hosts – and that is a small awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also said, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protestors portray the visitor's division as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident on the way to Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A biker died after a car accident in London.
The clash took place near the intersection of Bestoad and Evelyn Street, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and came to the emergency room, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place months after another cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police officers injured in riots
Six police officers were injured in riots in a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin in Worcester at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Specials from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
Cops are being treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were directed to deal with the ongoing incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but this is likely to occur early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwestern region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible sudden floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, to south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the work of Mongolia of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rockies and the Great Bassen, will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside risk areas for sudden floods, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to benefit because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Sushi Tracking Authority, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," the weather.com said.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over the peninsula of Lower California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with wind speeds of 85 miles an hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with the cool waters in the Pacific and is shrinking.
Thus, rains are expected in Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain," the weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up over Arizona and in southern Utah until late evenings Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is the very heavy rains in Lower California, Southwest Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and torrents of ruins, as well as landslide in mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder since a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace at Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police are asking if anyone has footage of a cell phone from the incident, to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's most brutal and scandalous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassy Ford's accusations that he had committed sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the significance of the Republicans' turnout in the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
I do not run, but I really fight," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, the senior head of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and total casualties increased
At least 384 people were killed, many were driven away by huge waves hitting the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of 6m (18 feet) hit the coast of the sunset, leading many to a safe death and destroying everything in their path.
After an earthquake of 7.5, a tsunami struck.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still performing their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for mediation in Indonesia's disaster briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, towing cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, narrow coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundance" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the shell of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Donggal, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in an announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that Tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came about the same time as the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared by social media can hear a man on the top floors of a building shouting madly, warning people down the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water plunges into the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power cut-off that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the evacuated people still desperately needed food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened just for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had plans to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While the staff of World Vision of Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge in shelters from their offices' gardens, they passed through the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's too bad.
Even as relief groups began their dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from travelling to Palo.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start coming if the crash site is declared a zone of national disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulija Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status".
As the second night fell in Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be miracles that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the sack for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian state paraglidering team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, when she began circulating news about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragladeers, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a gray sign of stilting, rather than with a son.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport Key.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an employee at Brink's who added an ATM to Newport's Kay, according to a press release at Newport Police Station.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "took from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses observed more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information on their identities should contact Newport P.D. at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kanje West changed his name to Yea.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote, "The creature formerly known as Kanje West".
Forty - one - year - old West wore her nickname for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to cancel "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Although using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'her' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Which means I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Kanye, which means only Jei, reflecting our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Broder Love.
West’s former associate, Jay Zee, also uses his name with or without a dash and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico's VD President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were ingrained in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly help to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the research funds in the field, the investor and practitioner for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will be made by the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melon worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranking American hijacker, and later served as director in Microsoft Research and president of Google in China.
Li thanked for previous matches following the technology of the United States government as the challenge in robotics of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in Defence and asked when the next match would be in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to obtain state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that took academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that "green cards" should be automatically offered to doctors of artificial intelligence sciences," he said.
The National Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of a Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions similarly to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organisations spend money on researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover industry and academy partners, and the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence authority committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation demanding the creation of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence had been ineffective for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims its northern neighbour's name is the right to its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts as to whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum's validity.
The referendum voter's question was: "You have given in to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to enable entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjoorgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 1300 hours.
However, the exit stood at 16%, compared to 34% in last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The poll, released by Macedonia's Institute of Political Research last Monday, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Thelma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the exit should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's politics since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed Brighton's entire goal defense
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton’s defense in the 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received mid-field feed at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between Brayton's three defense players before entering the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four "greens".
Walking around a defensive player before running a few others on the edge of Brighton’s hexadecimal.
He then handed it left of him, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first approach to the hexadecimal to return the Aguero ball, which with his right leg defeated Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with the only blow to the right of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 – 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you scored that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a lovely direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched it several times before he led Sterling to the distant article.
The attack of "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hofenheim in a 1255 championship league match in the Rhine-Neckar arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play Spoiler against Rokis
Since Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rokis, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rokis team, which lead with a match ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rokis’s team had at least a "joker" for a five - to two win over Nationals on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can throw out knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still need to announce a starter for a week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw him into such a situation.
Shercer, who will start after 34th time, trained to throw on Thursday and will throw out the usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand man is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-out points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Mitinzi for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' exit in the early elections.
"All we have done so far will be placed on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I really fight, so I'm all over fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of democracies, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, by seeing wickedness, by being rude.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrathful, evil, rude and untruthful".
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the Order of Democrats, appointed by the Senate Judicial Committee, by the name of which the audience responded with calls of dissatisfaction.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, what?
No, and no, I wait a minute -- it was a very bad speech on the body -- the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
Labists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the ranks of members of parliament from the Labist Party to whom we are told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow Parliamentary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of a meeting of the East Lab Party of Nottingham said "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party Parliament, the council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “mild, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is being judged whether it is acceptable for party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues with whom I thought we had shared a similar political opinion had begun to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would otherwise never have taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there is a critical harassment of social media that calls for condemnation, denial of central politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the lab.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have a great awe for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for "no trust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more closely opinionated.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “everything will be fine. ”
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the lab party as a student, provoked by thatcher's negligent government that literally left my classroom collapsed, I fought to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday's demand, all I want to say is that when the country is going to power Braggsit to harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the lab.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how many condemnation threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeatable Ear Tops
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderful entertainment competition on the day of the Scottish Football Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it is all due to their superior defenses, as well as their improved opportunities, which the home team has carried, and Coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Praiseful of Ear, they used their chances better than us. ”
The point of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was given for the game of Warriors, allowed Melrose to improve his numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Air’s leadership with a penalty before, right in half, he scored a point, and converted a solo point to achieve 17 - 5 for Air during rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by the Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, who had been brought to the stretchers, and from the re-emergence, Ear continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDowal, converted by Klimo.
Air's VD, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged an extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team has recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson has received a yellow card to knock down Klimo without the ball, McFerson is extracting a touchdown from the penalty line at the back of the sharp attack on Air.
Klimo converted, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Roe took David Armstrong's shot and sent Gregor Henry's wing player to the fifth point for the home team.
The Still Game star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Steel Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready to move to the catering industry after it was discovered that it was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, where he's a screenwriter and plays together with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphyll.
Duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last, and it looks like Kiernan is planning for life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kirnan was trying to engage in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a disguised-lying naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have placed a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are glued to the motto: “Our sea is right.
It's our duty to have him back."
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again after the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the largest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course it expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit, which Chile is obliged to negotiate decades later for a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here is Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends quite heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said solemnly in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge Bolivia in favour and that it will not change much even to judge them.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to allocate Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, she may have been reprimanded by Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarat said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not been exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Kalsadiya also rejected Morales, another of Latin American’s most popular presidents, as a political support for the sea.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is a "fiction" to believe that the continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declared end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang first to take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and United States President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris’s fashion reviews reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the largest shops near you
If you want to improve the size of your cap collection or completely block the sun, then do not look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of freaky big hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
The most impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent out their eyes-falling designs after the runway.
The piece pointed out by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide stitch of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other large supplements included watermelons with zirconium, magic hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a full-blown diver with glasses and a diving pipe, and the other looked like a melted corset of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that giant hats can come to shops near you.
Too large hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide two-foot knife carried by everyone from Rijana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation after the track, a straw beach bag almost equal to the height of the model it dragged.
A dark orange Rafi bag, with a borduro of a Rafi and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the collection of La Riviera SS19 by Jacquemus on the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Stylist of the Famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results of exams, which only strengthens the individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, a career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an election subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will make him haughty.
If you talk to him in his language, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages surpass all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students learning foreign languages achieved a higher "5+" rating.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher "5+" mark in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an electoral subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the OC Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 noted that due to employers' failure to fill jobs, 17 per cent were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs seeking languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such life skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polycarbonate an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of the people.
So investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the OK when they are looked at in the future by 2020, like Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages he can choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be illustrated in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
“Il faut bien le faire” (this must be done).
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will take the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James launch for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James is going to play in the first preseason game Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But as many minutes go by, it's not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
A reporter for the Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in preseason at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of myths as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump's scheduled mitts next week, including visits to favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is in peace, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because Republicans can lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Coast Hour Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia on the internet with live broadcasts on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will refer to the hearing of a man nominated for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, with an expected postponement of the Senate vote by one week, while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
The primary goal of the Mitinzi series is to help Republicans get a swing at the November elections.
Hence, President Trump's campaign said these five mitts next week are aimed at "incentivising volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of the congress is so important in its agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible with the start of a tough campaign season," said Trump's campaign spokesman for Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
Ordered in the Wesbanko arena in Willing, tonight's rally can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday is the second visit to Trump of West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisei, who is lagging behind on the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisei that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Coop Ryder 2018: US team shows courage in fighting to keep the hopes alive at Sunday's start of individual matches
After three one - sided seasons, the four Saturday afternoons may have been exactly what Coop Ryder needed.
The reversal of happiness is a completely fabricated sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
To whom would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're a little lucky I guess," said Jordan Spit after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of leading four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails, although they have enough incentive, if anything else, then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Spit was excellent and exemplary.
Those strong shouts of celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the leveling of four or four when he and Thomas had two missments after two rounds.
His kick at the 15th game was greeted with a similar shout, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to dig deep and take care of your match," Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to score point.
The only players with multiple points from Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of Cup Ryder.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot be wronged.
"Mollywood" was the only couple without bad strikes Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad strikes Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine Friday morning.
That series and the way it seems to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will ensure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, other than Flitwood or Molinari.
It's preferable both at the same time in different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unjustified.
Beetle Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he joined up with Alex Norén.
A failure and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Two couples and fours are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not follow, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the season of four also showed that the US team can fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of Buy Ryder
Europe will enter with a solid advantage on the last day of Cup Ryder after Saturday's leading in double pairs and fours of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duel of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead until now on Le Golf Nasional on four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which fought to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to score four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair in general, which won four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After they "crushed" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and US rookie Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced score of 5-4.
Woods, which ran through two swords on Saturday, played well at times, but now lost 19 out of 29 games in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the 2-1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copa - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time top winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point measure for Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2-1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double pairs and later returned to defeat Pulter and Rory McLroy with 4-3 in fours, but lost two holes at the beginning.
Only twice in the history of Cup Ryder a team has recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as title bearers, Furic’s team has had enough equal scores to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the weekly counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepen confidence in the United States and that there is no way the country will give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantled nuclear testing plants and committed itself against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament "in a phase", according to which North Korea would gradually be rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree suggested a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to working towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump gave security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refuses to give in to severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel us is a delusional dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a dead end."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the U.S. land was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketar" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened "total destruction" of North Korea last year, much more than praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "It takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exception until complete, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied North Korea only a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon this month to disarm the missile plant, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing cat-culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
One researcher discovered that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about themselves.
Charles Chaisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the lecture a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic results and improve the overall well-being.
Paul Barera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a dormitory where students press on coffee glasses, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how inadequate sleep affects athletic results and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Cheeseler added.
The culture of pride with "working all night" still exists, he said, and in addition modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm on when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal brought down Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's coup sent Stephen Gerard's top team to defeat 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to register its first victory after the February 4-1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team put the second defeat of Gerard's 18-game team as the manager who left his team with eight points behind the stray lead team Harts in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the halftime, and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and chance of alignment.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingstone has climbed to the third and is only behind the Hibernian according to the difference in the heads.
There may be additional problems that the Rangers are facing since line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from a distance.
Gérard made eight changes to the team that Air passed in the Cupette Betfred semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingstone who won points with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well-trained setup choked opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the property over the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after Menga's first game went through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle row player missed his chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgo could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get the penalty in the 15th minute he and Stephen Lawles collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots at the goal in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly did not struggle with the headshot of Lasana Kulibali and Ovi Edaria's weak blow.
Although the beginning of Livingstone's 34th minute may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, who with a cold head chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerard reacted halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from her blockade line.
But Livingstone was able to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgo and Hackett catching a lot of long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor got on well and stopped Jacobs before Litgo played with his head on the horn.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson once again approved us.
Almanah: Geiger counter Inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday of the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DROVE ... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become the main stronghold of science, the gaiger counter has become the main stronghold and popular culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bell of Colorado", which features these seemingly unconvincing, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that? ”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release radiation into the minerals."
Evans: "Say, that must be jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” the alien cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” the alien cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells as part of the treatment
The method includes the extraction of patient immune cells and their changes in the laboratory
You can “see ” protein honor in many cancers and then be reinstated into the body
The test vaccine yields promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells, ovarium cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honor in many cancers called HER2 and then return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the US National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several cancers", including breast cancer, ovarium, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immunological cells from patients and their "learning" to target cancer cells works when treating certain types of leukemia.
Canje West made a pro-Trump drop, wearing a drop with his motto, after performing on Saturday night in person.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was spotted in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance praised by US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Ghosts, in which he wore a drop with an inscription to make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday's live night show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal committee on sexual assault charges against Christine Blacy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear that Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time getting behind the stage because of his cap.
"Behind the stage, they made fun of me.
They said, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sinking place, he said, according to Washington Exzeminer.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken place?" said he would "put his superman hat on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments attracted disdains from the audience at least twice, and the team on the evening show seemed ashamed, Varajeti reported, a man told the publisher: “The whole studio is occupied.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
The news surprised many with the performance of the song “I Love It, ” dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the TPSAD conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for rejecting the crowd."
But the host of the Karen Hunter show wrote on Twitter that West "was herself and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art" which I believe is accepting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, with him now "formally known as Keyne West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, also known as Puff Santa, Puff, and P Didi.
Comrade Rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist of the formerly known Prince.
Charge of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder since he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before a senior court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star in the Tronov series, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic Tron Game series.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho hero stereotype when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking about the Sunday Times cultural section, Keith said he believes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the toxic manhood problem in the #Now I say.
Keith, who recently married the Tron's Game star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted that he had "strong feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we do wrong with manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What do you learn from TV and what on the street makes young boys feel that they have to have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuations of the Tronov Game when the series ended next summer, saying he "completed battles and horses".
Since November, Keith has been performing in the reconstruction of the Real West of Sam Shephard, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that came out of the Trons game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me my future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing Igrit, a guy who had a love affair with Keith, John Snow, in a fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The two are married in June 2018 to Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/CID: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new events have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000.
Translating HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people of the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data from a member of staff associated with a senator of the Republican Party as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters dropped allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information to three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims are on ultra-right sympathizers and websites.
"Leads, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The reported information reportedly includes US Senators Lindsay Graham's home addresses and phone numbers from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel of hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court Judge.
The information provided appeared shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstein announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information about a Waters staff member has been published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those untrue and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information presented.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flysher.
"These denials are nervous," Fleisher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats associated with Judge Kavanaugh, who was indicted by critics because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also tweeted.
"If true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office informed "the competent institutions and police of the false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
Thinking about Johnny English Attacks Again - undermines Rowan Atkinson's espionage scams
Now it's traditional to look for elements of Braghsit in every new British relationship movie, and that seems to be true for this re-establishment of the cheating, action comedy Johnny English -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Is the careful ridicule of the subject of how clearly we are in trouble would be the new export opportunity the nation has?
Despite all that, the face with big eyes and a lot of makeup on the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "roast" things the second time -- his name above all means that he was a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where no English is spoken.
He's certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamour a little bit like Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bin and part of the boy who plays a note from the song of Kochii on the fire from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten TV commercial of Barclays, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor, and the rotor's fins hit on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor looks weak and somewhat superficial, especially because the "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission contain the elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be meant for children, rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy mishap isn't as inventive and focused as you don't have Bin's feelings on Atkinson's character.
The topic that's been going on all along is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British field agents, to the disappointment of an officer on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and fighting figure and is already suffering from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best in this quasi-Tereza-May character, but there is nothing special about the scenario that would be done.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling on Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in private school, but "black" gives secret agents lessons: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school of spying that resembles a rock academy.
English is quickly called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Beau, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comical role that Vicki Pepperdin is not well used in.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all the stuff in the Royal Secret Service, they go back into action and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, the guy from Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the vicious Jason Walta, played out by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they cause desolation after they smuggle themselves on Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the inside of Volta's house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as he is, there's a lot of baby TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry play a role for Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Labists deny they're planning for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin will consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week -- but they will be poor paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they'd take the same pay.
According to sources, the idea is "corresponding" to the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be favored by workers.
The four-day working week shift is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A highly ranked party member told Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a quest consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during a campaign for parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, aspirations are not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "The four-day working week is not a party's strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of "directors without a face" and "profits" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" for unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the boards of companies and to create Inclusive Property Funds, allowing 10 per cent of private company capital to belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, making a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could reconsider
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has updated the question as to whether the bureau's findings can change the minds of some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, looks like it's been carved into stone.
"My decision is made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graem added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"All her names could not be confirmed.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen festival, and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants have to perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful deed that will help raise awareness for their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbalen Citizen because he has 12 years left to accomplish the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert the real way to convince people to ask for something or just one more case of "click-activism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing petitions on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, which have acted for many different purposes.
They say that these activities have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and strategies that have raised more than 37 billion dollars and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children to exploit their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with insufficient food in the country after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Nutrition said in front of the assembled people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls for improving the feeding of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the power of Ishranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions at their website "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — we will never make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, whose host will be Deborah-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russia's energy exports - the interior ministry
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, quoted Washington Exeminer as saying.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea roads remain open and if a blockade is necessary to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed the event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is an effective one.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while Russia was talking about a "one inconvenient pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement followed after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to deviate from the "inappropriate" project for the Northern Tek 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Peri in Moscow in September.
The American stand came amid resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our supply of energy," Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, a senator from Massachusetts said
Masacousec Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means a woman on her forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether I should run for president."
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he "led the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to her criticism of Trump and the man he nominees to judge the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that many voters in its constituency think that it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "probable" voters from Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Centre for Political Research at Safolk/Boston Globes University.
Thirty-two percent support such a bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names from the democratic party discussed on the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Trek Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally.
Trek Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested, charged in an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I know how other families feel about being torn apart because of post-straumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning to," she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "they return a little different, they return solid, they return and wonder whether there is respect for what they and their airmen have given to the country, and every other member of the military has given it to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assault by a female, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Vasila.
18 federal states, Washington backs the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges politics, Ann-Bi-Si News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union submitted against federal policy in August, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a number of asylum demands in the United States have emerged, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the 2014 Immigration Board's decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Public defender of the city of Washington, Washington, Karl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "disappoints decades from the adoption of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Moreover, advocates in the letter argue that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour".
Public defender Jeff Sessins ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is an asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Seshns said in presenting policy on June 11th.
Asylum has never been designed as a solution to all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are made in Palo because the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she was comforting her male baby at the evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Residents return to their devastated homes and choose from their irrigated objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came into his eyes when he described the severe earthquake in the fifth - floor hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "treatment" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the US daily listing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's paid allowance in De Moin Register -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US elections for the November 6 congress, China dropped the indictment.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign against China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotions, Beijing and Washington, they are currently at a commercial war in which they align import tariffs with each other.
China's payoffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "now redoubles the harassment of propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"In the elimination of propaganda, China's government abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by posting advertisements in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the near newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not really see the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's strong hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most read newspapers rejected his bid to publish" the column, although he did not say what newspaper it was about.
Republicans move away from women's voices before mid-term elections, due to a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are watching or defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination at the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
From such things there is no going back," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University at Syracuse University, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Reacher said he suspects the pressure on the FBI's investigation into Senator Jeff Flake (Republisher of Arizona) will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive MoveOn Group, said in front of Washington D.C. on Friday.
Friday morning, protestors shouted "November is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, said Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although not liking the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge candidate, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to news from En-Bi-Si.
"It's not just the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's also about the way Republicans handled it and treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps in choosing a democracy, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, although more than one accepts the first party.
A new Yu-Gove poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in the testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's legal committee, under oath, last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network, begins with a startup business that claims to be a Facebook rival, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrapt, is a company built on an open-source platform at the Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Internet Data Storage" or short-circuited POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Autluk, Sleek and Spotify to be all available to one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it "personal data strengthening".
Inrapt's idea, according to company executive director John Bruce, is to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, several development developers with a project contract and a volunteer coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available at the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a media release released Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the consortium of the World Technology Institute's World Network in Massachusetts.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A famous Victorian Cross Carrier Since World War I · Global Voices
The only Church of England priest to receive Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorable Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Belenglis and Lechaukur.
Yet, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never found out that he had received the highest British military medal.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandkids at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was "amazing symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quntin, "With very thick fog and heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places where he fired and with “the greatest courage ” led ahead, before attacking the cannon nest himself and impoverishing three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, nearly a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I will never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make him modest".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Youth Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor for him to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
The fans of combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead they got Pepa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Belator 206, and you don't have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with a key card showing live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., only Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, British viewers were appalled when the channel moved to Pepa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of fighting.
One of the Twitter fans described the transfer of children's cartoons as “a sick joke. ”
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of the Belator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Bird of a Pig," yes.
Company President Belator Scott Cooker said they would be working on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing again, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there's six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- to try to deliver more because of the fans, and we overreacted.
It's an accident.
Wild Island Discs: Tom Daley Felt "Inferior" over Sexuality · Global Voices
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "they're all not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first edition of Disks on a deserted island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular performer of the longtime Kirsti Young show took a months off for illness.
Appearing as a sidekick in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferior value and diversity were things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympics with two bronze medals became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used their performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar who was 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age," he went to the first Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Daley said "all his eyes" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was connected to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — Pride from Heather Small — that turned to his head in preparations for the Olympics and from which he still faltered.
Disks on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 is Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikkelson, the horse wasn't in shape, was on the bench during the Buy Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he'll have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Mikkelson, who played the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday double couples and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of attention, as the United States often represents, the five - time winner, he shared the time to cheer and practice his game in the range, hoping to correct what he is pushing.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight playground Le Golf Nasional, where the distant rough blows are a regular punishment in negligence.
And if the terrain itself is not frightening enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces British Open Francesco Molinari's precise champion, who is pairing with rookie Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans who miss four points before 12 individual matches start to struggle, the game of Michelangelo can be crucial.
Furic expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see otherwise.
"He fully understands the role he played today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and he's been given a lot for these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't picture him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went so, and we thought we had to do so.
He wants to play, like everybody else."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of the most played Cup Ryder matches on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furic said his presence brings something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he wants to joke with people and he's an excellent man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership over individual matches on the last day of Coop Ryder can easily be turned into an awkward position.
The Danish debuted at a game in Walderama in 1997, when a guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "crossed the goal line only with the noses", with the smallest lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had great leadership in Walderama; we had great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a bit," Bjorn said, figuratively, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with the leadership of 10-6 of Le Golf Nasional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This is not over as long as the competition lasts.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on that.
All the time, I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent's best players in the world."
Bjorn added, pleased with the results of his heavy golfers: “I don’t want to give premature scores on the issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Individual games are waiting for us tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all abilities as a golfer.
That's the message to send to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they did in couples, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furic himself was on both ends of the last day's change, because he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle competitions.
We set the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of confronting Rory McLroy first and facing the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter faced the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform in this way with the boys because I think we will cover everything," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German warship is delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Reinland-Falz, the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wytemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, calling for an army spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues after the delivery impeded the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wittenberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be a replacement for the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is the rarest maintenance - it should be possible for the newest frigates to be absent for up to two years from the domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power across the oceans -- will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, DiCate notes.
The Fregate with an unfortunate fate F125 reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Brom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important because Baden-Wittenberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades to the future.
Reinland-Falz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project -- including training the crew -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany's reduced naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem worsened over time because the old ships were withdrawn from service but were not provided for replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wytemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new property survey is being conducted in the Scottish mountainous regions to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help lead the protection activities in the future.
The study of scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano-Lillians, as well as brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in the Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
En-Each-Es personnel and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the bat species.
Then a map of dwellings will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser in En-Ti-Es, hopes to find out which areas of life are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
Such information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain the forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects beds and the loss of habitats.
Veterans and lights also pose risks, as well as sticky fly strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who cares about more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspection of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even establishes the first and only bat reserve in Scotland for the Trives estate in Damfries and Galovei, home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says that the property is ideal territory for them.
"This is where Triv has a great bat area," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He stresses that it is important to check that there are bats before renovations are carried out because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferel, a Scottish officer in the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo dropped rape charges, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "false news", adding that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker is charged with rape by an American woman named Catherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on live on Instagram of its 142 million followers, hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for accusations they called "an unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages due to "moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident under indictment took place in June 2009 in a holy hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 per cent" "good boy" but dropped below that "one per cent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to a deal without judicial participation because she was afraid of retaliation and was concerned that "she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says he now asks that the treaty be recast because he has traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer moved to Italy's Juventus giant with a 100m-euro deal.
Bregzit: Britain "will always regret" lost by car manufacturers · Global Voices
Britain "will always regret" if it lost the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Braggsit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-British told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a plant in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
Japan's car manufacturer said that the impact of the border delays in the Braggsit case without an agreement would cost jobs.
The plant in Bournaston -- manufactured by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain disembarks from the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, in Bournaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, would operate when leaving the EU without an agreement.
Be-Em-You, for example, says he'll close his mini-factory in Oxford a month after Braggsit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "time-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain left the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a cut-off of the border that the industry believes could lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day supply of inventory at the Derbeshire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will enable us not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 programme today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful logistic chain set."
Toyota could not tell how long production would have been halted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cavalis, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and has been a representative of the factory’s union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In the light of my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have put together a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Defender Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight on Brett Kavano's nomination as a judge at the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants, and potential violations of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby threaten Miller's independence, sparks rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein was considering carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with reports released last Monday he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was in the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict at the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI regarding the Kavanaugh lawsuits, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been established, could be held this week, and could be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things work out, and I always try to keep the press properly informed."
Some journalists contest the claim: Sanders has not been briefed on journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the reluctance of television journalists' "great influence", though he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great impact."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have considered those figures."
There will still be briefings, Saunders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it more often, and you are witnesses that we have done it constantly over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
Rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is the case with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the collected journalists.
Health Secretary in writing to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system in connection with fears related to Bregzit
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire for them to remain after Braggsit.
Jean Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of the resolved status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU to withdraw continued during the summer in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of non-agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciated the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and are useful to patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristión Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury
Christine Abercrombie, the defensive player (linebacker) of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury to the game's head on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, says Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury took place shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and was just strung on the ground," Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put it in a stretcher and took it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually took place.
Abekrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey in Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before leaving the game, which resulted in a total of 18 crashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to step up the government's efforts to improve the situation with the homeless.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to gather up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and causing difficulties for people who buy property for the first time to participate in this property purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high property prices that retain the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to correct the "phast situation of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give advice on how to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my premiere to the return of the British dream, or life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning a home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland said his "end ambition" is in the future to become the manager of Scotland's national club.
The Scottishman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently ranks third in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to "Light Stadium" after returning "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told Scottish "Sportsound" at BBC.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland constantly in the Hamptons with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity could be obtained only if I am successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardich, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Pojet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no distress knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think that I've achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he entered a career after working as an assistant to the chief at Dumberton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts training staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the third league dropout and returned "St. Mirren" to the edge of losing the championship title in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls taking over "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough of it, and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and in this role, I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life."

According to a study, the perfect time for beer is 5:30 a.m. Saturday
The summer heat wave led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but put greater pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA Business Consulting Services said when establishing these figures: “Suntime and longer than England’s expected participation at the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and restaurants declined significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June has worsened even more during July.
The pubs and bars in which mostly drinks are sold noticed a much greater increase compared to previous years than the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which mainly food was sold were also badly affected by the solar periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and the sale of food by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst on vacation and hospitality from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw in late April.
The weather and influence of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although the fall in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly striking in addition to the current pressures created by the costs.
A long warm summer could not come at a worse time for the owners of the places where food is mostly sold and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide much-needed rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the publication of new brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker" is the sales tracking device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom and collects and analyses data on the efficiency of the 47 operational groups with a combined income of over 9 billion pounds and represents a fixed rapper for the industry.
One out of five children has a secret social media profile that she hides from her parents.
One study showed that one out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has a secret social media profile that hides it from their parents and teachers.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News raises fears that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main ” profile to show their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, creates a social media profile that hides it from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid rise in the number of "false insta" profiles, a short cut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
News has increased the fear that sexual content is published on such profiles.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a refined "main" profile that they show their parents, while they also have other private profiles.
A mother who happened to find her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile came across a teenager who asks others to "rap him."
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the "Scottish Athletics" board.
Elid Doyle was elected executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Bitty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience acquired over the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and world athletic community have great respect for Elid, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a board member," Bitty said.
Doyle said, "I am ready to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help with the proper direction of sports in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to the total four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, which now appears regularly as a commentator of the BBC, could not go after having suffered a transient hechemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I was able to recover completely, and I can go back and practice for agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are likened to cows causes a division of opinions on the Internet
A company for the production of stem pumps has caused a division of opinions on the Internet when an advertisement was published comparing nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "the world's most powerful breast pump", the user-oriented technology company Elvie published a funny commercial inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who breast-feed.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay on a song whose lyrics sound like this: “Yes, I milk milk, but you don’t see the tail” and “If you haven’t noticed this isn’t a wash, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts. ”
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it highlights the "tremblings" of the dairy industry.
"It's a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, should become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they give birth," one comment said.
Elvie’s chest pump is discreetly incorporated into the breast breast (Elvie / ‘Mother’).
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who retain their babies?"
Someone else added, "It's really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really “smirkful. ”
"I think this idea is genius.
I would have bought a pump like this if I had still been breast-feeding.
Moaning made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I think she's being honest.
It is a genius product," one of the comments read.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial designed for mothers who milk milk (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This isn't a commercial that misses or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the pump of "Elvie" is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while milking the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and RDD in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves bold and provocative launch.
By setting up a parallel between women who are milking milk and dairy cows we wanted to milk milk with pump and the challenges that it entails to put in the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been present in all headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Yakubovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child migrants in custody has increased significantly even though the crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we continue to prosecute those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
With a view to handling cases with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules that would require some to appear in court within a month of being detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard has been voted.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to bring their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be immediately deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely it is to become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where because of its size there is a greater likelihood that signs of difficulties for the child are neglected.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends may increase the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria tells US, French, and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, though the war in the country has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately without setting conditions," he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people lost their lives since 2011, and millions were evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" that they are "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action would be directed towards jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members in order to draw up a posthumous constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem has established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution," and warned about the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump to win second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump will win the elections again in 2020 unless his presidential mandate has been suspended prematurely with impeachment and scandal, likely to be hoped for by a large part of the liberalists.
In what will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale in the presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the credit rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says that Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in the prime time, 1.7 million more compared to the four-year period, while "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news is reported.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survival" drama "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skovel, a veteran in writing comedy and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He replied, "Because I think he is really funny," Mrs. Skovel told me.
There's also a certain entertainment value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Disengaging all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been looking for six hours at a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a skinjacket bomber by Paul Manafort of $15,000 (“dressed with thick arrogance”, as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking descriptions of anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"It's part of what he does and what gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show that every night brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump's rotating team and day-to-day twists (carts with NFL, praises for Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in and watching "MSNBC" while recording "CNN".
He couldn't stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Justice Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was in critical condition.
"I remember that we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Inflow of foreign funds in the tightest mid-term elections in the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of the congressional areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh, Democratic Representative Conor Lamb is running for office in another field of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional area, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were modified after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old areas were manipulated in favour of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congress area is a difficult competition to finance campaigns among the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congress Committee for Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the extraordinary election for the 18th congressional area in Pennsylvania in March, characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area with a 20-point difference.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then gave up
The diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the State Department in a statement earlier this month.
But only in El Salvador were fines, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental effect on the country in Central America and on the high unemployment and killing rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward in an effective way to end any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens should address the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of severe messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal thinking on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration who also spoke of the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is the release of Special Adviser Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is currently well-established evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress's composition changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before the voters and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to take a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid years of subsequent massacres.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans now face a few such points of change.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot stool after this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly recording the president and speculating that he was unopposed for the function he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we act if Brett Kavanaugh's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles at the Sabbath table with a swastika logo.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of "Rangers" with an optimistic attitude in front of the conflict with "Rapid Vienna"
"Rangers" are hosts of the "Rapid Vienna" clash Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the winning unresolved game against "Villarreal" in Spain early this month, victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-order player for knee injury, was prevented from appearing during the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that the "Rangers" can use that result as a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We have entered the game believing that we can achieve something and come back with a winning point.
Perhaps we could have given a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably also a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
On Thursday, another big European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the fan support we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year with everything that happened, that is, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and make a success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by “Nationwide ” said that they had spoken to their marriage mates about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Company "Nationwide".
Here's where you're supposed to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your choices to finance long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover the costs or provide yourself with a self-sustaining insurance with your own resources, if you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out full-time health care so that you can empower a person with confidence to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the fullness of your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you were unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to a hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he is taking and his allergies?
Notice these details in writing in order to be ready.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot repeatedly with an air rifle on his way home from the exit.
The victim of about 40 years of age was found in Oxford Grove, Ilfracomb, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as "an act of chance."
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by severe earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers cannot obtain information from the Dongala district, a district north of Palu, nearer to the 7.5 - degree earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated.
Following a few key facts about Palo and Dongala on Sulavesi Island:
Palou is the capital of Central Sulavesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300km (180 miles) on the coastline in the northwestern part of Sulavesi Island.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's economy, Central Sulavesi, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency says Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also, tsunamis hit and hit Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26, causing tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees hit the southernmost part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached 10m and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake with shallow focus hit Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the earthquake caused no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, interfering in a report on family violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Matt-Su detention facility with a chance to exit if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he pleaded before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to $250,000 a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a B-class offense, I fined $2,000 a day in prison and a fine.
This is not the first time we've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaskan Veteran Court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the crime report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he supposedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying that her son's violent behavior stems from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck an area near Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Social media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu beach festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a terrorist suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that hasn't been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck on Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle path on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a report on the intention to request a death sentence delivered in the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is an opportunity to impose a death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed 22 counts against Saipov, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detail planning and thought," prosecutors said, describing the way Saip carried out the attack as "crazy, cruel and depraved."
"Sifulo Habibulajevic Saipov has caused, harm, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paggucho," says the state's intention report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the New York South District case was prosecuted.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
The police said that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent after all 22 counts of prosecution.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a confession of guilt and to pass a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Party MP "Tori" says Nigel Farajj should be in charge of the Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Tori party's conference promised to "mobilise the popular army".
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Teresa May's deputies proposing that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn on the Birmingham march said that the United Kingdom so far "would have been out of the EU" if Mr. Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms. May in bringing together her deeply divided members was stressed by the Counter-Bregsit members of the Tori Party who joined in a special protest against Bragsit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite pro-Bregsit attacks, counter-Bregsit faces and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said at a pro-Bregsit gathering "Leave Mens Leave" in Solihall that he wants to "refuse the plan from the Chekers".
He suggested Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Braggsit, but we must reject the plan from the Chekers."
Voicing his stance against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars so that we can now be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestions that public opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is entirely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori Party and a pro-Breggsit, was also present on the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the plan of the Chekers and start listening to us."
In a targeted message to Mrs May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraž at the assembly said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Braggsit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of handing over Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has enabled us to win in Braghsit and that will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregsit faces marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour assembly in the city centre.
Following the group's assembly, a small number of activists appeared this weekend carrying banners with the inscription "Toryans v. Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party mocked conservatives about security issues facing the opening of a conference on the application created by the party.
"These are the people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Bregsit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider running for president" after the November elections.
"Boston Globe" announced that the Democratic Party of Massachusetts' representative spoke about her future during the town hall in West Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's re-election against Republican Party official Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidency, in which he used the form of a city assembly.
One of the audience asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included setting up a top woman."
Suspect was arrested in the case of the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the LSU team.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that happened Friday was arrested.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Ditéon Simpson, 20 at a press conference at 11pm Eastern Time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting, requesting help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wad Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, announced "247sports".
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing weapons, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
As a teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances of the mine season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 matches.
Gran Prim Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders provided him with victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From a half-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in a stalemate as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Bethel went first into boxing and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing circle later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the interior of his free risk to stay on the side of a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstapin started out of the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimmy Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He finally got into boxing on the 44th lap, but couldn't raise the pace in the other eight circles, so Raikonnen came in fourth.
It's been a rough day today because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestein at Saturday's rally over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has proved that people are "wicked and rude and dishonest."
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has happened in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and ruthless and dishonest," he said.
"When you see the announcements and leaks of information and they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestein, have you published this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish... no, we didn't publish," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Finnstein on charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was published in early September, but Finnstein denied that leaking information came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story," Feinstein told the committee, announcing "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what I asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same rally on Saturday: “I’m going to tell you one thing, it was a really bad speech on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their spite, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to step on to regain their power and control," the president said, as mediaite said.
Elliptical league: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for "Giants" in a match against "Dundee"
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the match in the elite league framework Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
"Giants" gained the advantage of two goals that Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier achieved.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney had the advantage of the host before Dwyer returned the lead to "Giants".
Francois Bushar tied up for the Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season within the elite league for the boys of Adam Kifey, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with "Giants" winning the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, or at 3:35, with Kendall McFall's addition, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assists Kauni to reach the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure "Giants" took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the score being 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen ensure for the first time the leadership of Dundee in the match late in the second period and he ensured the victory of his team at half of the final period of the fifth match.
"Giants", who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday in the Milton Kanes home court.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape an earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia has been known as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulavesi Island on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to desolate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey Airport in Palu, which was constantly swinging.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was then on the runway, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was breaking down.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still below the ruins, while many cannot even be approached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral would take place Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarkets are all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidododo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated on the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man disappeared after earlier saying that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
In a statement "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they cannot find the male passenger.
The airline said it works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to demands for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven persons were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," said Jane.
Jane said that he and the others were able to cross the water that reached them by half and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port’s reconstruction also helped save by transferring people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show 111 people have been killed in airline accidents registered with the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have included Air Niugini.
An analyst established a time frame on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he was using phone records to connect the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that show that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, "The Clarion Ledger" reported.
When based on the data it was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Telis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He has erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence is due to present its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide the case later on the same day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in his music.
"The High Breed" by Bristol argues that hip-hop has distanced itself from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lovekey".
Another black girl?!
New York nanny sues a married couple because she was fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a married couple because she was fired on grounds of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from a mother complaining about the fact that she was “another black woman. ”
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the lawsuit is actually a "coercion."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of new caregiver Giselle Morris learned that she was black.
"NOEEEEEEEER ONE MORE BLACKER," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in the message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasko-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "uncomfortable" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an Afro-American, was doing her job badly and that she expected the nurse to be from the Philippines instead, announced "New York Post".
Ms. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sued the couple and sought compensation for a $350-a-day layoff for a period of six months, an engagement that would involve her living with her family, what she was initially engaged to, but without concluding a deal.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it is discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist, saying Mrs. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco, husband of the Post, said.
"But would you entrust your children to a person you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying that the lawsuit is "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still in progress, the public immediately condemned the social media’s married couple, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
Padington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect with a talking bear, the new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington's huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before getting inspired to write the book of a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt a silent pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt Padington so real, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you yourself.
I think Padington's success felt that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited them to Padington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"I hope he called regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that she will not survive," said Mrs. Edin-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart pumping slowly decreased and they came out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
All I had to do was sit here and wait, aware of the fact that all of this was happening.
I could not scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Edin-Laperuz mourning her daughter's loss boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Griefed women place cards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leedney says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everybody remembered him after his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a very dark place. ”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis is making the cards "for others to know that there are people out there to talk to and to whom they can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you need to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner Mark who was married to 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn't say anything," she said.
"We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he didn't look them in the eye at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death is a great trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “That kind of thing destroys the family.
We're broken.
But we have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain after the FBI launched the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, or a limited time investigation, with a limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is falling apart in conditions of ingrained partisan stateless.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is solely due to the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who also worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate's vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea “declined ” under Kim’s leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Bejeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean UN ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyeongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and which can be better compared to the well - protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them in force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stagnation of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused Saturday of US sanctions for stagnation from now on.
"Unless there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Cavanaugh "hysteric" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that, given his temperament, he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was "hysteric," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Coffee emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional about his opening talk, sometimes even yelling and snorting about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosy said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he proved biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosy did not answer the question of whether she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from office if allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosy added that as a Democrat she is concerned about possible judgments that Kavanaugh will bring against the Access Health Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer the questions about whether he would annul any of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go into court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really sharp criticism, months and years of collecting anger that she can't free herself without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “I was helped by a woman who performed executive functions somewhere who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she tells the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve to anger partly because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated me is when I once began to cry with unspeakable anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager, whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've reached you."
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado during that time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair of a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he said to me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched a long time ago, it was underfunded, and promised not to enter the race unless it collected $2m.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave her men $1,000 apiece, would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotion, or gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you'd seen me you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire at the start of the trade war between the United States and China was stifling, although the battle is far from over, a clash between countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has increased significantly during this week by introducing new $200 billion (150 billion) tariffs for goods, which effectively taxed half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been returning each time in kind, or recently imposed tariffs ranging from five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return the United States equally, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same one soon.
Getting Washington to back off means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing goes well, pressures from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run because the interdependence of the two economies will decrease.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than it was previously established by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a plaster tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee returns, said foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making an effort to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives are now provided.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime hails assistance in restoring the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has won a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team in the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a European field and has not won the title of the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first blow from a hole, pointed the ball into the water in a pair-3 to the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been highlighted in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament started in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the lowest ranking player of the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranking player in the world lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became a European who won the most title in the 25.5 points tournament during his career.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," the emotional Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He is now giving up his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2:1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an amazing statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend trying to guide the game towards low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furick after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we gave the team more difficulties from Europe.
We fought.
Cap down for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They beat us.
