On an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During an emergency call with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed to come home.
Lamb predicted that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," was a letter signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where the police believe he shot Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard shots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school forced students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorized authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by State investigators and students and employees who knew him jointly created a picture of a talented but likely problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Gautier Police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record of any criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with another 17 members of the Faculty, and many students attended courses at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclines when it came to problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba was obviously upset."
Lamb won't answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a single gun in the yard about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, though Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3,500 students in a city of about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He got a doctorate in education in spring.
One of Lamb's long friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was this great older boy who taught her guitar playing for several years.
He was a heartbreaker back then.
The heart of all the girls is white as soon as it appears," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O’Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said about her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O’Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when Abigail and I graduated from the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julet Room, a slowly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the sweat that Lamb played on guitar and accordion for the countless crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to fake and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in his first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boy's student club and student government.
At Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, attended a reminder event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in a vigilius during which the university council sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," LaForge argues.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagner Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there was no evidence that they were actually built.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us declare that they will not recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of toys and products claims that it will give both current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres around the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and the staff will be arriving in October until December.
While the holidays in themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily receive aid workers in shops and sales, for dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons as well.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I thought that there would be Princess Diana sitting there," he said in a trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts, and I'm beginning to realize that I'm within my reach for something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in time," is the document on "Back to the Future," which lists interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecki and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document I've ever seen."
"Back in time" will be available for Vod, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons only make the violence and suffering of millions of people worse.
Once again, the UN chief urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a central press conference that he is planning to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, which they demonstrated in reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to identify him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others over the wave of their hands like an unattended joke.
And some people are getting ready for implosions.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it yet.
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for the nomination chances of this property magnate.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this period of 2011 Rick Perry's leadership made his way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end neither of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are starting to put their dollars on a stand in order to overthrow it.
Here are some recent voting numbers suggesting that the real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump's benefit assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Montmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, that was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick to the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac last week, 60 percent of the Republicans found that Trump had a positive opinion.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "excess" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they'd be "enraged" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent people said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Another of the closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim that they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush's favorite company became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his indignation and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are in favour of the idea that the real one has the right temperament for being president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the senator’s club in Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of the Republicans think it has a commander’s personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet, 44 percent think that they do not have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say that their temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who will most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's a change from the late July when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: Voters of the GOP did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28 per cent bid for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Nevertheless, it appears that a number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the scattered field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But research by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always the majority support.
He runs over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bush by 19 points, and finally by Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead a merchant with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match against one.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's followers claim to have already made their point.
The new CBS/NYT Tuesday survey shows that only more than half of Trump’s voters claim that they will not change their minds.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door for a change between candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outside colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in the announcement of his campaign, immigration continues to be the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s infatuation will lure key Spanish voters away from the republican side and seek rebranding.
However, according to a new Monday public opinion poll ABC/Post, six out of 10 republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the immigration theme remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The government's frustration is reaching new peaks.
Today, Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 republicans in a new Monday's ABC/Post vote say they prefer political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republics in Iowa are frustrated by the republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "hell angry."
The House supported a greater proportion of the State's coal charges.
Czech Republic gets over 400 million.
In the first reading, the House of Representatives supported the government's amendment of the Upper Law, which regulates the amount of fees for the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them additional money, both the Treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The proposal was criticised by opposition members who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as well as so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.In the first reading, the Chamber supported the government's amendment of the mining law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive more of the fees from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the state will rise to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The template also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the plants that the company earns.
The change in the costs of mining is expected to bring more than 427 million crowns to the Treasury in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities' budgets are expected to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, some 450 million crowns and 150 million crowns were charged to municipalities.
About 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns came from brown coal mining.
The novelty is also calculated by increasing the remuneration from mining areas with authorised mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these remunerations is to continue to belong to the fullest extent to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the municipalities would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns annually.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as the sum of the amount of gross undergrowth and the rates for each species of undergrowth.
According to the Government, the change is due, among other things, to the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Bend warned against setting a fee by government regulation not to comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging the underprivileged growth which is a state asset.
Fees shall be paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the foreign and a quarter of the state's money will be received.
The same ratio will also be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that he's going to charge on the mining fees is going to be tied up on purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a spa rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that they would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have since they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner, elected in the Ustek Region.
Prior to the rise of unemployment on Mosteck, KČM Member Hana Aulicka warned.
Kadner and Aulicka were unsuccessful in proposing a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law back to the government to work on it.
According to the mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price rise.
"On the other hand, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is profitable.
According to the rapporteur for Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal is to benefit even from the limits, then it will have an impact on revenue for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit below of the Czechoslovakian Army should not fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy, according to him.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as one, setting up will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear during the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup in India on the board, and this time each of them will likely hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to place the load on the entire quartet under difficult conditions.
There is hot heat and high air humidity in Delhi, so difficult matches are expected to last up to five hundred.
We have to take it into consideration.
I'd like to spread it by the weather.
And according to what it will look like, said Navról at today's Czech selection training in the centre of Raj Kumár Khanna.
With one team and the world's 40th, Jiří Vesenym counts for Friday and Sunday two games.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to turn into a two-way position.
I want almost everyone involved.
I've got this slow in my head, but I won't tell you yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in Czech composition should be Stephen’s participation in Saturday’s four games.
It's just a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblist, who has a cup of Davis in the four-game balance sheet of 18:4.
It's probably not gonna be a happy one.
There are options left with Rosole, or Adam Pavlask.
"I really don't know who and what it'll look like," Navral said.
It is decided according to the development of two games.
The variable can be Pavlásek, with Joy surprised in the 1st round the win in the log over the Australians.
"He's decent in the trunk," Navratil said.
I did well against Australia, and when I play, I'd like to show the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
The houseman will put in Yuki Bhambri's double game (125th in ATP ranking), which won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth hundred ladder players.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but we've already convinced ourselves many times that the ladders in the Davis Cup don't decide.
"Decision of the momentary form, the weather," Navratil said.
Friday opening games will begin at 6:30 SELČ and can stretch due to the weather.
It's supposed to rain, and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it may be played for artificial lighting, as appropriate.
They've already lit it, and it's got about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be put under the light," said Navral.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been highly anticipated since his election.
The new work leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will for the first time cooperate with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership that comes after his appointment to the shadow office and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during the singing of the National Anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in a respectful silence" and recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corby's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend that the Labour Leader sing the national anthem "no matter" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corby's top team, quoted differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "stressed" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party "very clearly" objected to government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Delinquent Party faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "out of the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain both from "needy answers" and from tooth business, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow of business secrets, will represent him on PMQ when he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea that he would let other colleagues step out of his way from time to time because he let himself hear that he was still discussing the whole matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the policy style "Punch and Judy," which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of judgment of leaders, their management of the House and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoons and need far-reaching reforms.
"Foce in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
Johannesburg Center is a tough place to go for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra rises while salary growth in the UK accelerates
Libra jumped on the following data and showed a recovery of British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above by the SABMiller offer target.
Between May and June, the gains of GB, including bonuses, increased by 29% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling raised more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up from the euro to €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed to 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after getting closer to the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approximation of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Rival group of luxury Richemont goods.
Richemont's latest sales results are above expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest decline on the index and fell 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his company rating to "sale."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in mid-year in profit before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansions
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wages for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it's unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer jobs.
Opponents of Prague apartment marshmallows have lasagna.
Controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investmenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Against the building to be built in close proximity to the Anez monastery in the centre of Prague, 1 hundred people protested before the Prague office, and petitions also arose.
The magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a violation of the construction law because all the territorial decisions had not been complied with.
"The relevant territorial decision does not contain certain features, such as the type of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, a sufficiently clear and clearly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the construction," his decision reads.
As an illegal magistrate, it also considers that some of the grounds for the decisions were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
For example, it is the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be created on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its consent.
However, it appears from the inventory material that the owner of the land only gave consent to the project documentation for the land management, not consenting to the location of the building on his land, the construction department writes.
According to Francesco Augusto Razett of the investor firm, the construction board did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the time limit for the start of the review has expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we respect all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press report.
The project, which is dubbed marshmallow by the alleged façade color of the people, raises strong emotions in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people gathered in the past to protest the construction.
Associating themselves and the inhabitants of their homes, they object to the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that would have looked different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anez monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
On the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NPÚ), the Ministry of Culture rejected the permit of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investmenti with windows in face shape but NPÚ and master's monuments approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the statements of opponents, he said he never counted the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink white sugar.
The Czech politician took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them, too.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the road, he took three Syrian refugees along with his crew into the car, who said they wanted to move about a mile and a half.
At the time, according to him, it was not criminal in Hungary, he told the People's newspapers.
We knew that the officers of the law did not interfere with such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us to our surprise and moved us to a detention facility in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours of politics.
The officers said they behaved properly, but they were bound by communication, because they were not very good English.
However, according to him, the prison was threefold.
In our cell, for example, about three times four metres [4 m] in diameter, 15 refugees from Syria were under pressure.
Among them was a two - year - old boy or a four - year - old girl.
These people had been imprisoned for the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg reported.
What's not to entertain anymore?

Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers join with brands such as Dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA shops and owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defence strategy on September 29th, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in Eastern countries.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will count on 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first trades that took over from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
This week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retail could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the following year, and will generate sales of $500 and 600 million on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed Metcash price base could cost around $13 million on pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the Eastern States, especially in Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's latest survey found that the buyers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the head of the Hamish Douglas Fund, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that the Melbourne business lunches could "probably disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and Metcash’s sales revenue, which supplies around 1200 IGA’s retail sales, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of a change in speculation because sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale trade has gone to counter-attack and invest more than $150 million per year to compare counter-attack prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers re-contain trade by adding fast-growing food and news from the public.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the price comparison and equipment programmes will fall and hope to return largely to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a secondary loss in a recent shout around his friend Nick Kyrgies and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a judge, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one pull to Kyrgios and I should have pulled him also."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after the cramp damaged Richard Gasquet's potential defeat at US Open, Kokkinakis irresistibly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Grothe on the second two-game position behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I was quite intensely thinking that in my opinion Thanasi was a little involved in the entire dispute," says Healy.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take his own anger out of his rocket because of his frustration.
But he did really well because he was exposed to a very provocative circumstance in the United States because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion, he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, working very hard and fits the team perfectly and so on, never had a problem with other players, in the wardrobe is very respected, training hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I briefly think he deserves to be judged according to his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgie because of the important match that begins on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the Canberry cousin to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think that Nick has stepped up very quickly as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the public's eyes, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and for a while outside of the rumor, when he can think about it, it's the best solution for the team and for himself, in my opinion.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to illegally exceed it in order to halt the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in the country, and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who have been trapped for an unknown time on the country's belts between the two states stand those who flee from violence in their native countries, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants call together, "Open up the border!" and hand over the orderly units of the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect injury.
During the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Concerns over the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-nation bloc did not come with a single immigration policy at the continuing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and spoke about the prospect of reaching a possible agreement another month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened on Tuesday a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not rely on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's threat situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a fence from a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D ́Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who were helping to pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other countries in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who pursue a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of the 4m fence which the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also lays down longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of threat," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have a clear understanding: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of an army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press on the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, orban's counsellor for domestic defense, said that the authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and had already caught 15 in the state.
They have infiltrated the fence and are now charged with committing offences under new laws in police custody.
The authorities quickly let the fence fix.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after the use of a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing of Roszka, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened up a small office in a metal container for processing and pressured people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's Jump in front of Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic Competition of National Nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining her lead.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic primary voters (a 58 percent decline), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to be president, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the opening of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions which the candidate will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton's land has been lost under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some.
Clinton keeps a big headway between women and eases, but her leadership narrows down.
Her support among men has fallen significantly and Sanders is only losing 5 points on her.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and now they're equal with Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has great leadership thanks to the older voters.
Last month Clinton had a double-digit lead in front of Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters across the country say they would have been enthusiastic in supporting Clinton if she had become a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would only support her for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I don't think it's a surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited about her.
The views are mixed between those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of the democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question about why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), that it is time to be president of the woman (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, a great choice and compatibility of problems are cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidate for the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary voters would like to see a third think that he should not run again.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most frequent choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, she listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden will run to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Biden is a far second person on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely choice is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of election.
Like last month, not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key features among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and credible and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, that is, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that view.
The primary democratic electorate also generally sees that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As far as all these measures are concerned, perhaps a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision on the use of her personal email and server as a state secret continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of the matter has not affected her at all.
But between the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public’s views on this issue were divided in March, shortly after this problem came to light.
Most Americans argue that this e-mail controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of them have worsened their view of Clinton.
These are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and credible among the voters of her party, this issue is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a decline of eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honorable and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush were the best friends.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take an opinion on him.
The margin of error in sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished at Donald Trump in the National Elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and others leave the search for support.
Voters from a number of republics throughout the country continue to support Trump with a heavy majority, and climbed from 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson was leading well across demographic groups, and expounded Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of Ohio, John Kasiche, is behind with the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely at the stage with 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error margin for sample 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey last week showed that Carson had improved and reached 19% of support among the republics for Trump's 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
In the upward trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon blindly in service, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during an overwhelming brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Brotherhood members of New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Denga during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and took him late to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police report that he had his eyes tied, had a bag full of 30 pounds of sand on him, and was repeatedly harassed when trying to reach his destination through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches and then fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and they were reportedly waiting an hour before they took him to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Dengo's dress, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the welfare of the brotherhood over Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been demolished as a result of fraternity overload, and at least one student dies every year due to overload since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The grand jury, Monroe County, recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault by harassment and criminal association.
"We want to keep not only the persons involved, but in the event that there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also drive them to the responsibility," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood cancelled their relationship with the local branches.
This is when Fed raises interest rates
The growth of tariffs will come and the bull's market will collapse, the yield of bonds will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, specifically, it offers a history of a small timemaker.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve system in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate increases start, but rather on the trajectory, how long the normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all calls for increased speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said in a remark to Julian Jessop, head of the global economy Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low, resulting in a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a view of how some economic areas will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the re-stopping of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the delay in monetary policy," analyst Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years is often the most - about 14 per cent - heading towards an increase in prices in relatively flat days in 250 days (average increase 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's main strategic company, published at Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares is tending to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decline.
The recession is a real economic life, but rising rates often help.
Currently, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could have accelerated the recession.
Most remarkable is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when increasing the Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 increase in rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect to maintain it, with only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question "that this time is different" could arise," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow in Fed all year long, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which was held this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trade indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the up-to-date cycles have been in the super cycle of increasing leverage effect with GDP covering peaks at the beginning of the recession very quickly after starting recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than the Feds have been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, now we are 74 months and we are still continuing.
The return was also profitable because the market expects an increase in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in shares when Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, income appears to change the direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that the increase in rates will result in an approximation of the yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which will offset the curve.
Debts with high yields often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about tightening the yield," said Schwab, a solid analyst in her analysis of Kathy Jones.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to prospects of a stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is more flat, the credit margin has spread and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics as Fed tightens the policy.
Generally speaking, companies that run most of their business in the US will win interest rates after the increase and local products will become more attractive.
Supernational companies with a lot of debt will suffer worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the space of the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares is to be overcome within three months of the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsve reported in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets have been preceded by weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields, as well as low-volatility stocks, have also exceeded their counterparts' lower quality on average by 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
A company with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Despite purely stock games, consumers also benefit from the growing dollar.
Partners can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, said Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "stupiding"
The view becomes that it is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
Ambassador Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" in Classic FM, claims a leading member and gathers fresh pressure to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service station seems to be "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched in December of last year.
The BBC Music Awards that began last year seem to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that concern me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charges on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and the creation of music is actually on the top level.
"I also think that Radia 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only feature of BBC production that got under fire because of stomping to business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was made "a typical BBC fashion."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when the next time it starts a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude orders from more future series of The Voice or spending money on license fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been rising at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be at fault
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the entry into the records itself in 2000
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be a reason to stop spending
For more than a decade, shopping on the rise was virtual, and thanks to it, spirit cities have become of many British main streets.
However, experts argue that signs of online sales are emerging, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure in August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement, with only a 5 per cent increase compared to last year.
Experts argue that signs of online sales are emerging, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the last years and go back to 2000, the condition has always been rationalised over time," says the IMG Market Index editor for Guardian Andy Mulcahy.
It explains that internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat withdrawn, and therefore it seems to be reprimanding.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could abstain from buying before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and drop several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows buyers to re-contract, can keep customers away from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion shops.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of cranes in Mecca and the Bin Ladina family has been sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group construction magnate.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane’s fall in Grand Moscow, Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims across the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose a path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen made his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosques and dropped on the believers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of bin Laden's family over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Moscow in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first journey when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj.
Saudi officials have already promised that the haw to Mecca will take place, and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman today stated that Binadin Group should not have left the crane’s shoulder above when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried out by the State operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English Disciple Agency did not report this detail, but stated that travel abroad was prohibited for the head of the company.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims advertised before Haj’s wilderness later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any declarations on the collapse of cranes and has not been made available to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of non-application of the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Ten cranes surround Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi-Arab ruling family for decades and they've been running large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of a apostate whose family gave up in the 1990s.
The crash took place in the middle of a strong wind and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom arrived on a path that must be carried out by every capable Muslim at least once in their lives.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£ 174.000) will be devoted to relatives killed, and the same amount for permanent injuries.
The other injuries will receive half of that amount.
Chief B&Q claims East European traders working for cheap trend

The British say they're dumping hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with hammers or paint brushes, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do cooking work at their home, according to the head of the company for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laura, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible price is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix stores targeting traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laura claims she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
At present, most male workers are.
She said that there was a need to address rising demographic trends, which show more women's households that made more domestic adjustments than they did in the past.
Mrs. Laura says, "We still have men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions on purchases of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of only five women in the steering wheel of companies under the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women between employees, including the Executive and Financial Director.
Ms. Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find the good women we would take to us.
Kingfisher announced the decline in profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing trade.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
A December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Deputy President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
ODS President Zbyněk Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard validation because it would be reflected in other years.
"We have space to find the mechanism we will arrange," Stanjura said.
He supported the initial proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which the law was to be validated next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, who she said were not pink.
A higher clearance next year would amount to a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorisation has been reduced.
Reporter Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
This right to pay in December will greatly complicate and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of ČSSD Members Roman Sklenák therefore proposed to shorten the time limit for the committee to discuss the standard for ten or 20 days, and it blocked the rights.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money is to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
Next year, pensions should increase on average by about a stokoruna.
The contribution should be made according to the pension novel by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
Those who lost their pension before their payment in December could obtain it.
However, they would have to apply in writing for a supplement, not later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly validated by January, about price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year's pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, the state invested 314.7 billion crowns in old-age pensions, which was roughly five billion more in the year-on-year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
Last year, the average full old pension increased according to figures in the State Final Account by 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 reasonable pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his plans for political career, will be committed to science.
The Senate chair, however, had a billionaire according to Russian media almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region of which Governor Nikolaj Cukanov, as the candidate of the government of the United Russia, defended his post in Sunday elections with an overview.
Under Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but they are elected by the governor of three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor's election.
After the elections, the senator of the three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad area for 20 years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin, he is an exceptional and authorized ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theorie tiger is over.
The last drop in the main hero's predestination is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost his strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janjour decided about Grandpa's life, age, and funeral.
It is clear to Jano that she is on a similar path with her wife Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
Desiring to regain government over his life - and as a solution he chooses to flee from the previous, he referred to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a form of comedy a type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be given to Bartoshka, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible series.
Still, an actor who appeared in front of the camera after a prolonged break in recovery after a serious illness surprised him.
We had an agreement three years ago.
I gave him a script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a tight jock.
In the past, he was always asking where he would sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode a bicycle, climbed rocks, and even walked up the hill.
And all that in the record tropics, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoshka, women are taking tigers to turn them into rabbits.
They're gonna pour some food on him, but they're gonna close the door so he doesn't happen to be playing outside the tiger rabbit shop.
And we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, made Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathic, and she means it well.
But at the same time, the usurper, who wants to make her husband die, pointed out Bajgar.
The film also parallels the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanya Wilhelm and Paula Beretová - and the sons of Erik and Pepik - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohak.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google has promised to provide another $5.5 million (132.6 million) to organisations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charity for this Internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech Member of the European Parliament behind the movement ANO Pavel Telička postponed the planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telika, this is justified by the EP resolution of last week, which criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and whose co-author Telička was Telička.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telika lost the opportunity to interview the official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, explained in a press statement his Brussels office.
The road, which had been planned several months in advance, wanted Telička to use it to meet with Parliament's leadership and representatives of the execution, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, explained the text sent by the Czech Republic.
The EP resolution condemns "the unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on the European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling on the Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadidju Ismail, who argued for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not rule out the formation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future when visiting Novosibirsk.
We don't have that kind of plan yet.
Nothing's been ruled out, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, deliveries of Russian weapons and military material to Syria increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakiya, which remains the garden of Syrian President Bashar Assad for the time being.
But Washington has no specific military intentions for Russia in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, who had been on the third phone for the past ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu goes to Moscow to explain his concern about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House speaker Josh Earnest named Asad's support by Moscow as a lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria were said to be rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, from Syria made its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculations of Russian press, is to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader said that the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas was inappropriate.
According to the report of The New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude President Barack Obama from meeting with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
The views among White House counselors seem to be breaking up so far.
TASS today, with reference to the words of the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskova, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on his New York program.
Put sesame oil on the gallbladder diet, the hemp helps strengthen the immune system.
The good way to increase the flow of blessed unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing cold seeds, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a medical diet, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
These are, according to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, the most common cause of death in the Czech Republic for several years.
Gastrointestinal inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are among Asian kitchen lovers, you may not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for heat treatment of foods and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used on a gallbladder diet.
Essential fatty acids contained are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, the problems with gallbladder are particularly related to overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used with success even on a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that this oil consumes, they should be careful about the goods from the exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use overcooked seeds for foxing, which have a greater taste.
Oil thus loses all the active substances, described by Ladislav Hačecky, executive director of Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, who produces bio virgin oils pressed for cold.
The company also manufactures sesame oil and uses exclusively unspoiled seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox can do eight kilos of sesame.
The mechanical pressing of the raw material shall be heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and the product shall therefore meet the criteria for the extra virgin marking.
There would be a loss of nutrients at higher temperatures.
Sunflower oil thrives in heart and blood diseases.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
According to research by Jarmila Hamersky, who led the Masaryk University, he is preferred in a warm kitchen by 43% of respondents.
However, frying is not really appropriate, at 180 °C it is starting to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads, and it is especially suitable for diets that help prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids which, of all fatty acids, lower cholesterol levels most.
In the case of heart problems, care should be taken for the amount of total fat and calories taken.
For example, there is 62 calories in a spoonful of sunflower oil, 99 calories in a spoonful of rape oil.
Regarding the energy value of food, it is important to realize that food with nutrients is much more suitable than the so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sesame and hemp nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will continue to be extended.
The old oil is especially known for its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no failure at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are classified among so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of plant oils.
For this designation thanks to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce their own body and must be taken from food.
Omega 3 fatty acids are particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
The men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, but the Icelandic accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the dining room as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is a necessary part of cell membranes.
People don't need to worry about using cannabis oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that the company of Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoonful after morning.
The hemp oil is not particularly significant, but it strengthens the immune system perfectly, advised Daniel Vlček of the beautiful company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they are the most important nation of American grillers.
One household there is 1.4 grill.
Around the world, there are various barbecue competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life did not grit.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
In order for barbecue to be successful, we must not underestimate preparation - it is ideal to adjust meat by marinating for several hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time, when grilling, does it leave the health of a beneficial substance?
Generally, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils are then lost to the body of the beneficial substance, which is otherwise obtained from them when consuming the oils from food prepared at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean extra virgin oil can't be used in grilling.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk are immediately provided with grape oil.
The taste of meat and fish is wonderful.
In the kitchen it is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting cholesterol surpluses.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consuming grape oil helps to enhance our external beauty - improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps care for dry and broken hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold foods, such as salad flavoring, but also for the heat treatment of foods.
Thus, barbecue can be used in just two ways, in marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their suspense.
Three ingredients must be present when preparing marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, acidity will be supplied with apple vinegar and will result in meat softening.
The spices again deliver the meat taste and the oil preserves and supplies the right cut, advise Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils, it can flow through dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish are ready for barbecue, how do we move on?
Extra virgin oils are indicated by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for barbecue.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this method.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Just before grilling yourself, you'll be able to grill with oil, thus preventing the burning of food.
The preparation of the annexes is also an essential part of barbecue.
The grilled meat and fish are suitable for practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetables and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil, for example, recommend the hot summer salad.
It needs: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bundle of sleeves • 1 cup of sliced cucumbers • 1 cup of mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a ruffled rucola, sliced cucumbers and chopped peach cubes in a mixture of salad leaves.
According to the taste of salt and resist, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dig in a few drops of grape oil.
For special taste then you can sprinkle the salad with gently sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only depends on medication, but also on the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultation if they decide to have a child, social counselling, housing management recommendations, etc. are also included in the care of these patients.
Yet all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can have a major impact on the patient himself.
The more he can fight the disease actively, the longer he can work and the more he does not have to fundamentally change the way he lives.
As doctors point out, the patient’s passivity releases room for disease activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movements are considerably delayed when a patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads to the end of a wheelchair.
And that's why page Have a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, twice the saying that the disease that begins to heal early can more often be influenced by a doctor.
This is because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory phase where the process of neurodegeneration is not so strong.
The sooner we hit, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and put off disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis in rehabilitation care, which most often resolves weakening of the lower limbs or imbalances.
The patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain condition, to improve walking, to strengthen the pelvic floor, to alleviate swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martin Kövary, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but they manifest themselves in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is the fact that sick people check out what they can do, and that strengthens their confidence.
"In the exercise, endorphins also come out and the person feels good after it," Dr. Kamila Rásová of the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medical Faculty of the Royal Vinegardy Hospital notes.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"In the past these patients have been saved so-called, we now know that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, a priority of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physiotherapy is to keep a person as long as possible self-sufficient, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergotherapists in order for each person to receive compensation for the aid made available to him in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness strikes you, most people will be shocked.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we're going after someone, not trying to take everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally conclude that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinova - Schubertová from Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without a Prague manufacturer, Latecoere would not fly airbuses.
Air production is a synonym of precision and advanced technology.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can make and process right away.
Yet, next to the super-precious, computer-controlled machining machines, in addition to the autoclaves for forming composites, one can encounter something as ordinary as the merubic knickers.
In a drum that resembles a pot of sugar wool, a pile of furnaces is embossed with the edges of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"So far no one has found anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the Latecoere Air Gates manufacturer of the Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague, Letňany manufactures an earlier flight complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only people in the world, they deliver the door to Brazil's Embraer 170.
The doors, which part of which is being built in Prague, also include passengers in the first and higher classes on the upper decks of the world's largest airbus A380.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, instant keys are allowed to be arranged twice a year by the company.
If there was no control record on the yellow label, they should explain to the auditors of Airbus or Boeing who are regularly driving to see if the doors are made in accordance with the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human sense.
There's 1,500 rivets on one door to A320.
Those rivets have to be handcuffed.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the catching hammer, they'll know if the rivet's already right.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The range above the plane surface may rise from zero to 0.13 mm.
That's roughly twice the thickness of human hair.
When it comes to checking, a trained mind will be on its way.
When the controller runs his finger through a series of rivets, he'll know if there's anyone out of tolerance.
Then he takes the exact directional direction into his hand.
Food flight before 1989 training programme of the L-39 military aircraft.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
At that time, it was combined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won an invitation to tender for the supplier of emergency doors for model A321.
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company for them back then, which didn't have enough money to invest, and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain infatuated if Letov did not take part in the 1999 Prague Conference of the International Aviation Association of the French Latecoere Group.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French broke out, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
The assembly of parts of the door for A320 began immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the door to the upper deck for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of composites due to deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd be doing parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of supply for 20 or 30 years, Dubsky explained.
Last year, Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profits after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certification and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't make any doors to planes.
To obtain certificates that production processes meet customer requirements, and in repeated checks to keep them stand according to Dubski million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and stricter.
We need to train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certificate the whole process, Dubsky adds.
Now the company is preparing the process for zinc and nickel coating, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they received the assignment from the manufacturer, then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check out the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, the Dubai way customers control them.
The rewards are for the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race standing today, the production of Embraers falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
It is either impossible or very difficult to replace Czech Latecoere for a Brazilian or European producer.
However, this does not mean that he could say any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
She's saying how many doors are going to stand for ten, fifty, pieces of made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price sample.
If we don't, we'll work, says Dubsky.
Half the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall is a new semi-bot line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative model A320 Neo.
The routing will speed up and clarify.
"This is the trend that the installation in aviation is taking place," Dubsky adds.
The interval has a future link secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3,278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Only a few meters next door will there be a line for the complete assembly of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's our parent company's strategic decision.
The goal is to cut production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must undergo qualification tests necessary for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company, when it can also process composites besides metal materials," Dubsky says proudly.
However, Latecoere receives production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In Letov area, where they live, there is no more place.
Prior to the entry of the French mother, 180 employees were owned by the company.
Now he's got 800, and by the time he's three, there could be 100 more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing get ahead of how many hundreds of new airplanes are getting lunch every year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of the Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off the loans.
In the end, Latecoere was able to make a deal with the main creditors.
At the end of August, part of their loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors gained 37.4 per cent in the company by raising the capital by 57.4m euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company registered a new shareholding of EUR 222,9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, it raised capital by 280 million euros.
However, the entire group derives 85 percent from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing.
Average growth in contracts is expected by four percent per year up to 2017.
The purchase book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to four-year production.
The French media say that Latecoere can finally re-inhale after years on droplets.
The Czech race in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s markets.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported a greater proportion of the state from coal charges.
The change in the costs of mining is expected to bring more than 427 million crowns to the Treasury in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities' budgets are expected to have a neutral impact because the fee is to be higher.
In the preceding year, some 450 million crowns and 150 million crowns were charged to municipalities.
About 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns came from brown coal mining.
The novelty is also calculated by increasing the remuneration from mining areas with authorised mining per thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these remunerations is to continue to be fully applicable to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MEPs that the municipalities would receive between 14 million and 100 million crowns annually.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as the sum of the amount of gross undergrowth and the rates for each species of undergrowth.
According to the Government, the change is due, among other things, to the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Bend warned against setting a fee by government regulation not to comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state is charging the underprivileged growth which is a state asset.
Fees shall be paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the foreign and a quarter of the state's money will be received.
The same ratio will also be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
The part of the money that he's going to charge on the mining fees is going to be tied up on purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a spa rescue service.
The proposal today was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostová) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have since they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kadner, elected in the Ustek Region.
Prior to the rise of unemployment on Mosteck, KČM Member Hana Aulicka warned.
Kadner and Aulicka were unsuccessful in proposing a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law back to the government to work on it.
According to the mining companies, the increase in fees is not reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as power plants or heat plants should therefore not feel the price rise.
"On the other hand, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would in particular mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in employment charges is profitable.
According to the rapporteur for Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal is to benefit even from the limits, then it will have an impact on revenue for both the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit below of the Czechoslovakian Army should not fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the ČSA should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy, according to him.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the US Federal Reserve is going to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates between 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been sitting down for years since the Fed reduced their rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero and start the process of normalisation of interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy was doing quite well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great odds against this step.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 SEC.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day and his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "summer" to his first murder and that he wished he could take it back, was discovered on Tuesday by the government authorities.
Gautier Police in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10:00 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb the dispatcher asked to send officers to his house.
He said: “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that there is a “foolish dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone” but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also failed to explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, she found the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, in which she said: “I am so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message Lamb took a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
The Dean of the University of William LaForge said that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “something clearly happened in Mr Lamb’s head”.
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, the government authorities stated that there is no "no evidence" about the "loving triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, said she was a "great person."
There was a divorce 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss were all "stricken".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, according to Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she let Knowles hear.
Police said Lamb was talking to his relatives on Monday and said he was not going to prison.
When the cops caught him on the freeway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in spring 2015.
The stars that lost their magic
Actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested for possession in 2008.
I'm sure all these things are taxing themselves.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months away from the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of the Manchester United in Lize Masters against the PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and shut him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound was caused by the reckless procedure of Hector Morena in 15 minutes, when 20-year-old Shaw penetrated the PSV space.
Nine minutes was treated on the playground and an oxygen mask was also needed before it was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture in his leg, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and won't be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli Mexicana did not insist.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can assess for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their news, words can't express how I've been destroyed, my way to recovery starts now, and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United reported injuries to Luke Shaw in the PSV defeat
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coca, PSV coach, said, "It was a very bad injury."
When any player leaves the playground with that kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in the match for Mexico against Van Gaalov Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such injury, it is not good," Coc said.
I wasn't able to spot this moment.
All I saw was the ball that was heading in the other direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see any action on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6 he said to Moreno: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This thing is known by every parent: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long to learn almost to remember it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
At the request of the children's scheme provider to appoint a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of Lorax, a fairy tale by Dr Seuss of 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Funning, touching, creative and with a strong content, I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or message that I had not seen before."
Well, then, in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the history of the 2012 elevator book, which added additional figures and details to complete a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is a brief content of a book that records the object of love by the unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
It's as if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text that Cameron delivered is read as a colossal elevator of the Lorax movie, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words, "In the town of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of a girl's dreams, Audrey."
Since he was an open-minded parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would have been familiar with the history of the book, where an unnamed young man will learn that the local nature is being demolished by a reverend, tree-scrolling industrialist once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titled Loraxe, a mutilated, nostalgic creature who "speaks as trees."
Most likely, so relatively little important PR has received an assistant who has never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text most likely came from Cameron's retirement office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of failing England, but still holding
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team England chose for this tour, I think the repetition of the 3-0 defeat suffered last time in the trial series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't rule out guests' winnings either.
The Alastair Cooke page can be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this ring composition and collective thinking is strong; they will not handle the scars of 2012, only the youth's positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off England’s team in a series of experiments and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget about Adam Lyth is a tough nut for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that the cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, since — and I mentioned this earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centurys, and Lyth was able to extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more jockeys for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performances were not completely 100 percent, and it doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a burner will get to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could do to snarl is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first — although Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is the burner that I value very positively.
It's an x-factor cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 of us on Trent Bridge, which he almost did.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as its predecessors, but this will, of course, depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen starts by Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he kept four quicks, was filed, and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a professional can't launch and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I was able to watch him, he caught me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a spring, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors have decided for the young.
They'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a ringer from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for rehearsal matches can be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful playing men who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes ease and refresh the atmosphere.
Colley Durham's partner Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I don't have a problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The campaign Brexit could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unimagined strategy of renegotiation of David Cameron for the maintenance of Britain in the EU is getting into other problems with every last day and without choosing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday to parade.
Foreigners also have their own Corby and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have sufficiently British self-centered agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty that they generally did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TCC decided that they did not want this even if they ate up social protection.
We can even call it the selfies of agenda Dave and George.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo in front of the famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that the allies win for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unconcerned Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad, as was the case with the continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how they break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they do not want because they have similar separatismal tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP comments during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Re-negotiation solved the problem" and "British has nothing worth negotiating for."
Europeans are self-inflicted and know how drava Fleet Street can be and how scepticistic of the EU are the oligarch barons of the oligarch, because they were not inspired by Tony Benn during the 1975 referendum, which supported our 1973 entry at 2:1.
They can forget the name Boris Johnson, a dashing Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
It included a mix of non-tax-paying thugs, foreigners hacking telephones and pseudo non-Amoric departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with mad gorillas, you have to throw bananas at her so she doesn't have to put you to dinner and then also for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair accepted the principle of the abolished EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a discard card.
The press never forgave him, either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who was friendly to me in Westminster on Monday - I told him that I can't waste any more time - seems to be in danger of reinstating the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose seat at the BBC left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is evolving, I'll say it nicely.
He claims he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the mad tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly join in.
The same was said by Hilary "Bem, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't have decided to admit that Corby's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting for us to remain "in all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - apparently it wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC told his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background of any sensitive image Corbyn wants to share - don't forget, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important at the age of all-day television transmission and especially in faith, paranoia parochiality and betrayals that are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Party in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental distortions about EU membership - in line with their Bennito-laden economy, anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of the esoteric debate between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his twisting about NATO - Tom Watson believes that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British 'weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when lowering the costs of conservative government power, as I was reminded of Monday's start of something called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise the review of the electronic published agency Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links with tobacco industries, by researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a "marginal" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and tobacco industries.
The editorial in the professional magazine Lancet last month attacked the "extremely chalet base" on which the PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim that was allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said, "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public might expect that the PHE statement, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria analysis of the model’s multi-criteria (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the mandate of the public health of BAT in the sustainability report, he states.
One of the 12 participants admitted funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not funding that he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was supplied.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but there are several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some others at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "excusely admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "until now there is no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare in PHE, said that the claim in BMJ had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers will die because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases annually and smoke costs NHS £2 billion a year.
A clear emphasis on current evidence - even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, says former Channel Director 4
The former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public service programs, which will probably only be followed by a handful of people, in complex broadcasting times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the CEO of Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years, which worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is establishing and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without contributions from the State," Johnson said in the Communications Commission in the Upper House as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you maintain a licence fee that I am not sure whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term, it should be possible to reduce the production at least as far as the programs that others do not produce or supply are concerned.
They're sending The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a ridiculous joke and, of course, pointless.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed in non-contributory terms.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and of course produced on domestic soil.
To be honest, other channels would give them their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in any way.
Johnson, a show entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up on ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those former executive director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggert lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells the show as East Enders.
Johnson said that even more sophisticated public service programmes of the BBC "goes to BBC4, where quite often they cannot measure the audience, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their coverage mission of justification £4bn of income from licence fees, "But of course we do all these dissident programs that no one is looking at."
They're broadcasting them at a time when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the commission, "I invite you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid that much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had now been classified as educational - it was 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and should have been taken as a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and changed to "information, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a handful on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the worms are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small scales change direction at a time when sound impulses, which are invisible to the human ear, are affected.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have reported that these worms are a great example of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, stated to the Guardian that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Herbs usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction comes when placed in liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of the worms.
Increased ultrasound waves work in ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, reports the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the soil using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
Then, when he used ultrasonic worms as modified, the sound waves were reinforced by microbubbles and moved to the worms where modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch on and turn off neurons by light.
But Chalasani has heard that sonogeneics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also find use in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Classifiedss depressing the British arms trade.
Take a look at the video on the arms market from Amnesty International.
Horrible killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
Shrimp shots!
And electric dazzling earrings that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon metaphors leave no doubt that this ad on the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for the Amnesty International because of the British government's willingness to sell weapons to the repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of the International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also carried out with the uprooting of posters at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one using a letter with the London metro markers with DLR links becomes a picture of a tank.
This September the swarm of arms dealers will descend to the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group's collective name helped distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which allegedly "will gain access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flipposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and expert assistant at Essex University, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world so that their art has an impact on society.

The video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook by over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without the right to honorary and graphic designer and the commentator also worked free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silently surrounding arms commercials - he saw an empty space in ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that he's trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of a more realistic, risky corporate commercial, but "by adding bright colors and animations, I've made it possible that more people will get stuck."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us arouse concerns about selling illegal torture instruments at the fair," said Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take measures and ensure that torture facilities are not illegally treated at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab discovered an order from the US Army to "on the shoulder of the AT4CS RS launch."
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armour inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an inconsiderate 19-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but until now I can remember the tense smiles of those whom I practiced - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints of others.
All I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorms can move from slightly to the nerves going to total shock.
It's tempting to be foolish to tell people where you're from, if you took a year off, what you think about Corbyn, and why you don't really love Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHA's yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It drives the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and those you wouldn't even talk to if your eyelashes were in one fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Let the people have their space.
People’s rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, movie places and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and dress underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college will come in a short time.
Your room should be a sanctuary, yet many colleges change into an extracurricular walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be loaded.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can return to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired from socialization - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One of the guys in my tracks was in the habit that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of the roasting mania, knocking on a foreign door, and having a plate of baked cakes seems a little less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you a hot meal, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homework is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it'll all end up making your face look like a nice surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decadent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and sore are likely to interfere with others pretending to sleep if you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they get angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that break people's sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass, because they were three at night and she had a note in the morning.
Their answer was to strengthen the music.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then played her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour note.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future did go to the same college as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you mistaken your roommates for your future though, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you don't recommend hearts - but if your sexy roommate is 100% not your future though, try to talk a little bit with your weaknesses.
At the moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by keeping something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you will then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve had a rough time with seven - year - old Vetka when she was pregnant.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
With the situation, I was able to cope quite quickly – I was very excited about the baby and looked for a positive.
Uncertainty, and by being alone with my child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, and today Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
She had already met on the Internet on an older Vashka cottage, with which she started talking about favorite movies.
Your friend Eva and Vetka even drove home from the maternity ward, but he didn't get too involved in the part of his stepdad.
"For a while then he withdrew from the program," Eva wrote in documentary series Four in this three.
The theme of the third series of Czech TV is just finding happiness for the second attempt.
Taking care of Vetka and the family’s financial security enabled her to work part - time and to help her mother and to help her aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately spoil your affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítko's other birthdays, and he now understands Vašek as his dad and he also speaks to him that way.
Even though your spouse has two grown-up daughters, your fatherhood in 60 enjoys itself in his own words and also gives more attention to your children.
Besides Vitek came to them a two-year-old Leontínka and eventually twins.
"It's been so natural for our family, maybe because my mother never talked to me much about relationships," she thinks, smiling Eva.
Not enough seats?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born with an imperial cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess of the amount of blood that is pregnant and are especially itchy.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, which is threatened with premature childbirth and death, and most of the time the mother will leave after giving birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy even though they were only 36 weeks old.
The emika was placed in an incubator in the intermedia department, where Vashkova's niece also works, who was able to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger, and right after I moved from IIP to my room, I had her with me, describing the difficult period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the children to be gathered in the family, Eve was not happy.
"I was a crazy wreck after my husband and kids," recalls a tough time for a six-week department four-fold mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including due to an insensitive approach by one of the doctors.
However, this was not the case, and the doctors let Eve and the twins go to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirths are broadcast by the CT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
A large number of families can be modest.
They live together in a small house not far from Prague, where Eva must have had enough with electric two-planet and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but yours made Eve more comfortable by installing a gas cooker to make food for six people more comfortable.
If it gets any worse, we'll take a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially perceptive to the family atmosphere and the pleasant atmosphere, not the size or ambiguity of the house.
So far, we've been getting along a lot better than we expected.
Although the disorder is worse in a small space and we sometimes overstep, but at least we are all close to each other, Eva smiles that can find a positive page on every situation.
Vašek's work of lighting on film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why sometimes they go to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60 ’ s, according to his words to care for family and children’s finances, how long will he do so?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be once I who will feed this family," Eva admits to the level of questioning the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly an employer.
And if it gets worse, my husband and I can exchange taxis, and he's kidding about cute blondes.
Apple's got her-her effect.
There's a display for everything.
A more efficient processor, a larger resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-recognition display, these are in short advantage of the recently introduced ninth generation iPhones.
These last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generations whose weight had slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the failure of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true for the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones, 6 and 6 plus weight increased by 14 grams in the smaller model, and by a larger 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s affair with bending in Apple’s pockets was greatly affected.
The chassis news is thus made of more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which was also reflected on weight.
But there's a much greater impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, which allows displays to recognize the power of touch.
To this end, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhone displays has increased more than twice as far as previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of larger then from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the most hard-to-use component is the display.
The weights of only 143 grams are then achieved with this novelty thanks to the peeling skin that touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the most difficult element of the battery is, but the weight of the battery has not changed in any way compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As long as the new display technology is practical, it will be displayed only when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday 25 September when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the breakfast queens been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find an interesting opportunity.
They discovered traces of modern man-to-man settlement from different times, including wall paintings, leftover tools and so on and so forth.
In the 23A layer, which according to the instruments is dated up to about 30,000 years ago but discovered by scientists but something very similar to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
Because they found traces of oat grains that apparently passed through the process of producing such popular flakes today.
With it, the grain will first get wet today, then it will dry, save the packaging, so-called plough, then it burns and spreads out.
The Paglicca cave managed to detect grains that were allegedly heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is evidenced by traces of use on two rocks in a cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for PNAS that there would be a complete process of production of flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very evident.
We also have no evidence as to how the people of the herds could eat, but the idea that it was with some liquid and perhaps even warm, of course, is perfectly logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely people used cereals long before agriculture began.
If the falcon interpretation is correct, the oldest falcons have preceded agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station report in Brno City Transport Company.
So I once again listened to the names of stops on the trolley bus: Grossačkova, Ghost, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat louder, so the male voice report was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported by a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so the deeper the noise of traffic is better known than the deeper the male voice.
DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the travelers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but certainly chose it from the studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the frame of the bus engine.
I've been living in Brno for decades, so the correct names of all these stops I know to remember, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't confess in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may be at the end of where they have gone wrong, then claim that the stop they were supposed to take was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of a voter - but better again - should be made again, and this time painted by ordinary traffic noise and engine accounting, in which the click of the speaker on the bus almost loses.
So that we don't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Herspice stations, Schmidt, or then the Dives in the creaking scarf that I crossed into in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the only day that the speaker changed.
I understood that report quite well the other day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track record.
Today, few know what the largest and the smartest of the governments were called comprehensive verifications.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was delayed.
I walked into the dispatch office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet the chief's comrade, came a minute ahead of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher said while I was signing into the arrival book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going to the precincts to revise the small mechanics.
That's not gonna happen. It's a test today.
They're all fucking scared.
What's going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be.
I ran into the hallway.
That's when the chief's door opened and the chief showed up.
Stuck, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling face.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him respectfully and quickly turned on the two buttons of the jacket the same way.
"Good morning," she answered, and I rushed to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone the old man had answered.
"You're playing," I was greeted by engineer Eva, the elderly lady I greatly appreciated.
She said she was even chief before the comrades put her down.
They're checks and you'll be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk too much about it?
They're said to be once every three years, they all have to be with them, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
I think I'll see.
I pulled a folder out of the drawer with periodic reports and there's a phone.
"Here Holtzman, come to me immediately," the chief's voice rang.
What's annoying?
Now we've met and nothing..." I've muffled, but no one's answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good afternoon, Comrade Chief, I came upon your order," I fainted, barely entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk at the desk and looking at some sort of masterpiece.
"A fellow mechanic," he said after a while, without lifting his head, and still carefully looking at the register, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the pen on the table, leaned against the chair and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, cocky eyes.
I'm confused.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that I had worked very well in my office for the past few months and that he was most pleased with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the company at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you're a line distance technique, and you have to behave accordingly.
Such a greeting as you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I concluded that I had used such a greeting since I was a child, that I had been raised so well, and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey cloth.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," bulged chief.
And besides, you're still misinterpreting superiors.
One day you'll say "sir" and the next you'll say "companion."
But I'm no chief to you, but a comrade chief.
The governors are comrades deputys, the top ferrymen are comrades of the top trackmen!
Remember that kindly!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with my usual civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor job or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief, who, in the meantime, calmed down a bit.
There's still going to be a lot of talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension in the chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it did not look good.
For a while he was stabbing me with a cold, cocky look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his elevated protruding.
He was only a few years older and played for God's sake, actually, Sudruhagoda.
Jubilee, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, how he's doing right now.
They all threw him out.
Be that as it may, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of a party organization, like all the outsiders, but even the outsiders, were tickling.
But the chief of the press has gone to many, especially to those in whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just shot me for a piece of shit.
I thought of a fart and it cost me a lot of pushing to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a shoplifter, so I wouldn't go back to being a trainee.
What would I feed two kids from?
And there's a house down there!
I was in tears, but I got over it.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all yet, you can go," the chief terminated the audit and began to look again intently at the piece he had in his hand earlier.
I got called in at 7:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, asking what and how, saying yes, that it was going to be okay.
Only Jojin succinctly said how his habit used to be, that they could not expel us all, because the work would have to be done by a fellow chief himself with his faithful ones, and that he would not threaten us.
The word "companion" pointed out, as if he knew what the old man had shot me for in the morning.
The chief's office had a nice set.
Comrade Chief, behind his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who were to decide my editorial existence or non-existence.
Kadrovák, ROH president, staff clerk, special purpose referee, something in a way that goes against war, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of a party organization.
I knew him from the scrap.
A simple liner, tossing a gravel’s pitcher or fork.
But also an ex-watchman.
Word was, he wasn't having any fun at the time, I hear. He was a pretty beast.
The bad languages said that he went to school in seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the crime scene was lifted, he ended up on a platter.
But comrade, yes, comrade was punished!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little honey in me, an incoherent bang in my neck.
Kadrovák read the opinion from the Civil Committee from his place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so forth.
So far, it's good, I've thought about it, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a statement from the party's street organization.
He was copying the opinion from the Civil Committee, so maybe the same person wrote it.
But then it came!
The parents of long-standing members refused to come before the inspection committee and subsequently withdrew, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked up to me.
He noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief ordered him to proceed.
It was worse than that.
I was a member of the City Committee of the SSM, and that's where I was won as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and the wedding, except at the National Committee, was also in church.
I have failed the party's credibility in the worst way possible.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I finished a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
This shows a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadaver read it, only knocking the chief's pencils into the tableboard interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone looked down on me, and I wished I was far away.
And I kept repeating in my spirit, "Communists - Superhumans, Communists - Superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could have fixed the bends without some fucking check.
But now?
The trainee's career was taken before she began.
Go back to the company?
I don't think that's going to work out. I'm sure the chief's going to be out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade in question?" interrupted the silent chief's question of the chauffeur.
Well, according to a previous job report.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the chaplain wasn't out of the way.
There's sweat on the corners, he's nervously blurring like he's being checked himself.
He nodded passionately and handed some paper to the chief.
"Well," the chief said, with a sign of jealousy, which was often the sound of storms.
At first glance, praise, taught with distinction, studied industry, worked as a prisoner in the task force, and met the standard on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But it's coming down to the point.
From where did you get that judgement, comrade?" he turned again to a cabbie who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that very soon he wouldn't even have to be a chauffeur.
This is where the comrade gave it to me on the way in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the precinct to the company," bleeked his cobbler.
And there's no need for an audit, and he's got an extra one, so I put it in his file.
"So when you are included in the technical function you have had this parchment paper enough," the chief said.
The cadaver was nervously blurring and had no response.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later," the chief closed the matter, and apparently, the chief of staff was relieved.
For the time being, it's stable.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
He's yelling at me all of a sudden, so it's over!
My eyes were so dark, I was so hot.
There was a flood of remorse and accusations, and I knew that I was the most repugnant creature in the world that deserved the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete opinion, I had mistaken the comrade's cadre referee, and I didn't know why the sentence was incomplete when I received it from the cadaver at the factory.
I also lived an anti-socialist life, which at the time of building real socialism supports the realms of religious darkness, or even participates.
That, yes, there was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'll do more, and I prayed silently that it would end.
I didn't care.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they took my pick-up.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's comrade.
"That would be enough, Comrade Chief," the party's president suddenly responded and strongly interrupted the chief's levity.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he's made!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side in time!
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so articulate or pauperized phrases from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us too!
Chances to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty for this young man, the truth, to support a somewhat mistaken comrade in his efforts to correct him!
It's your party duty that no one will save you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes but also loves.
When the president was finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, comrade President," the chief sought to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk, you'd have heard that's exactly the conclusion I was going to make.
They all cheered their heads, but it was clear to them that they didn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate reference to the care of the basics," I stammered when I returned to the office and cried back.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch besides Eva's engineer.
The silences listened to my inconclusive portrayal of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could get a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and prepared cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadrework.
Like a single sentence, often full of praise, they put it in one’s hands, and another, where there is dirt, they send it to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on the tip at the pick-up, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cobbler?
He's only old enough to eat or drink anything, and it ended up what happened.
"He's got it from the old man," she said.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party president?
In fact, a much worse chief, no human being.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The water for coffee started to boil and the backing of the office filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in the cup and the milk mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
Now they won't fire me, and there's another check in three years.
Anyway, comrade chief won't forget my day.
Published in the ANTI-LOGUE OF TRATI II in EPIKA
The symbol of the alien came to life.
The windmill circle above Chlum is spinning again after years.
You can see it from a distance, because it's placed on a 15-foot stand.
People around him are calling him "a fan on Chlum."
For the community, 150 people became even one of the elements of the general sign, which the community gained on the occasion of the reunion of relatives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and the fan of course we wanted to have it, everyone knows it in the area," Mayor Jiří Mašek said.
The cloud wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it is a reminder of the time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum last century was rare.
Not until 1910 did the Flemish representatives decide for the solutions that followed until the mid - 1980s.
In the village near the branch to Čímov, they had a well of seven metres deep.
Three years later the well was added to the metal structure with a wind pump, which was pumped into the tank at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice on Moravia with a cost of 2,400 crowns," says a memorial inscription on the ground floor fence of the construction of the tower.
The pump after several repairs and windshield falls served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the water struggle began to be written: on that day, the new water supply began to be used in Chlum.
The wind pump has already remained only a functional general symbol and a rita here.
The Dominant was executed during this year's cousins' reunion.
Until 2008, Chlumší decided to repair the wind cycle and bring it back to normal.
They got a replica of the original circle, reduced on average by half a meter.
The wheel was placed on the table that same year, but it had to be moved down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the right material and the wheel could not resist the wind.
Then, for several years, the flute dominatent rested under the roof.
However, as of this June, the wheel on the high-rise is turning again.
On the occasion of the cousins' reunion, the community had the replica repaired and re-established and placed at the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only draws useful water from the well to the robbery blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we disconnected it completely because there was little water in the well.
At least it turned blank.
"In the autumn we will disconnect the windshield shaft from the pump in the network basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind cycle has reached the general sign, but it is the only one of this kind in the whole Highlands.
A similar element in the sign has the honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelena Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželova in Hodonínsk, Partuvice in Přerovsk or in the Police in Všetínsk.
Nothing bad, but Lafat, I don't know, confessed to the resistance of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember very well the match against Slavia, even my goal, like everyone in my career," 34-year-old Goian smiled at a press conference.
We were trained by George Hagi at the time, and it was a shame we lost.
I hope I can score the goal now, Sparta.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 games for the Romanian team is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, says the Greek matchmaker Hybsh.
And he's partly aware of what might be waiting for him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their games.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, Goian said.
Another football player of the Prague club was not named, and the direct question came if he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slight dazzling view, he directed at the Czech journalist.
The helpless expression in his face was, "Why do you ask me that?"
He hung up after a while.
We've seen some videos, and I've noticed Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got a really good player.
What about Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone but Fataia.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"My experience with larger clubs, it can be said that he is holding the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," said Spartan Assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian already has the best years behind him, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both United and City Manchester units, but headed for the Italian Palermo, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, plays European cups regularly, fights for victory in the Czech League.
For me, this game is a favorite, but we're playing home, and we want to start a group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in peace with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košicki, who is very excited about the Czech opponent.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading company shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the seat of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, Finance Director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the shares group's headquarters, shareholders consider placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
In order to enter the Stock Exchange, Prague completes a prospectus of securities that will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
Transfers of holdings and related transfers of shares will be effected in the form of a non-public transaction with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no public subscription shares or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"An attractive offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offer in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The objectivity test of Czech TV in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news coverage of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main newscast of Czech TV.
And how did she stay?
When journalists teach at the Faculty about how media can manipulate reality, they can play today's broadcast of Czech Television Event.
About 80% of the coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Not until the first minute when the Czech Republic informed about the unrest at the Serbian-Major border and the attacks on the police by migrants called euphemistic patience - they threw stones and attacked metal bars), the current migrant propaganda - examine the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Escape not only as a threat, but as a chance.
Excess travel - The C.T. consistently uses the expressions of a runner or a fugitive and not a migrant.
The main thing is that the CT in illustrations uses only consistently and only images on small children and women.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda that has no parallels with communist agitators.
I must say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got up to a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've got fishies moving in to the meatloaf.
Domestic fish, insects with a change of imperfect, i.e., the non-performing overturn from a pet to a bug and young looks like an adult, only small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lose them.
First by hand and later by chemically.
The socialist drugstores provided some blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it was a success.
Later, I dealt with the Pharaohs in a similar way.
With a box of juvenalists that the ants brought into their nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate a new offspring.
But I turned that off.
As time went by, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as our people.
In addition, I have learned from life that interfering with an ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about the fleas and the puppies, I don't think I'd unpack to make karma worse by killing them.
In our new apartment, my partner and I agreed that if we don't have the fishies to crawl over our necks, let them eat their skins in peace, some of those invisible algae and so on.
Their peaceful existence was eventually disrupted by a spider.
It was a common kind of poucher who had long been sitting on a ceiling.
We thought he lived out of occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Since he had spent several years with us, we found that he was feeding mainly on fish stocks and that his numbers were likely maintained in a lucrative number.
A reliable regular contact with each of our needs revealed that she was a female.
We have witnessed romantic talk with our partner about a third of the size of the spider’s fibers carefully, so that it will not be eaten before it reaches its extremity.
It took about three days for them not to move or respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love toys were played, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They'll be gone soon.
In part, they were devoured by their mother, and they ran elsewhere.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, something smaller, probably the daughter of that predominant toilet.
For a time, she carefully observed our behavior from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our failure to attack as a friendship.
The initial condition of a somewhat multiplied fish has decreased again and the spider has been looking at its usual activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter, in the meantime, grew up when using a nightgown was already a disgrace.
So far, we've tolerated it, but we've had our pleasure to pour out its contents forever.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider she saw very well when she was on the run to maintain her habit.
Our talk of the spider seeing, the happiness of the mother's house was not taken at all.
Crying and crying forced her nightgown.
It wasn't too much.
There was a moment when the spider had to, in order to develop the daughter's movement, to command.
It's on me.
He was picked up in a jar and put through a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been studying with him as a friend, but I still felt as bad after so long as I was throwing away a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would begin to appear more frequently and would start to multiply in geometric order.
Wonder the world, a week, two, we didn't get any.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if that spider of the ants had somehow cultivated them, that the toilet environment was not as good for their existence as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were smoky again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their connection to the spider had to have a reason to believe that if they didn't see it, it was hidden somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere else.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator, and his quick disappearance in them caused some kind of frightening reaction.
It's more like I don't have any illusions about their eyes.
Some light was shown by shyness, but to react to hand waving or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot her nightgown.
All that's left to do is attract some spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to the Aether, and I hope they haven't denied me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-cyclone.
The ten statements of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a genius scientist of the past century seem to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deep that the fertilization was always an overwhelming finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In particular, the people's awareness of their special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also not possible to forget its clarification of the photoeffect or the idea of quantification of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the mere transcription and system of knowledge of popular theory of relativity is so complex for many people that they prefer easy approaches for getting to know each other.
However, it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a perfectly simplified form of explanation: A watch near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I have allowed myself from his entire collection of famous citations to choose the ten that literally seized me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius tries to do them wrong.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But at any time, the only one who can prove me wrong can prove me wrong.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table reflects the disorder in your mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to be fighting in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there's no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it and 5 minutes doing it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive not to introduce Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold your tongue.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlín region expect changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them stay in black numbers this whole year," hetman Stanislav Misak said.
The total profit of the regional equipment is about 32 million crowns at the moment.
The share is mainly higher than that of insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after years of poverty, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vjetín, Uherský Hradišti and Zlín, this leads to constructions that together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we were shopping mainly for appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings because without them the top health care is impossible to do, justified the plans of the Regional Health Deputy Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to changing in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In the Holy Land, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now being selected for nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a dialysis facility planned in Kromeríž.
The Hungarian Castle wants to install a new boarding house for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And Zliny Bata's hospital awaits a long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internal one, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"It is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," she said, for example, to build the clergy-based internal director of the Věra Prousková Hospital.
The five-story building there is supposed to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for the patients.
The changes that are particularly familiar with patients will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many people in one room need only one toilet on the floor, beds are unoccupied, windows are untight, and health care providers do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our boarding house was built five years ago and is now on the verge of its livelihood," pointed out the director of the Zlinsky Hospital Pavel Calabek.
In a few years it will therefore be replaced by a seven-floor modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the acute departments in one place, in addition in new spaces.
The same model already has a finished Hungarian Castle half way.
Central income already stands, and within three years, an internal income will be added to it.
"We will pay the construction off the loan and partly on our own," explained Director Petr Sladek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
Profit is still highest, and it was not lost two years ago, when perhaps the Zlín hospital suffered almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase income and effectively manage the costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdak, who is in charge of the economy, said.
Improvements are also in the hands of patients in the OC hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will be repaired, new instruments and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns.
Already this year, there will be a complete repair of the capture station, then a dialysis facility will begin, if necessary building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country when they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Covanec (ČSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other Czech states are pushing for quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but that any discussions are rejected.
It also points out that no one has yet explained to him how the refugees assigned to the Czech Republic should be kept when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Kovanec told reporters.
In particular, can you describe the position with which you came to the meetings of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas like a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're heading somewhere, they've got relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not get the answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But saying that the quotas will solve everything?
We were dealing with $40,000 a week ago, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people crossing us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to see us, we just don't know how to hold them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, have an ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, namely Syria and other countries, is a very close zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't even want to come to us, but fifteen hundred people have already made a commitment to accept us.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way more?
We have pledged to accept 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even the 1500 is that there will be 1,100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They're gonna come to our child's facility and we're gonna treat them the same way as the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will be discussing this with Europe if we can stop people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that, if registered, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet in place, it may happen that we will not keep the 1,100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will return to Germany once they arrive.
If we can hold them off during the asylum procedure, we can handle the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, they receive almost 98 per cent of European statistics for international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's four hundred people moving in.
This is the second project that has been under way so far, and there we have progressed only in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could be helped to find employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that at the ministerial meeting, the other states were unwilling to discuss with us.
But is it not that the Czech Republic merely rejects quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity to unlock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solid step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says an incentive that all migrants from Syria can do so, the report shall be circulated in hours after all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's creating another migration wave that's going to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the path is to protect the external borders - just to discourage the migration waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
It's clear to them that they don't have a chance.
Only 50 thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all saturacy of this state, including police, courts, state offices.
If we succeed in separating them and not accepting them or accepting them only according to the needs of the economies, the 50 percent of what they spend on them today could go to refugees.
As compared to the first day Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
Where do we go to get the border controls to tighten up?
We were afraid of being captured in the ranks of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're handling.
We still have several hundred vacant places in stone detection facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
They're the only people who take those people from us, and it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks -- that's a completely useless story.
So where's the break point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, three consecutive days will drain our capacity to come up with crisis plans.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could de facto meet immediately and, with a single resolution, would decide to strengthen the police on the military, give the customs administration, or, if necessary, the prison service.
The extreme variant is an exceptional state that has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think we can get that far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread the threatening information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent a declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid her debts.
The football players were waiting for their money.
Football Slavia got up on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before a court of law.
Almost three months after the proposal was made by Online Services of the Pacific Samoa company for approximately 20 million crowns.
Legal representative Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours that she was not to declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And you have to say that she had an argument.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavie became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Supreme Club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, sent out tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said legal representative Slavie Mladková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, Slovakian ex-representative Milan Ivanova or Czech publisher Maria Ličkova.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexandr Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the debts of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, there are de facto only claims that Slavie is in conflict with.
Either according to the club, these commitments have not arisen at all, or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are prepared in the event of the loss of these disputes to pay the amount.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by writing out the account," Judge Mládková said.
"All that has been paid after maturity is paid," Mládková declared, adding that unrequited are only unpaid or conflicting commitments.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debts mentioned.
Then there will be an evaluation of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the proceedings on 3 November.
However, the decision does not come at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

The incredible amount of welding curves, easy setting and spreadability of the welding source allows you to respond quickly to changes in requirements, leading to a reduction of obstacles, the need to switch the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
It stops wasting time and does not waste material or repair faults.
Flexibility is ensured, less stasis, more welding and more profit.
It's a novelty this year that premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors because they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The leading manufacturers of the world can boast similar systems, but thanks to the different software and parameter management, FastMig X belongs to the world's peak.
The delivery of deadlines that move around three weeks is certainly pleasant for the applicants.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will be extended after the Brno trade fair.
We have been over twenty years of its regular participants and almost always after it our business results are better than before, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final system is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanca was going to build it so it wouldn't fail.
But it would cost half a billion more, says a firm expert who designed the tunnel.
Blanca was better off, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanca was able to build so that there are no two collapses of the land in Prague Stromovka, claims the director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it Wednesday night during a newspaper tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will be open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to beat safer, but costs were rising exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in Stromovec were the same all the time, although the country fell only a few steps from where it began to run safer and more cautiously.
"If the measures were applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanca Tunnel failed three times during the construction.
Two times, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovec, in 2010 land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělova, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, said the Euro Week.
The construction was originally intended to cost 17 billion crowns.
When we add up the VAT that jumped twice during the construction, you're twenty-seven billion.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering, valorisation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is no longer so far from those 37, Beloslav said.
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

FedEx profit mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers.
Company shares decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the mid-term opening.
FedEx says it expects a profit between $10,40 and $10,90 for a fiscal year ending next May, which means a decline of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced view comes in spite of an increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which is shown in January. 4, and higher charges for the transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to reduced costs, higher revenues and on-line growth.
The chairman of the board and the CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "led a firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday plans were announced the day after the rival UPS stated that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra employees, which is probably the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit for the share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The sales went up by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the ground unit FedEx.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same as the higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The unit of express recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while the profit decreased in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening FedEx’s share fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent under the June 11th record.
At its most expected meeting over the years, the federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week seated at the 27 feet of the long Honduran mahagon table and decide whether after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
On top of them at one end of the central bank ornament, a two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to give the economic interests of the nation over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable there.
But since the Great Recession, the Feds have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be the X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to set off from the unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data shows strong economic growth, recent turbulence in the global financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed by adding to the instability by increasing its Federal Funds reference rate - and that is no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piezza, chief economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse for not increasing the rate, an increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chances of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market in case Fed raises rates, only if politicians reduce the decline with promises that further increases are inconceivable.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The assembly was launched by the expectation that the Fed policy would delay rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, the main economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates now," he said.
If the Feds did, "they'd have to go to extremes in their programme statement and hold hands the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that over spring and early summer she expects an increase in rates this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, this year the labour market recorded strong growth.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
The wages showed signs of a lift.
And while inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed states that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to wane at the end of last month after China dwindled its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by 16% below its record in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May maxim.
The calm situation on the market gives the Fed politicians a comprehensive calculator where to start an increase in the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened on the financial markets and reports on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head of research at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Fed.
Now it predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and there are almost no data on which to rely on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of the main interests of Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere indication of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "wield" their monetary expansion on the market has triggered convulsions all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected, the Feds can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for Envesnet Inc's wealth-management.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va, noted this month that "Fed has a history of excessive movements on financial markets that seem to be unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking of the Federal Open Market Committee, who was pushing up rates, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "Although the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Feds turned their backs on these cuts.
The Fed should take precedence over the financial stability concerns only during the major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting a rate in Bank of England.
The latest scream does not even approach this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become angry," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and it doesn't mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get on top of it.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/fund was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/congregation is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part, if you need some motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the streets.
If you're hungry about all this shopping, go eat in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to registers and has various venues.
What is in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find that in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash you and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
The good part of the store is left with a massive freezing section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, freely selling half-carcases and more.
Who buys: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as separate families and individuals.
The broad streets are located in front of shopping carts and high-rise carts.
Search: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by suburban Chinatown and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While business can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will stay the same.
The acceleration at 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
At selected intersections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided, when it joined the Senate's amendment proposal, which refused to increase its speed.
The new Earth Communications Act is now headed for the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that the law would allow for a foot-and-a-half-mile-long speed.
Against the increase was Minister of Transport Dan Äk (for ANO), according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built at such speed.
On Tuesday before the Members, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved novelty will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase of from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four.
At first, the House extended this option to highways where it could be used in selected sections of speed up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now come to his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport of the novelty, also excluded the permission of the transport police to have the last word in the preparation of the local communications provided by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also counts that the sewers, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored under the surface of the carriageways.
That's how the aliens would save their land purchases.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela is also helping to improve road safety and facilitate the handling of decommissioned vehicles to which owners do not report.
Newly, the municipalities could sell withdrawn vehicles which will not be registered within six months of notification of the withdrawal by their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on the roads of second and third classes under penalty and for freight companies.
The new is also hampered by the possibility of introducing electronic highway stamps instead of existing paper, which will be used after 1 January of next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral exprimator is going to court.
He's been at risk for 10 years for the welcome he's received.
The case concerns an alleged premature welcome party project.
In this case, the police wanted to prosecute the representative of Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD), but did not release her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, two to ten years in prison are at risk.
The main rendering is scheduled for two October days.
According to the state attorney, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, resulting from the prosecution.
The prosecutor is relying on a well-known opinion.
Former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, from the title of their office, unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company which organised the welcome of the residents.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered five related companies to speak to the then Head of the City Service, Education and Culture Department.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the council cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator and only the company Darothor entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
The two charges led to ensure the award of a public contract for the event Welcome to residents in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and coordinatedly acted at least in contravention of the requirement for a proper economy procedure, the state attorney writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore is subsequently charging Ústí nad Labem after obtaining this contract for the implementation of the welcome of residents price, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, more than five million crowns were incased for the project.
The city finally paid off only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, and then the contract went away.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least a million crowns overpriced.
Mandík has previously rejected any breach of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand these built-in causes, said the former prime minister earlier, that the city under his leadership was only connected to a similar project from the past few years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
The criminals wanted to accuse Ambassador Kail, who was also a member of the city council, initially.
The House of Representatives didn't send her to pursue.
The criminals, therefore, have postponed the plea in her case, counting on Kail to charge her after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The greeting of the residents was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of baby needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly released a dog as a fugitive.
Then they got the press to erase the tape.
According to the Hungarian police at the border with Serbia, the AP agency's cameraman was briefly detained and forced to erase the record of a police dog allegedly hit the fugitive's ground.
The Hungarian government, however, doubts this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
The police attacked the fugitives, and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his ass.
A dog of a man who screamed, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi is filming everything, one of the officers noticed him and wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the scene.
The Muzi police took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to erase the tape.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government's spokesman, Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police in it was considered unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not needing to fear that the government would destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovács appealed to the Muzi's police report to question the events.
He said the cops just wanted the press to show them if they were on some of the footage they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
"Dogs can bark -- they're trained to scare off and a little scare, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning the City will kick us, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," he shook Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of home town.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Not one team has created too many opportunities, but the ball on the kicks was longer for us.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply shot two beautiful goals," considered the game Pellegrini, whose team had scored in the competition after a long 636 minutes.
This finalist of the last season Juventus was on it exactly the opposite of each other - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the defender has only a point and with score 2:4 is located at the 16th place on the table.
And that's why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year.
Pogba, Manjukich and Morata were represented in Manchester.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps because of it we'll find a winning wave," he hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, mainly during the attack phase.
My players deserve this result.
"In front of our balancing goals we could, on the contrary, cash in at 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," praised Allegri the goalman Buffalo's coach.
"We burned a few good chances," said Yayu Touré, the publisher of City.
We have to take lessons from the League of Masters and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue with the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all the media whirring around is directed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also above.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and media full of kids carrying their parents on their hands after dusty exodus.
And that is what causes in a person - in a European person - automatically a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, notice on the sights of the docking boats to the Greek islands that the baby can't see them that much!
Well, lately we've been missing images of ships heading for Lampedus, fugitives from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades lie in the hands of thousands of young men.
From a lot of young blacks.
And the images of Callais disappeared, where these eat and black men wait for them to pass through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans had no special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There's been too much fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of a secret that it's not just the unhappy children from Syria, but also the stagnant ones - for the elderly: fashionably fashioned - young men.
Their musculatures look like they're coming out of a fit center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer we lay on the private beach of the hotel on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus.
No matter how private, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no hams.
And the young blacks came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in brand clothes and shoes. In hand, otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested, and the employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the beds.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was just in the sea was in bad luck.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the nail cap, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they laid siege to the local beach bar and started growing.
They've got tables around, they've got a bunch of sitting next to the breakfast and white guests of the bar -- reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children were running away from the dining room terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming black people drank beer straight from thirds - how in the series from USA?! - they threw empty bottles around the beach.
They screamed loudly at each other all the time.
But it wasn't English.
Then they got into the wine, too, right out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies - in the water crying and screaming, mothers with children and pensioners fled horribly, and in half an hour they were no longer on the beach or in the pool nor a black guest.
They're all gone.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in half, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had about a 20-cententimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"These are drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You have seen how they drink," answered the waiter.
Drugs don't smuggle, they don't consume.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I already figured out what they were smuggling.
Of course, in June 2105, it wasn't so important to me.
I had no idea what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians were supposed to be the first to know.
I don't think they knew.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has proved to be the main problem for the European Union that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectual and related lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the already publicly recognized main power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of the fugitives in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mostly - the old German - Muslims welcomed their fellow men.
For many weeks, they have been blabbering in news on Czech TV, as some German researchers say, almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only in Germany for a few days, he knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms more information.
For example, famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs reported.
However, the second day, the German authorities had been denied: a polling vote showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, declared: "Our efforts at the multi-cultivities have totally failed."
Then she said, "German is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All attempts at such cohabitation have totally failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, according to her, there was no evidence of a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integration. Today they live with us and we have been lying for a while that they will not disappear again.
But it's not real.
A multicultural approach, when we think we're just living happily by ourselves, has failed this approach.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, is the only one who does not have a diploma in the Euro-Parliament - yes, that is, about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play surveillance in the concentration - from a minute to a minute, as more has been reported.
It seems, particularly under the impression of the recent German politicians that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that up to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, nationals of countries that were victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they been trying, at least out there, to deal with their terrible past aggressor and killer millions?
Do those who say that there is a devil of aggression, superiority and violence in the soul of Germany?
Was it right, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when he stopped all his efforts to control the entire middle of Europe with all his power?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should have.
When he was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Velkonemecka, which led Germany and Europe to two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After an attempt by Marxists to control the state, such as the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, based on ecology, which was one of the main ideas of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunflowers.
The German elites have long defended the emergence of German nationalism, leaving in peace all the fighters against the atom, the awe-seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogans Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better everywhere in the world, fully bowed to the fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavan current that considers all Slavs to be a difficult recruitment - since Karl Marxe, who, after his parents' Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements by Schulze and the German ministers openly threaten the disobedient Eastern states, the idea of German leadership.
Which must be obeyed without an answer.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we mix in that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is the capital that always stands, especially the German that is fit and which is that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through banks and the Union.
The Sunflower Pseudovar first introduced the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-culturalism and brought them home today, bringing perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, drawn by siren voices, will soon come upon the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and will begin to storm.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours by force again, once again a part of its inhabitants - but it seems that a smaller part of it seems to become ideological, but eventually reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the coming Islamists?
Are Muslims going to come to the aid of longtime Muslims living in Germany, but certainly not assimilated in order to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, fear of Islamizing their country, do?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when the people who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro superhuman Muslim will rise?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which has triggered the support of solar ideology in Europe, i.e. the ideologies of elite and essentially totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unrestrained treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the sublime and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the incinerators is to scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock, and you've got a hard knock on you in a way that the weaker character doesn't have to resist right now.
The lively head will crush you and drive you even stiff, guide you away (or rather drive you away) of an uninterrupted seller and lively statue.
Maybe it's a shame the conversational chat can't even happen in real life.
Even with us, it'd be good to drive away a lot of scrawny and scoundrel.
Oxalis corniculata.
A tiny weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it's between the outdoor tiles near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I took a picture of a beautiful plant that belongs to expansive weeds, but it gives a nice impression of its flowering.
It is located between the outer tiles.
She's unquestionable. She's doing well in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, it's easy to adapt, it's modest, it's hard to find.
He creates leaves with chaotic compositions, but it is worth watching and photographing.
Under the details is yet to be found the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple escort.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to mediate to women knowledge of the importance of good nutrition in breast feeding using images of children sucking from breasts painted by an unhealthy display of food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and newly cooked mothers are advised to increase daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only diet measures that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's trying to take the lead on Today Show
As a result of the loss of liberal leadership, Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The morning show, Nine, projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage was stuck in London as part of a week of international television broadcasting, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance to Aussie TV is so important because it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers broadcasting Today.
Today has seen a slight increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was not until last Thursday (343,000).
Today fills the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, today averaged 318 000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to New Zealand's seaside area has an average of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself could pull a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear yes.
The X Factor of Seven has retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, thus beating down The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV show (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe said, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat of Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half of Australia averaged 520,000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia's second night rating, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which could not defeat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect kid - but who does he choose?
Secrets Revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may have been reluctant to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is covered with an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay here will definitely not betray who is the one who gets the rose after all.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they said thanklessly who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut in the quarter final.
All three women lyrically chanted why Wood was the perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, on the question, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could function as a spoiler about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and the Marcoskis quickly named Mackay as here, who would be best suited to Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from one day on.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course," says Jeeves-Fellows.
"Sarah is a truly grounded woman, she is very funny," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are well and well together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened up my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if it wasn't for her, and she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she remarked.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snow White and Lana indecisive.
Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his transfer to the United States, and many teams were asked after his great start in training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit down for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first kick-out at Tuesday's win 20:3 on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after he hurt Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also still honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing the novices in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and take care of just another game.
In the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught in the swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian Radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of his career in the NFL he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal area led to the Queensland Trinity.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimír Putin will meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovski was arrested with gunpoints aimed at the Siberian range.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovski was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S.U. stood up for expatriates who sought to replace property.
Two of them emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, assets could no longer be returned, so the two of them applied for compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The court first awarded them the amount requested, that is, over 2.8 million crowns, the Court of Appeal, but changed their claim by granting them only less than 90,000 crowns, with a reference to the award being determined in accordance with the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants have been held by the Supreme Court, and they have been awarded an initial appeal.
The Ministry of Finance, which had to pay the money, however, turned to complaints about the ÚS.
In the meantime, there has been a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the applicable legislation - although at that time it represented a compensation adequate in relation to the property taken off - today only achieves the fractional value of the property.
"This cannot be a burden for secondary participants to be in the restitution of eligible persons who have been at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to be able to provide compensation before," said the judge rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ÚS stood on the side of the emigrants.
"The US repeated its statement to ensure that the general courts proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted in favour of the rightful and that the purpose of the restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e., the dismissal of the property injury caused by the acts of the former totalitarian State," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA is now being established by Radka Fischer.
Radka Fischerová, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998 she became the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Prague theatre Spirale.
To return to the same role, he says, "today, the difficulties of Evita did not equal the power of performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
To be the first lady of Argentina, she was recommended by Monika Absolon.
I saw Monk three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a supporter of more modern adaptations, but this one is just particularly behavioural.
"The director of Ondrzej Sokola is original, relieved and contemporary," Fischer notes.
The deliberate handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolone's concert on 27 September since 19 hours at Studio DVA.
Tonight he finishes with music from Evita's musical.
The experiences will certainly be shared by Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Silence your Cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also bounce away from the director's board when he joins Karl Roden's film as President of Perón.
Due to public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech filming of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Ondřej Sokola was originally awarded the main female role by Monika Absolon.
On her side is Karel Roden as President Perón and as Che Peter Strenáčík.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with the Czech texts Michael Prostyjovsky is a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber missiles at a crowd of demonstrators against the design of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
There was violence on Tuesday night in Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu’s capital.
Bishinu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, reports that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and lighter bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles known for their ability to kill, but were traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, obviously caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the Madhes ethnic group say they set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and eased their political influence.
Further demonstrations in West Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the creation of its own state.
From August 10th, at least 40 people were killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into the provinces — a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on the provisions of the Constitution this week in Kathmand, and officials state that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely can't panic now.
After the game on the ice of Litvínov you did not even make a home duel with the hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Don't you worry about a similar catastrophic entry into extraliga a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts the 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent in the emergence of tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure system in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecast with its seat in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at selecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries on the run from war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog on a very unusual way.
Google Rita Masoud’s employee published her blog on the basis of her personal experience as a seven-year-old running away with her family from Kabul.
"We have traveled in many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is becoming more and more families than it is willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed to 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via Google.com/refugeerelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria in a four-year war that has only driven 4 million people this year.
Many people also flee the war fought by Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics it could be useful weight loss surgery
The benefits of losing surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may be at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether people with type 2 diabetes are slightly obese live longer after weight loss surgery than those given non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality takes a long time to be seen," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new JAMA surgery study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery uses different methods to reduce the stomach.
Decreasing hunger and restricting the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMIs which measure the weight-to-height relationship are considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the overweight person and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Hospital of Min-Sheng in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastriectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The mean BMI among those who underwent the surgery declined according to study from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMIs of those who were not undergoing surgery for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for diabetes comparisons.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s haemoglobin levels A1c in the blood, reflecting the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean A1c haemoglobin decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - has not reduced mortality in five years, according to the head researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After 5 years, a group with a bypass weight greater than that of a gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI reductions (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and had a higher incidence of diabetes remission (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone it is a soothing result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here this work is critical because it states that there is a safer surgery in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he states.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously after the decline of BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long for people to see the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that will firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to grasp all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that under the current circumstances, mankind’s interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, particularly through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with violent issues, Dalai Lama also expressed his comments about the actions against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the U.S. violent reaction has triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve the problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have experienced a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
The toxicological centres around the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 who had swallowed a high-alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the toxicology centre in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia’s toxicology centre, the number of use of sanitation in children under 12 years of age reported at poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more frequently and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink sanitation on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a social media challenge.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitation because of cheap yelling.
The nacents allegedly mixed an oral remedy containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the medium.
"Children don't think about hurting them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitation) devices are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation facilities with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are available for disposal, which are very appealing to children.
The sanitation agent contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, a few elbows can be alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 at Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey go to waste either, but people leave these sanitation facilities outside, and when they get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who recently saw up to four arcs of an ambulance with strawberry scent and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be adult drunkenness, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaiah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Her doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head for alcohol, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaiah.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or ensure that sanitation is available to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitation agent that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Physicians believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police assessed the dream plan as "an innocent speech," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fama: No inconsistencies in the Celtic team
Griffiths is bagging up talk about a disagreement in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll turn it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new force from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increasing their direction over Celtic by 5 points
The first half of the ADAMA Rooney's penalty secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which gave them a five-point lead between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talking about non-conformity
This situation has sparked rumours of a lack of harmony in Celtice, which have been challenged by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch leagues.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bored the Netherlands - de Boer
Former publisher Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because among them there is no longer any rivalry due to title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador of Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands, they don't show the best of Celtic matches anymore, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches, and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
I'll turn things back to the good, Delilah undertakes.
ROONY DALIA admitted that Celtic was a bit trippy, but the Norwegian boss committed himself to turning things around for good.
The defeat of Malmem and the subsequent fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the five-pointed table.
But Deila says, "Celtic's had a bad time and he'll rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the actual impact.
We're on the same page, but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it makes players much better.
It is now very important to stay close.
Warburton's worried about January reinforcements.
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his January goals, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of the force and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team's unity.
The former boss of Brentford says, "The ice window is very different from that summer."
Players who come in summer have an entire pre-season stay-in period, which you could see on our own team this season.
Team's doing really well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtica Micha’s cross-cutting goal suggests retirement
Swansea Michu, who was connected to Celtic in the cross-country window, suggested that after his contract with Swansea could be terminated, he could retire.
A 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with a tilted ankle for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson.
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - it was the third red card issued by Judge Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed to avoid Tincastle
Hard-headed Hibbe was severely punished after admitting that he sang a song with a text aimed at former Hearts Rudolph Skadel.
The incident took place at the Roserburn pub in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tincastle in March 2014
"It was about derby and it was a time-consuming moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle if it is not in Celtic."
The Tannadic Council believes in the Dundee United-Donnelly management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in correcting the situation through the current management of the team - but admits that the crash on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCinnes likes to win the "disgusting victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to cling desperately to Hamilton Access in order to succeed in winning the seventh league win each other and a five-point head start before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half penalty of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "There's no team that wins anything, no more cups or leagues without winning this type of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while UK total unemployment rises
INSTITUTIONS in Scotland remain unchanged in the number of 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 percent higher in the UK (5.5%), as shown by data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland dropped by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland dropped by 74.0 per cent over the quarter, which is 73.5 per cent above the British average.
State Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment increased, while unemployment declined.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal interventions, I will follow the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery at the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison, and I'll see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers to witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to fear.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America and because there are often more requests than there are vacancies, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will be following the entire execution unattractively.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and I've made a special connection to him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of Twitter compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the stalker how he's gonna like it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help counter the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts that I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of co-intelligence.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that there has not been sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
To that end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love die an unnecessary death.
A man escaped Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he straightened the man out of Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh running to the police didn't come out after he got into shallow mud just meters from a cop who was trying to force his way back to the shore.
Canning Vale police were called in during an incident that passed over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he was trying to get rid of them with an escape route across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"Stand in the water and repeat 'I won't go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things on the run," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins Football Champion sets a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins took a car to a ditch to avoid the bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins's biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria, and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch on Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation as regards Lidar's positive embroidery to cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the spy charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it'll all come out of you all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the most for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Before, Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Eightteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will appoint after question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things being done in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If so, they should all show their information because they completely burned me in an attempt to catch.
Robert Roulston, former RVL President David Moody, current RVL President and Bernard Saundry, current Director General of RVL, were aware of that at that time and are aware of that today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Is RVL going to grow a few balls and make people outside the coaching station take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really upsets me.
I will press them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
The coach's frustration increased with long-term investigation of cobalt including Lidari and recent scratches aroused the feeling that "he could have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, the most famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, marked the practice of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after the horse was applied to the feet by clay lining or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against racing rules.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it also happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of the linings on the day of the plant, to which the organisers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who got caught was arrested.
The police arrested a man who hit a biker at Cobra on weekends and left after the crash.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by cars on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the Shepparton police.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, stays in the hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy's hitting rivals for wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the actions of his players as "setting a plan" to two NRLs' favorites primeship.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Rogers, said that the referees allowed the players of Storm to "rescue" his players during the controversial victory of team Storm in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly disguised remark on Strom after his team won the final qualification of the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "review" of the rugby league and according to him, two from Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation raised his confidence because his team is criticised by two coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we've only been putting emphasis on contact during our operations, and that meant turning for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come into this year's part.
Bellamy despised Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team, St George-Illawara Dragons, won the 2010 premiereship by playing "suspicious" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a game style that seems devastating to him, especially his young publishers with their speed.
Such football would you like to play if you had this type of player available.
This opinion was said in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two publishers such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so such a style can't play.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that Storm and the Roosters had more goals than Broncos and Cowboys.
The game Broncos was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting to break and not discipline experiments?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have this weekend break and won the right to host either North Queensland Townboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets bail of $200,000 for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland received bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting together accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the coffee shop of the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for the commercial quality of cocaine, attorney Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he owned the whole amount and that he could be in a coffee shop entirely by chance and innocently.
The highest court judge, Peter Flanagan, believed Maximovic would have escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the Crown Case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovic jointly offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the incremental statements, it is obvious that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were apparently insufficient, for the accused did not go further in court, warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, applies daily to the police and will observe the curfew from 18 hours to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11 - year - old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children that another user sent him.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing a phone and then found it in Hogg's sleeper's hand.
She passed him, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" search on the web using expressions to find immoral images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "put paedophiles on the Internet" before he "played to be a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal representative Eiildh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked at his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send others.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He claims to have jumped in his drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shook and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the action of accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the terms of bail on 25 January and failed to hear in court on 24 March of this year.
A defense attorney for Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he may argue that in his act there was "no fundamental sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing of the other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual delinquents before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
Parliament's opening was also distorted by opposition legislators' allegations that they received anonymous threats to kill them, which warned them against the extorting of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was extorted and provoked during his speech about the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
President of the Parliament's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning against defending Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show, but is called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as it rises from Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "obavia" about threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancellation of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of his efforts to restructure and save the cost of business services of the company.
Later this year, HP will divide into two companies listed on the stock exchange and separate the trading of computers and printers from its faster growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of approximately $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, according to HP's statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the Board, who will head the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of trades that will help businesses move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion after the company's declaration and "will be aimed at providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" to companies.
This will result in the distribution of the company, which was founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest manufacturer of PC and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest of this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain Michael Arteta says the teammates must get behind the wounded Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still glowing and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason not to play again about Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in another summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great damage to this most recent problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after wounding his ankle and then got back into his former form during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger claims.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he suffered before.
That could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there was a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returned during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The survey carried out by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd records 23 different injuries to Wilshire since he had his game debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he has played only 65 league games of Arsnal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal it means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two clubs of the Premier League who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but the Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition," Wenger claims.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Lize champions about Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will probably take part.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-group process, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most terrifying stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after holding a campaign of "inviolables" last season.
The stadium shook at mid-night with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
This year in Zagreb has been the tenth.
Wenger thinks the Arsenal has learned from last season's League Champions when he capitulated against Monaco and has a distant hope of leading the club to its first victory in the European Cup.
"This setup is huge," Wenger says.
It never happened to Arsenell.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
Absence of similar displays in various shows is striking, especially in view of the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, regarding suicide among young men up to the age of 15.
In 2013 it was the only cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, she marked Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 as Year Men, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this fight lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance to experience mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication through social media, with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and successful, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker explained recently, money doesn't really buy better luck.
The beauty of the show Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that glowed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, a moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the springs of knowing that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my role as an listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come up in my mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As far as my assignment is concerned, the outsider’s condition on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater proximity, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FrenchFest organized by Comedy Central Station this weekend, why don't you take your friends to a drink in Central Perk where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from beginning to end - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria score and helped PSG get rid of Malmo page
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavanim after shooting the goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in Lize Masters and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and game response.
Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani both scored on Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey to Lize Masters with the final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malm at the Parc des Princess.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his debut in Lize Masters and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw several chances until they finally raised their lead when Cavani shot the goal with his head in 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they focus not only on qualifying for the elimination rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was vain before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In Lize Masters it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to improve with the season process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret we didn't shoot one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury as one of the three changes of the PSG team, which at home maintained this weekend's 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was in the fourth minute shaded by Di Mario.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after crossing from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran to Marco Verratti's pass for defending Malm and with a beautiful ending, he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the distant corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected it to trigger the grand victory of the PSG, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got into this phase, came with 9 internationals in the base lineup, and the five defenders and the two captured publishers were a heavy opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in 34 minutes, they did not offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves sought to benefit from the attack with bad playoffs and lousy endings, which were not good either from Ibrahimovic, who could not fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved to be much more suitable when he came to preparing a chance for his teammates and it was just from his record when Di Maria sent out a spinning shot that ended in the Wiland branch after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan head sent over the line already the sixth goal this season after Ibrahimovic played him after playing from the left wing of Maxwell.
It ended all Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could make something out of the match, and only the excellent Wiland procedure from a great distance faltered David Louise's hope and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of changing Ezequiel Lavezzi at the end of the match was unknown.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team later admitted that the PSG were a class above his team, Nor stated: "Our last game in Lize Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played Swedish leagues that aren't on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for stock sales.
Gigant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is facing commodity price dwindling, as the Chinese slowdown in the economy reduces demand and sparks distortions across the markets.
The issue of rights sent the Glencore stock price to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades at the centre of the stock price.
Stocks jumped by 2.77 percent on 131,60 pennies on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent.
Glencore discovered last week that the sale of $2.5 billion shares is part of a broader plan to reduce their debt by $30 billion, which gathered about a third.
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pennies per share, representing a 2.4% discount for closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns over the lengthening of Chinese growth decreased the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on 25 September in Barack Obama's reaction to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report was delivered.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will ask President Xi and his house Peng Liyuan for a state dinner that will be held after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi represents an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose first visit was announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the problems at stake, including Washington's fear of alleged cyberspying of China and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis scattered the Schengen area.
An emergency light fired by Germany has not fixed the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem first: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters the old continent - particularly in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas on the basis of the amount that is increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priority.
Before caring for the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"The effective management of the EU external borders is essential for managing migration," the text of the ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday stressed.
Following the common currency crisis, the EU is finding it at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increase its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary stepped on it a long time ago.
Such exceptional and temporary measures shall be admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's a blind one.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already gone to the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and German counterpart Thomas de Maizère discussed this intensively during a private conversation with three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This is not a new idea, but a stiffness is being realized.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the incoming runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory, because it fears more than others that there will be no camps on its shoulders where refugees will gather on its behalf.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after they passed overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge yawning hole.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, have put their hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan road and the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it did not give any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to all of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the European Frontex Border Control Agency's task force in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text presented to ministers for approval.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the eight-twenty as well as the question of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't even want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the duty, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the eight-twenties.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is terminated.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which was already reached in June during the EU's hectic summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, of which three Czechs are said to be.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who, as one of the only affected eight-member group, survived.
Previous media reports say it's about Poland.
About 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized with serious leg injuries in the area of her femur in Briancon.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue action ended, and the victims' bodies were also transferred to Briancon for identification," said the Prefect of the Department of Hautes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area under the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 metres.
"The huge avalanche was 250 metres wide and about three feet high," noted the head of rescue workers Nicolas Colombani.
Thus, at an eight - member group of about 3900 meters [9,900 m], there was an enormous amount of snow.
Weather services did not today warn in the area of unfavourable weather.
Trpsovský before the match with Braga: Finally a real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his premiere in the Cups, managed to pass through the European League in front of the main group with Liberec football players, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The words for the opening of the main stage of the competition welcome the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the coach wants to force her in her game style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could have cut you off on the way to a dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every hack we get, we can play our tactics, and we're not just tied up with a double.
"I am very looking forward to it and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," Trpišovski said at a press conference.
Bragu thinks it's a top team.
It will be very active, they have very Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be even harder now that he doesn't have that name, but he has three goals in his cadre.
"It is an excellent whole on top team level," said Trpišovský.
He doesn't consider Bragu a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we certainly aren't outsiders.
"I think we have shown strong at our stadium in both home and preschool competition, and we want to confirm that," said a coach whose team lost out of eleven duels this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes Liberec can also force his own style.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, and it's untypically disciplined for them.
They're playing from the 4-4-2 deployment with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, although we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
We've studied a lot of rivals in the past, which has helped us a lot, and this time we want to focus on our game, which is what we've adapted to practice.
"And we definitely want it, although it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films will take over Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year registered their works in the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which the commission composed of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will elect an international jury, said the spokesman of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its special theme, which departs from the festival sound.
This year, she's a detective.
The director of this year's festival evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to connect the elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our detention this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting of the student production - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury in which, for example, last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda will sit.
The festival organizers are preparing an accompanying programme as each year.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, Turboshanson Group Let's fly?, play band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will bring a graduate of the Sand Film School and holder of prestigious awards, among which there is no missing from the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition is approaching an atmosphere in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
In a word with the visitors, the cameraman and documentary Martin Čech, the German film The Cameraman with his music will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sand cousins Brukner, Novotny and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotno will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the FAMO patron in Písek, who recently abandoned us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from around the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties as well as the film trade," the speaker said.
This will certainly help Pitching Forum where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job auditions at once and obtain such a job.
The festival is linked to the creation of the Private Higher Film School in Písek.
Her founders, Vladana's married and Miloň Terča, organized their first year in 1997.
He was held once every two years until his sixth year.
When the CK falls, the insurance companies have full rights to the clients.
Insurance companies should pay client entitlements in the event of a loss of a travel agency in full height.
She decided on this on Wednesday at the House when she approved an amended amendment to the Act on Business Conditions in Travel.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against the bankruptcy of the bank guarantee, according to the draft which is to be assessed in the Senate.
Insurance companies are under an obligation to pay clients' rights and they do not agree on the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is in the process of adapting, arguing with consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance for travel agencies against collapse when the novelty pays.
But they also criticize travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Local Development, Karla Šlechtová (for ANO), pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full allowances were not euro-comfort.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court decision, which confirmed that the client was entitled to a full refund of the money irrespective of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will be provided with sufficient information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, emphasized Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Deputy President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to stop or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Bureau of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey between CK Member States.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The statement of the insurance companies does not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written statement in this sense.
They say that they will find out whether travel agencies will cooperate, which according to Okamura is no problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS) also warned against the provision, which referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and its party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about lubricating stairs by Czech Travel Offices.
Fischer's travel agencies won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," according to Fischer.
Her motion to release the contested passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not come forward with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to alleged opposition to the civil code.
Philip drew attention to travel agencies that he believed could endanger consumers.
In view of the Constitutional Court's version, the rapporteur for the proposal, Martin Berdich, withdrew her proposal to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance performance would not cover the entire risk.
The novelty will not originally propose a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agencies offering flights by air and a million for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such as to cover all customer claims in the event of the loss of the travel agency.
Even after adjustments, the standard provides that travel agencies will have to indicate for the tours sold which travel agency organizes the tour.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, data on the holding and number of trips.
The approved amendment to the Committee on Public Administration shall also count on the additional regular information provided by insurance undertakings.
Travel agencies will have to provide data each month on the number of passengers and sold tours, on the total price of the tours sold and on the amount of advance and sales for the tours and on the vouchers.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that a travel agency has failed to comply with one of the legal obligations vis-à-vis an insurance undertaking, it shall call upon it to amend it or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if a breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
Novela is also to adjust the financing of mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial expenditure plan and a view for another two years.
According to the association, the billmaker did not come up with a situation if the insurance company gave notice to the contract.
It will not be organised by the trash tours, and the clients who bought the trip before the cancellation of the insurance will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may also fail, although its economy was in good condition.
One of the ways travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be by applying to the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use many softer conditions abroad, and on our market then we will only act as agencies, said the Vice-President of the Jan Papež Association.
According to him, the design of the novelty also contains an institution of bank guarantees, but it is so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in previous practice is de facto unnecessary.
In a two-year horizon, the new EU directive will require a recast of the whole law.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs completed their activities.
Local travel agencies sell annual tours worth about CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be set up to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after she had discussed it with the German Prime Minister.
At the same time, she reiterated her appeal for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the member states of the eighty-first.
We need to help the countries where refugees leave, if necessary, where they stay after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will agree on decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor that such a signal could be more financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"Social countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis in the European country," Merkel said.
Land Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this context at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected, among other things, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to speed up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners more quickly, said the prime minister of defence.
According to him, the majority of the money that Germany spends on the care of runners should also be used to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed to overcome the Germans.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners succeed in integrating, they can be useful to us, he said.
Matt Damon mutilates the diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted Effie Brown, an aphroametric filmmaker, during a discussion of diversion, claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's HBO episode, Greenlight interrupted an actor in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversion, you do it by placing the film and not by setting up the show," Damon says.
Shocked, she reacted emphatically to Brown with distrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about the Martians got into the broadcast.
Damon and Brown have joined the joint producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think whether or not the director is anyone, how they will behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that's a hooker packed by a white pimp.
The producer of Precious White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancacaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their director "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was discussed, the social media exploded in conflict with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing the video, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black person in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversion is YES THE WHITE that it hurts."
Tweet has gained over 5,000 retweets and 4000 characters since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is ahead of social discussion.
After he was killed by a teenager named Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Mather movement took national action and pressured the creator of laws and authority to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February the singer Prince made hints of the movement while listing nominated in the category Album of the year during the award of Grammy.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, the album is still important.
The newest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the question of the person Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," declared the leader.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the views of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the pope, it is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
A professional climber and pickpocket Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final season this year, two men entered the final round, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of tap for more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first, within a set limit, and thus became the first contestant to overcome the four-six-stranded American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame him by three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the newsE! News immediately after his hard won victory and it was recognized that he was still in shock with a $1 million prize winning.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to my winnings.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten won no reward, despite the fact that he became the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to the person who completes the track as quickly as possible.
"If more competitors take part in the race, the winner will win the race with the best time," Weed said.
Even if the profit of the prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd have a grudge in him.
He's pleased that he's been able to accomplish what he's been able to do.
He got a hot reception from his fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
For his children and his wife, he's a hero."
Geoff told me, “If there was to be anyone who could beat me, I am glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which begins in spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit just passed Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the pink garden.
Tigers, one of America's top baseball teams, are now in the final position of the Central Division of the American League.
They just turned the Tigers back on their defeat when they beat Minnesota in the Tuesday game with a close 5-4 score at Target Field Stadium.
The twins wasted their chance to approach the Houston Astros team and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z, which for them during the second half of the season was so incomprehensible.
“To win is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive appearance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the rounds and 3 rounds.
It was only his third game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a fight when you’re sitting on a bench and that’s why I want to get in the game. ”
Tiger champion Victor Martinez struck three times and made two rounds and his first score since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last red game, in which he scored four times against Seattle Mariners.
"He has put up a good deal," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, fired significantly better and managed to move it to the game."
Thanks to the three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins won the best chance of going back to the game.
Byron Buxton's central polarity got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right polarist Aaron Hicks won the point thanks to his set bat, and Simon insisted on Brian Dozier before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy's left-handed man.
Hardy shut down his only opponent, Mauer, and before him, he had a gunman named Miguel San, who fired a ball and circled two yards and left right-handed Drew Verhagen behind.
With two players on meths and a chance to move in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third metre over two metres.
Plouffe has already gained 27 rounds over two metres in this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit backed the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured score 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this right-hand man has ruled Sana out on three occasions.
Detroit took advantage and gained points at Phil Hughes' game.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against the deserving prodigy who entered the game for more than a month due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” said Hughes, “but during the third shift I’ve felt that I’ve been able to pitch better.”
After he resisted the effort in the first shift, Hughes left one point to the second metre of Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polarity of J.D. Martinez took out Victor Martinez, who first circled all the targets.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third metre Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overrun when he tried to reach the third target.
The tigers added in the second shift when James McCann pitcher and polar Anthony Goss got two and a point, and on the resulting board, the score was 3-0.
"It got us into our knees," said the manager, Double Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in the third round without points and replaced him with A.J. Achter.
Hughes took off three rounds, got six rounds and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right tiger pitcher, ended the fight with pain in his right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez' arm in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the list of injuries due to the stretchy muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle match.
Sanchez will replace the left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and turn against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left pitcher, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 matches.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of his muscles.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
A Minnesso left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73) is built against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy into a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, which is the task of Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the Central Leader of the Group to deepen the overall reform on the 16th meeting.
The promotion of opening up in emerging reforms will add new momentum and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The group leader has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, easing border control policy, supporting state-owned enterprises (SEE) to absorb private capital and reorganising the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programmes.
This step is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, in the provision of a legal business environment and in making the market more open, the declaration states.
The government will also release controls on the powers delegated to companies and make sure that the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will allow the border area to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new regional growth support mechanisms.
In order to open up the State-controlled sector, more areas will be opened by private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with a better service," the statement states.
Moreover, it will be easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and prosecutor were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
A new bedroom department may be established in the Karlovar region.
According to Heatman of the Karlovar Region of Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the beds department of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also possibilities of extending care in the region.
For example, a day-to-day surgery centre could be established in the surgical department, where, according to the concept set, surgical activities that do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals a day-to-day surgery workplace should be, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin disease could again be created.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apalic center to care for patients with brain impairment who are in vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of focusing such a device on the island hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy region, is the beds of subsequent care, in particular the beds Treatment for long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Niedek is insufficient and in particular should be closely attached to the beds of acute care.
Part of this equipment should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends concepts.
As he points out, the post-care bed is largely missing at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings to centralize.
Last but not least, in the Karlovar region, there are no social health beds focused on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
This bed is scarce throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer’s Centre.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called next beds for which European grants will be released.
"These are beds that will be attached to the fields of specialized care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," the landscape concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
