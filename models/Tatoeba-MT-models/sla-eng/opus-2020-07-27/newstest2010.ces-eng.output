Barack Obama gets the fourth American president of Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive at the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as America's fourth president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a $1.4 million check, among other things, for extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and he'll be busy.
First, he goes to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time the five members of the Committee, who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one that gets the price right in the office.
The White House has already predicted that Obama will talk about the Afghan War during the acquisition of awards.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the price is taken up as the president who is currently at war in two countries.
War effort a few days ago has further increased the deployment of another unit to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its critics.
At the Obama ceremony, he will also receive a gold medal, diploma and check for the ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but you haven't decided on a specific charity yet.
The busy programme of the President will, however, lead to a banquet, where there will also be a ministerial president and 250 other invited guests besides the Norwegian King and Queen.
Obama was rather slow from the beginning to the price.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just for him but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was "calling for action".
Protector of nature accused of blackmail
The Litomerice Police accused the president of the Civil Society of blackmailing the Society of Nature Protectors.
In several cases over the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal, he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said lithomeric police spokesman Alena Romová.
Lubomír Studniceka is the chairman of the Lithomerical Society of Nature Conservation.
Now he's in custody and he's been in danger for up to three years.
The thinning containers of Brno don't smell very good.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
You'll have to wait there for a few minutes before you find the proper dumpster.
I don't mean to say that waste wouldn't be treated at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that, as the second largest city in the Republic, the council is not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest range of sorting waste not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but especially the number of dumpsters on such waste.
Have you ever tried the center, for example, to throw PET bottles in a collection basket?
He's a complete friend, and he wants time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've hit so far is on Moravian Square across from Potrefené Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't feel like it.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste.
A lot of my friends don't do garbage like that.
From the lazy.
It's got a lot of ashtrays to it.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored dumpsters in sight on Kounic's street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on the way to the shed.
However, waste flowed from it.
It's still the center of Brno, which the city represents most, isn't it?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of Brno socialists are not very interested.
The city would rather buy a hockey extraliga, which would shame us all over the Republic than buy a few extra containers and offer to cut other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad that I could confirm the official statistics after a moment of Internet blurry.
According to EKO-COM's data, Brno is the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubkov" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After adding money to pensions, sickness or construction savings, the left hand may not be included in the budget, despite the opinion of the government to farmers or officials.
But also for interest on government debt or international litigation.
It will add problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted promotion to some groups, they relied on the government to lend additional loans to sensitive expenses, pensions or sicknesses. "It is just putting problems to the future, laying mines," Janota says.
Borrowed money pays more and more interest and sometimes has to come back.
The state doesn't have much choice where to take it.
If they do not reduce the social benefits or costs to the state, they must raise taxes.
To all those on the left now she has added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their kids.
Retirement or sickness, with 1.8 billion missing from the account, people don't have to worry about getting it.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted – next year it will not be missing 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will increase more rapidly and with him the interest costs.
The state will need money to pay it back, and it will no longer be enough to gently increase VAT or reduce the mother's income, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
As a result of the money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, there will also be five billion missing next year for the construction of motorways and railways.
These are mostly already tightened and divided sections, which are not to be redesigned and, where appropriate, cheaper.
At the very most, it's not free.
This means delaying or stopping 30 large buildings, and the use of European money is also at risk, the spokesman for the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, warns.
ČSSD suggested that the loss of money would resolve the Šalamunsky – it would reach the dividends of ČEZ, which it would become the majority of its own, and from them it would contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it's not a bottomless source at all.
Last year, the CEZ came into the budget of 18 billion.
On a yearly basis, the dividends shall be subject to the liquidation of environmental damage, to the addition of a pension account or to a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this is not the end of the movement carnival.
Almost three billion have been spent in the budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime or for spending on judicial disputes, even on construction aid.
If this money goes by, it's not safe.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or at worst to touch on the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the already implemented two billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is designed to allow online monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister didn't find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred in seconds to Android.
This is the option that the US company VMware aims at, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We'll allow you to manage two user profiles at once on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into homework and work.
Both will be working at the same time, indicated by Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first introduced a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of smartphones with two operating systems to journalists.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test the virtualisation of smartphones and should be available to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes don't only concern the Krkonoše wolfmen.
Missing snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Krkonoše they are still able to find free rooms for all winter terms, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a great visit to our site.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be snow or mud," said Spindl's information portal operator.
Whoever wants a New Year's Eve stay in Spindler Mlýn according to their notions should no longer hesitate to order.
Whoever prefers saving money and quality of accommodation is in second place, he can still try a few days to wait.
Spindler hotels have so far offered mostly weekly stays on Sylvester.
I think they'll try to give them up for a while, but then they'll let themselves go for a little while.
And then the rooms will be quickly occupied," Jandura estimated.
Free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Supreme Travel Office Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that's not sold out yet.
Half the seats on our offer remain open.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Director Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoše can offer the Supreme Travel Office as well, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first 14 days of February go well for the rest of the winter, and the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Krkonoše Mountains.
People wait for him to attack.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is better than last year to accommodate the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec under Snow.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few seats for New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and a good sale is also February," said the director of Karel Rada, the best hotel in Pec.
Of the 80 percent of Silvester’s stays are occupied by the Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, only half of the beds available remain in the latest Jano-Lazien hotel on Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by the January this year, which is now about 60 percent of our population.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow strikes, interest in stays in Krkonoše will certainly still rise, said Hotel Director Omnia Erik Sprysch.
However, for the greater part of the snow, the Krkonoše hoteliers must still taste.
On Thursday, it's supposed to cool down, and if there's any precipitation, snow should be on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorology Institute informed.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is comical, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he uses the word "like in Iraq" several times, but he did not even hesitate to use the name Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward".
Yet himself three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq under the control of civil war as "unresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decisions".
However, the following months have shown that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the Polish commanders was the only possible and very successful one, so much so that today they are not talking about Iraq at all.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was once again asked by the field commanders to raise the military contingent, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the co-ordination custom, severely criticised the hesitant White House shooter.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't feel any better, so at least he fooled the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to make a promise of another 5,000, even though he himself originally counted at least ten.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will produce the same fruit as the Iraq process.
Despite the murderous wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the deal.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are complied with.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are badly prepared to change their masters on a daily basis as they please.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only a village of Pomikin, where patriarchal tribal relations will continue.
The balancing of the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex in view of the lack of transparency of the relations that complicate even more Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even building an "actionable state", which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, does seem too realistic.
The Obama Strategy's time horizon blocks its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believing that soldiers sent to war screaming for the "fast return of home" will cause a miracle done here, can only the souls truly romantic, in fact intact.
From a political point of view, it is the date of withdrawal of the troops with clear irresponsibility, for the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
NATO's latest summit has shown that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is going to be negative.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war at the foot of Hindus.
Another factor that can be radically affected is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will rise to the overwhelming question of whether to try not to solve the problem by military force.
The answer will have to be answered just at a time when Obama says America will embark on the victory download from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential elections, and so there's still enough time left to come with another strategy if this turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers won't get any more cash rewards.
The senior executives of the US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive a share instead of money, which will be available for sale first in five years.
In addition, shares may be taken to managers in case they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is taking the lead in connecting Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued by former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after taking away nearly $17 billion (about CZK 300 billion) in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political theme in a number of countries as the financial crisis comes.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to impose 50 per cent of its taxes on bankers’ bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK).
France prepares similar steps.
This year, women won Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustaf's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature this year.
In addition to the four scientists, German writer Herta Müller was also a writer of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received the Nobel Prize for Medicine together with their countryman Jack Szostak for chromosomal research.
Israeli Ada Jonathan, together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the prize for chemistry for clarifying the structure and functions of the aquaculture industry.
The last laureate had Nobel Prize for economics won by American Elinor Ostromová and her native Oliver Williamson for economic governance analysis.
The only professional category that came in without a holder this year was physics.
This award was taken today by scientists Charles Kako for research in optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each awarded received a diploma, a Nobel Prize Medal and a financial reward certificate.
For each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more prizes in each of them, they share the reward among themselves.
Traditionally the most expected Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo by American President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his course and is also at the forefront of a country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to combat peace, even though the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering demis.
President Václav Klaus will adopt on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who considers the government's stay because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
The budget and perhaps even Janot's cabinet stay are expected to be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget criticises Klaus as well.
According to him, he has a very high deficit, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
He informed the president's spokeswoman Radim Okvat about the meeting.
Janota wants to talk about his next term as Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is about to receive for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed on the proposals of the left to move money and raised money to state employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government highlighted social democracy's proposals by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, there was a sharp intra-political dispute that started to raise questions about Fischer's next operation of the office cabinet at which ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has imposed in the autumn and which it believes will stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign, at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs, declared that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he's got a good solution today.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also rely on a wider political consensus, the president believes.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is terrifying and the government should consider further existence.
ODS President Petr Nečas told the Czech Republic that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens is clearly not working anymore.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek responded with words that a frightening deficit is the budget that the former Topolánk government has prepared for this year and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CzechSSD announced approval of the state budget for next year's success.
Humans were also satisfied.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's paper.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its fight and victory, despite some criticism that the major roles are played by American actors.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandel.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and its first black President Nelson Mandela in his life story is Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 19-year-old mandela asked if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
A 27 - year - old actor who won the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama of the Million Dollar Baby Box has already made the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in Divine Evan, but only rarely anyone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the title of the poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong on a worldwide scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to get Mandel's story on the canvas.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
Herac said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found that when I printed your hand, I took your energy, transferred it, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon is making a film called Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national football team, where white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was finally when he first met Piennaar at his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in actors’ characters compared to their actual drafts under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus received: Unbeatable positive reviews and ambitions of Oscar.
Daily Variety Film Critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the site rottenomatoes.com, Invitus received 76 percent of the positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway is fragmented: Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian borders were testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was once again unsuccessful and the shot was referred to as the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the boast of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, the boulder didn't take off or get injured in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" has already been described as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
The 13th attempt has taken place at first normally.
At the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the apparatus again.
Apparently, a third-degree rocket engine went off.
This time, "Bulava" started off the nuclear sub of Dmitri Donski, which floated beneath the white sea.
Because this type of missile allows the launch from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearby flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, since the first time, the Norwegians have not doubted that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that it is impossible to speak clearly about failure.
The first two levels of rockets survived, and the accident hit the third.
In previous cases, engines were broken in the first degree.
Even though not a single test start has taken place without error, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful in leading the defence ministry.
Thus, nearly 50 percent of the success of the generals fills with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it will even steal up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract in CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Vjacheslav Fetisov will again appear in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will assist his team, CSKA Moscow, in need, and will probably already be in the KHL Friday duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Dennis Kuljaš got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
All we need to do is solve some formal features, quote AP coach Sergei Nemčinov's Moscow Club.
So far, it's not clear if the comeback of the famous hockey player is going to be one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, he mentioned the Germans.
According to AP, Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to ice.
In the NHL he played for Hartford the legendary attacker Gordie Howe during the 1st century and signed 15 goals and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic golds, seven champions of the world, triumphed at Canada Cup and the junior world championship in the Soviet Union.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup in Detroit jersey.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai meets the union, cancels all overtime.
The management of Hyundai’s portable car has agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often-arranged overtime that the union announced Monday's strike emergency.
It was confirmed by Hyundai Petr Vaněk speaking cars.
However, the management wants to agree with the experts on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is essential, so it was proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday 19 December by making two shifts, Vaněk said.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company employees who perform Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
They get people back even on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanyk, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for overtime.
Either they pay the overtime fee or they can choose a spare time on December 28th, and by falling to extend the Christmas holidays for the day, Vaněk stated.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees get paid for their fare and lunch.
Since overtime was the most pressing and most passionate point in terms of comments and complaints by experts, even protesting employees who stopped production last week, management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel any overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Car employees were forced to work two more hours every day until last week, practically every day after an eight - hour shift.
Once the agreement has been signed, the trade unions shall withdraw the strike alert.
Further meetings between driving a car and experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Chef, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they would be ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck for constant overtime.
They also protested poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management suggested that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for car delivery.
In their Monday emergency report, experts also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, the company’s trade unions require that it ease the overtime work to a minimum.
Plus, they want to pay for it this year for 5000 crowns.
Hyundai’s portable car now employs 2,000 people.
The company launched a series production last November.
By this September, about 80,000 cars had been produced, and its current production capacity was 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: substance that also covers the 'sadden' viruses of HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of an improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already acquired against immunodeficiency medicines.
This fact in some cases predominates that the compound does not act as strongly as some medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the accumulation of HIV in the body.
However, a number of side effects are involved.
Incomplete suppression of the virus has, in addition, resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metal carbide act on protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metal carbonates are compounds of pine, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of pine, hydrogen and carbon are connected by metal atoms, in this case by cobalt.
Traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the fibrillation of HIV, it would not produce a maturely infectious virus particle.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic explain.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see Table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically changed.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents has been tested in the study and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallic carborates on the usual variant of enzyme is not as strong as in clinical drugs, but does not lose its effect on resistant variants against which medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments, thus makes an interesting compound for further research aimed at designing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS went into Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek named the approved budget for next year as "frightening" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The ODS statement was considered by the Prime Minister to be strong statements.
He said he's taking time to analyze.
ODS President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly not working anymore.
The Prime Minister of the Government must decide, according to the Times, whether he intends to rely in the House on a minority to combat the growing deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office by means of a parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas noted.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has raised money to the salaries of civil servants, to the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
At the same time, the government's surplus to the address of social democracy's proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, thus fulfilling the government's wishes that the revised budget is a less bad option than the budgetary commission.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still evaluate the situation.
The weather is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave office in case of acceptance of amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered a prime minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering further maintenance in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for the next fight against the budget deficit, they do not have according to the Government's Government Time to do what ČSSD nominees, which budget changes have imposed.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will submit a demis if the House approves further laws of deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: ODS nominees not guilty
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the text report from the United States.
He recalled that in several ministries, there are people in the deputy functions reporting to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
In time, he pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the higher deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct to rely on the left majority, which is currently in the House".
Then he says he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's over, I'm going to deal with it, I'm going to tell reporters in the House of Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated by the civil Democrats in the government.
Prime Minister Fischer left for Brussels this afternoon at a meeting of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister ODS
At the same time, he pointed out that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister of the Member of Civil Democrats specifically requested that the adoption of the budget be allowed.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question whether the presence of the party's president in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget was not an issue.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily the Bolsheviks of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new order of ČD, fewer trains will be driven by almost the same train
Since 13 December, Czech routes will cancel or limit some less burdened speeds and localities, while other connections will strengthen.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced by two per cent from the date of entry into force of the new timetable.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, do not change.
More possibilities of connecting to the capital are obtained, for example, by residents of Ostrava, the trails add a set of pendolinos to this track.
On the contrary, the speedboat will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less fast people will also go on the track Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the main limitation is the direct connection of Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, the main cuts in transport in the Královéhradecké region, a total of eight per cent, can be enjoyed by Prague and its surroundings.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and the operation of several speedboats on the track Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to just a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovički must cross over in Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban system of Esco, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will end at Prague Main Station.
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will travel at two-hour intervals.
Since 13 December, travelers will no longer be bound by Pendolin to Bratislava.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport is ordering and paying a total of four billion crowns for the so-called evident loss next year, as well as this year's four billion crowns.
This year's regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The locals and speedboats have a new ten-year contract, and so far the contract has always been for one year.
The track boasts the system, and therefore it seems that it has not reached the price hikes of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will be made only for day-to-day ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be further drawn from the crazy distance, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any of the regional cities and 160 crowns.
Filipino Armed Forces are still holding over 50 people, Children Freed
Today, armed forces in the South of the Philippines have abducted 75 people, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP, which originally reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in Agusan del Sur Province.
About 19 armed men say he's using hostages as a living shield to escape the police.
Local negotiators are now seeking to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Philippine Communist Party (CPP).
According to AP, the police were originally harassed by the kidnapper because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed has given rise to state law.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the November 23rd massacre in connection with the election to the governor's office.
The governor of this South Pacific province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested for suspected involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, peace talks were resumed with the Philippine government.
The JAR story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the following days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Invictus), which captures part of the life story of the former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid was hosted by Morgan Freeman, who was said to have chosen Mandela for his creation years ago.
Another male role of the legendary South African champion in rugby Francoise Pienaara was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the film taken, they emerge from critics and public voices
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rollahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Mves.
In 1988 he received Sakharov’s prize for freedom of thought, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
The President of the Republic of South Africa was in 1994-1999.
great expectations as it comes to the public at a time when, at the same time, preparations for the world football championship are high, but at the same time the media are shaken by disturbing reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination against residents by the Montenegrin ruling majority.
According to the AP intelligence agency, the announcements for the new JAR film have been quite positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations to the main roles of the Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his words for the new film.
I dreamt about that part for years and prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times, as they say, to pump his energy into the conversation after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind ourselves of Mandel's personality and message.
It's a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the uniform of the national rugby team
A picture based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that made the nation portrait of the South African human rights defender during his first presidential election period.
So during the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to embody two racial and long years of mutually defined population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays an acting role in South Africa’s national rugby jersey on the World Cup field, which was then won by JAR.
For entering the lawn in the jersey, which is considered almost sacred in JAR, Mandela cleaned up a large ovine of the white audience fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The Football Championships may be able to reunite people into one nation, said a rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
If the tense situation in JAR improves, it will only show up.
However, the white South Africans are skeptics, as an example of a recent interview with LN was given by a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
Tens of millions of crowns burn in Lounland
The fire caught the morning transformer of Chaps in a watershed near Vyškov municipality in Lounska.
In the fire, he intervenes according to the spokesman of the oral regional firefighters, Luke Marvan, six units.
Originally firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later the opinion was re-evaluated and fire fires mixed water, foam and special fire extinguishers.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal short cut, transformer.
No one was injured, according to the spokesman of Pavly Mandátová, there is no risk of safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few dozen million crowns, accurately numbering it after the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer according to Mandat will have to replace it with a new one.
Within ten years, nothing like that has happened to Chaps, the flaws of this type are unique, complemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected by the operation of households, offices or companies by the fires of the tram station, according to CEZ spokesman for the northern Czech Republic, Soni Holinger Hendrychov.
A.s. Ceps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as sole operator of transmission system, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 developed with 67 transformers converting electricity from transmission to distribution system and conductive routes of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will give criminal notice for conspiracy to three straight men from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today criminal charges against three social-democratic hatmen.
This is for Michal Haska from South Moravia, Radko Martínka from Pardubice Region and Haytman of Olomouc Region Martin Tessařík.
Jančura reported it at 20 minutes of Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
But all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech expensives.
All three Haytmans are attacking us and talking about picking raisins, and we only offered what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech roads, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech roads that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's for gossip to the student agency, according to Radio Journal Jančur.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they had not acted in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Mr Jančura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertising service for his company and his own person, is further considered by hashtag to be a continuation of criminal notification.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and my country and the same challenge as the other hatmen.
Even on this occasion, I suppose it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, Hashek said.
Jančura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will point out the unfavourable step of the regions.
The Radio Journal said it'll stop the Christmas campaign and continue after New Year's.
He stated that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Railways, and about 150 billion crowns did not sign up for a contract.
According to Janchura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur already threatened a member for ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't let it go, we can lose the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know what the master is talking about, I won't say his name, Radio Journal Jančur said today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcals since January brings down the normalities experienced.
It is intended to be free and optional for families first.
However, there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peaks.
The medical institute already determines the maximum price of the vaccine paid by health insurance companies.
Experts have already made the vaccination process clear.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August children
Since January, children born last August 2 and later can be expected free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier must pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
She had her children vaccinated against pneumococcals for a quarter of the family last year.
At the same time, the parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But they will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, about 500,000 a year has been given to the state for all of the pericardial vaccinations of children.
The so-called Janota package was introduced with the cultured vaccination.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain cells and poisoning of the blood.
At a pneumococcal infection, we will have up to 28 children under the age of 10 dead per year in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced well-established flat vaccinations for children against pneumococcals in 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that future vaccination might be mandatory.
Since January they are to be covered by insurance and compulsory.
For example, the head of the Civil Society, Naglas Rudolf Kalovský, indicated that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines has long promoted.
Experts at the international conference, which was attended by our association, were not fully satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to enforce at least this.
I think that's the path that we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we don't even think about it, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, says doctors
The Chair of the Professional Society of Practical Child Doctors, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that she has voluntary vaccination of her disadvantages.
If all children were to be vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of vaccinations "In the situation where this vaccine costs so much, we understand quite well the political decision that the vaccination was launched as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect that more than 80 percent of fresh parents will be vaccinated against pneumococcals next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also permeable in the fact that it is not a state as the first full-scale vaccination of children by health insurance companies.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, saving money for further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves.
However, there is concern about practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies substances for other vaccinations.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance companies could "deliver money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait for insurance companies to pay them off.
Individual practical child doctors are expected to invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, a significant amount.
It won't be easy at all, Cabrnoch says.
Son of an American artist 's been stealing in the museum'
The son of the renowned American creator of fiction, Frank Frazetta, was accused of attempting to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was found loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, was celebrated by the creation of the figures of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
By the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, according to Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr Frazetta's younger might have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger ad hoc statement, age 52, that he did so on the direction of his father "to get into the museum in any way possible and to move the images into the matching spaces", the agency said.
Mr Frazetta Senior has denied any such permission as the Agency has stated.
Labour avoids planned tax hikes
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "lost" opportunity to show that he is seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, the increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger over social insurance
The boards protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession that they did not blame and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - the increase is about 3 trillion pounds per year - which has upset the community of entrepreneurs who said it is a tax on employment, while it should focus on restoring the economy.
This increase, limited to more than £20,000 per year, affects approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY POINTS
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5 % from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen by 4,75 % this year than expected
New taxation of 50 % of banker bonuses
Increase of 1% tax on write-off companies in small companies
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind power plants
An increase of 2,5 % in pension measurement
According to the State Financial Administration, some revenue of £30000 will decrease by £90 per year and some revenue of £40000 will decrease by £190, while some revenue of £10000 will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure would be "a cap in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They are big numbers, which will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In its opinion, the decline in the economy was 4,75 % - far worse than the decline of 3,5 % forecast in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds over the next six years as insurmountable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, as might be the case, adding "Cynical" they postponed this decision until after the elections - which had to take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the chance to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory's proposals, who would like to reduce deficits faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money obtained by increasing taxes and reducing spending should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay the benefits in the next April - that this could lead to charges by the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was getting hard back a year later.
But laborers insist on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised on September n 2010.
Suspected Budget'
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists indicated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies said that Chancellor's figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the building.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," said Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the Reviror of Deloitte's accounts.
"That was the report on the suspicious preliminary budget, and the markets are implementing it."
FBI is investigating in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five American prisoners in Pakistan who are suspected of being connected to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for assaulting a house in Sargodar in the province of eastern Panda, as the BBC of the American Embassy in Pakistan reported.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who were declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs has also stated that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are mentioned as originating in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the other come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," spokeswoman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed about the arrest and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their starting here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncles of one of them.
It said that the house had always been the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had been brought against the arrested men.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, Reuters quoted the press agency as saying that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in expanding the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues in the recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced to their families at the end of November.
Rejecting amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The human rights situation in Iran has been as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, as reported in the Amnesty International Group's report.
The report describes in detail "tortures of torture" in the regime before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have described this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were imprisoned, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five persons to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests the highest leader Ajatolah Ali Chomejny declared that some forms of torture were wrong and that they were prohibited in the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our writer has stated.
Untruthful confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer scientist Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "work with Facebook networks" and protesting against election results.
"Frequently they beat me in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days he signed an untruthful confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Charroubi, was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied the rape charges, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container with another 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the electoral unrest and the government's reactions, but said that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were published.
The group stated that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn a monument in Bristol into a race course in Sisera.
The race course for the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the base track in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge 100 metres ahead of the Secessary track.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the Secessary track, but that it was really phoning.
It was a beautiful view of the shining lights of the city down there.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were awarded for the best bits - or manoeuvres on the Sisera track.
After the Thursday evening race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss electorate called after the ban on the construction of mines and there are generally alarming reports of the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether the Muslims could integrate - and integrate - into one of the most open secular societies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like scarves on their heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on issues that they have been dividing and employing the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have stated about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care for 5 . 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should Muslim enter the marriage union in a mosque or a town hall (or both places)?
Should young Muslim be taught the development and rights of gays?
can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interestingly oriented banking system if she wants to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly the world's controversial issues that are being discussed, which are part of daily life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others generally known, does not exclude Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are untrustworthy of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted the interview are drawn to the argument that it is the anti-polar of Selafi—suppliers of Purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which so strongly defends the lay public) are truly devoted to pluralism.
It is of the view that the Muslim faith is probably less experienced than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with the secular republic.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "screwing the screws of values".
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Uncomfortable Prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
Restricting ice hides alarming speeds, affecting animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, resembles the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Very familiar with complicated history and whalery practices describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to empower a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old swimmer who only fought with a pin of musket is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their dead mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, 75 polar bears performed suddenly in a circus tent.
Even today, gardens in the zoo are typically a million times smaller than that of an area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the holodrous hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt helicopters and Indians on skis and are all armed with powerful attack towels that shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it's happening in water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On Ice" Alumn Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortably responsible science for the Arctic and a serene summer view of how the future can change it.
Not everything is answered by scientists.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
It's for lack of testing.
The exploration roads of Friedtjof Nansen at the end of 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century indicated for the first time how floating ice moves.
Cold-war submarines then mapped moving over when they sailed.
Satellite research and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being carried out thanks to unrisked individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the fall system inside the Arctic ice created by the leaking of salt water, which is shrinking during the freezing.
But from the height of that bear to microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6,000 Marines have laid a wreath on the Arlington graves
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on a soldier's grave, with whom he had never met.
For him and the other members of the Marine Corps who made their way from the Johnson Camp in Jacksonville to North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to recover the graves, that was the day they gave up holding to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months when we board, it could be us, Robinson said about fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me the respect I'm trying to do.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the cemetery veterans in several departments during the Friday act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in a Friday act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorilla and his wife, Karen, take this road every year and stop in various cities along the road to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, a wreath across America, which they also believe in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths in the Arlington cemetery, on the territory of the Pentagon, on graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site of flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart has devoted more than $150,000 to buying and transporting wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had taken a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloths were volunteers walking through cemeteryes along the surrounding grasslands and hills.
Volunteers targeted the older graves of World War I and World War II and the war in Vietnam because these were not visited as often as the newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together while transporting the young pine tree to the pebble tombstones.
Each ring wreath was dark green with a small red arch bees upper part.
Close to 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is real silence.
The Joint Service Organisations devoted 1,000 wreaths to decorating the department, but the cloudy mood of the ongoing wars has filled this area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends stuck to each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names, carved into stones, while others bowed down to look at small black and white names, pressed into wet mud, where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit instead of the last rest of Sergeant David Shane Spicer's munition artillery sergeant, who fell in a fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single. . . my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
American government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials from the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on December 5th.
Certain charges have not been published, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical figures, pose a risk of incarceration.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but the authorisation was denied.
Detaining an American supplier could be a result of growing tension between the Communist Castro brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was seen as a "restraint tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They first reported a New York Times incarceration on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the united states will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in the country where the average wage of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by text messages because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba prison are behind bars for drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, U.S. Press Office for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide any more information about the prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American programme of the human rights group, who recently published an unfavourable report on freedoms in Cuba called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a hint of the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country and the compensation for poor older Brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would rather be political and that the Cuban government is often triggering a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are aiming for a wider dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants are spreading a conspiracy concerning the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities revealed the alleged leader of a conspiracy concerning the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops there, saying that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are stalking the Internet and looking for radicalized young men.
The investigators reported that they were looking for a gray insurgent personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men published a comment approving the terrorist attacks he had an online YouTube video page.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get into the remote Pakistani area of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in certifying al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped out after several days to the eastern part of Sarghoda, far from the horrendous mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a hit squad.
The reason why they were dropped was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the American Intelligence Service has given the highest priority to attempts at placing human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guardians, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits were subjected to a special examination at al-Qaeda, reported an analyst.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become more cautious in recent years in enabling them to join them, as American intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to proceed according to their recruitment model, which has been monitored so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one that is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Tens of thousands of protestors marched the streets this Saturday and demanded a more important climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Congress Center.
The protestors listed the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are saying that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists laid a few small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the small climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists were passing through the city and carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e. second-class) and one in Spanish, which said "Country says 'dost'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that she had travelled to her mother's parents in Peru and provided me with information about the unsatisfying state of the country in which climate change continues to affect me.
This is a partial reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
The police prevented protestors from approaching downtown Bella and said that she had detained 19 people, primarily because they had masks on or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who does not want to be identified, because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and placed several charges in black clothing near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located close to several ministries.
They were agitating at buildings, saying, starting with lights, but then there were "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
However, the protest was probably not brought to the attention of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether despite the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is really something I do not realize).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the stage is vast, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
The focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change is visible, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of scientific knowledge from mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education district of Colombia.
Although the district is far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils in the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest issues of the National Testimonial Center for Learning Progress are the continuing differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both local and national.
In the last two years, the average result of the four-year white pupils in the district of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but only three points have been raised for their African-American peers, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 57 points.
Progress with African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of the fourth grades in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the precinct was 60 points in the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result in both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly close.
In the last week, some district attorneys said that the results, celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more extensively stimulated in white students where high scores had already been achieved.
This would suggest that we have increased the range of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, CEO of the D.C. Voice, an unprofitable group that defends equality in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of a diversion of two or three points, said D.C. Quame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticising Mrs Rhee’s management style, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means high schooling in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious you always want to see the beams, and I respect it.
But what's terrible is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs Rhee said that the effort of the district is to continue searching for better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading bases, Wilson’s reading system, which focuses on students in higher grades of primary schools and students in high school who have not been able to master the basics of reading before in their knee careers are significantly behind their peers.
Daily mathematics and the basis for the teaching of mathematics in the sixth grade, stressing the games and experiences of real life that got into the district as former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be added to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and perform the best interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others pointed out that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain winning dilemma for Mrs Michel Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where she studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus on the resources and administrative reforms for schools located in the worst parts of the district of Columbia.
That way, focus can bring political lessons that target an important agenda.
However, the surplus also includes other city directors who are trying to maintain a medium diameter between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on excellent public education for their children.
Mr Janey, the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to achieve the rightness of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to enforce the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers to be a "symptom" to seek a greater increase next year.
Making Higher Education a Part of a Better Future
A bus drove to the Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green grasses.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from El Salvador High School.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the soil of the dormitory.
Now, she and other eighth grade students in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school was $38690 a year, their position was rather than the intimidation of visitors to the enthusiasm of potential students.
That's it! she called Graciela, who would love to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the knowledge building.
Wow, really? Rules thoughtfully, when they gave them a low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited their class tour and were now fully interested in the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where it came from.
However, this is a portentous problem with the high number of children born to Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or are pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will receive further education and so will enter the middle class.
In fact, five of this "spiritual generation" of Spanish students from the dormitory - remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and Central American residents, have reached the United States without completing a university.
Their success story is important, they tell researchers because it undermines their point of entry forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have reached higher education say that they had a natural affection for school and innate breakthroughs and efforts to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American schooling.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts persist in time.
In view of the fact that children come from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them get to know each other in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not resolve it, says Patricia Ghandara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a network of preschools in every way to leave high school.
The federal program, which financed Graciely's tour of the railways, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (to build up), it provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to run further training programs that start for students from small income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraq's Oil Industry Ministry reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to force important oil companies to rebuild their infirm infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have left with capital participation in exactly two of the 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was irritated in June.
The direct involvement of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have first place on the road Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
That'll be long before something else is in Iraq for sale.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated Tuesday bombings and political instability, as well as U.S. Army withdrawals, are likely to discourage US companies from a much more intensive enterprise in Iraq, which has a proven third largest stock reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies have been at a disadvantage, especially the Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contact with the Iraqi Ministry of the Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The National Petroleum Corp of China participated in more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic one, as well as the technological power, said the secretary of the oil industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will be in compliance with its obligations to Iraq.
Companies selected for submission of tenders which were then compared by the Ministry at the price for barrels and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current levels in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
With the impact of the American rocket at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was apparently killed by the top al-Qaeda operative planner, as U.S. counter-terrorism officials announced on Friday.
It has been confirmed that this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed on Thursday on their car near Miran Sáh in the province of Northern Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have discovered that missiles were launched from a non-mannered aircraft operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were indicated on a white car heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, along with the Pakistani civilian intelligence agency, who telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local armed forces had drawn to the point and quickly entertained what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying that Somalia was post-mortem.
Somalia was listed as a highly-built al-Qaeda military operations planner who ran terrorist groups operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the establishment around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who described the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the highest leadership of Al-Qaeda and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another American official said that Somalia quickly progressed in the hierarchy of al-Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a public figure for some Americans, but he did not demean himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant faction in the indigenous tribe band and three other supreme operational leaders.
The pace of attacks initiated by the CIA using drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two, according to the Long War Journal, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for improving the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people suspected to be informants.
The supreme delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
The United Nations High Representative in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and end such a turbulent term of office, which was marked by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure occurs because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US time schedule to reduce the situation, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their strength.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The accepted commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not giving up, but that he was simply fulfilling the promise that he made to his family in March 2008, that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look after the follower, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started seeking compensation.
Officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Mistura, who had Swedish-Italian origin and formerly led a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a French man who had previously conducted a United Nations peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the earthly presidential election for masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said the Galgraith indictment -- which was released -- "has definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism in view of international intervention" in the election.
Eide stated that he had proposed a meeting with the High Representative of the Citizens to coordinate efforts to lead the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also arranged for the United Nations leadership to allow his successors to hire more United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the UN's difficult recruitment regulations undermine her ability to use her skills.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon be imposed on Iran "other significant sanctions" due to a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week’s journey to areas where they were fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, had bogged down prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an indescribable unpredictability in war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also be achieved by ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and restraint" would require "to force the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people will be particularly affected" by sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In his talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a substantial part of his supply of enriched uranium in exchange for the fuel urgently needed for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has taken the stand for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the provisional agreements -- partly because of this, the expert states, because the Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, with regard to Iran's hardness towards the international community in the case of certain proposals that he really agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set the final deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Foreign Minister, once called "destructive sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission at the United Nations condemned Thursday what it called "unsubstantial and unfounded accusations" to some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue its talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the Kurdistan area rich in oil to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
High tensions persist between Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, in particular due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent the US from retaining its plans to limit the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to quell Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. US official sites quoted Gates as saying to Massoudu Barzaniya, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your safety, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an aging China, a change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One additional child means one additional grave".
Then they were taught that when the official government in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and the ageing population in their town, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their reactions were immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't keep anything for others, says Wang, 31 years old, the administrator of human resources, who has an eight-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China's policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and twisted children, effectively dubbed "small emperors", the country is threatening the population crisis.
Average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per pair compared to six compared to that of the UN, as reported by the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the population is 60 years old and above, is forecast to increase sharply from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
There are more rich coastal cities with higher education populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said, many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportions of ageing populations and reduce the number of workforces in the future".
He says it's about being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradually calming down
As it was invested in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate ever established under the Communist Party's rule.
The two who have violated politics have faced tremendous penalties -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts have promoted a policy that has helped the country to prevent the critical flow of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion during the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male ratio to women.
In recent years, the public officials have gradually been milder in their opinion of a child’s policy.
In 2004 they generally allowed exceptions - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were onlyees - and in 2007 they eased the diction of their tough lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, as a way for couples to have two children if one of the partners was the only one.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight there were posters encouraging parents to have only one child, replaced by copies of a regulation detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and drag flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
Reactions were cold, family planning officials reported.
The Compressive Response
Although officials in a rural town around Shanghai have recorded an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign, most district districts have not reported changes.
Huinan city district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign the number of births in the city in 2010 was still only expected around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Yuanjuan, 26, said that she would like two children and was legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a definitive capture network, the choice could be irresponsible.
Westerners view the policy of one child as a wrong question, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in a union with her first child during the seventh month.
Yes, we were crippled by the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the administrator of human resources, says that they only want one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the focus of our families and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care, and in fact we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is flying the translation society, expressed this much more inconclusively.
For the middle - class two - career parents who had reduced childbirth, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds view parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of food for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parental time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions for the propstor -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You have to have resumas ready at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisciplined positions and mutual counselling -- again on Friday, it focused on releasing the document, which proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as it highlights the way forward.
But there was important progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Established by the UN working group ad hoc, this text makes clear how much money rich countries should provide for those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of key issues elections, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit on global temperature growth, which will still be able to tolerate political actors.
This supplies the process with a high dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief representative of the Sierra Washington Club.
Michael Zammit Cutatar, who proposed a six-page document, described the 180-page text from the negotiations to focus on what a top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It paints outline for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent per year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
On Friday, the European Union speeded up its promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poor countries adopt adaptations to climate change -- from flood and drought to deforestation.
But he still listed the same type of verbal fireworks that prevailed during the interviews last week.
US Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected a speech requiring binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrial countries compared to volunteerism for the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that Obama's administration established a tougher line against China, the Bush administration's officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US Chief Negotiator about climate issues that either lack of "salt sense" or "emergency irresponsible" had led earlier in the week to the announcement that the United States would not have helped China financially so that it could deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world's major powers at stake, the pulleys broke out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mainly about maintaining individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the two tens of the most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative for carrying out more important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation of Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while the vulnerable countries had become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor for regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main actors have said that the best outcome of the talks will be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "promoted a political pusher on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The meeting called for a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government had an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Rames and Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and ran the halls of the Bella centre to closed meetings and new conferences so that they could determine the rights to be assessed next week.
The total size of the assembly - when 13,000 people moved from and to the congress centre daily, guitars played by activists staged in the night ironic views of the countries they thought they had sent, and there was hand-in-hand hand-in-hand motions on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on the center of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
There's heavy weight coming in.
British first train at 140 miles per hour predefined this Monday feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning the whistle cut the darkness at the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford to Kent to St Pancras in London and exceed 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal suite outside of London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Limited standing water should reduce transport times in personal transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties were allowed to obtain this vision.
But tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a viable study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
It provided a detailed map of the routes of the next planned high-speed network stage.
A new route of London's connection to Western Midland was proposed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where life-centred areas could be problematic.
In the open country, a final route of up to 25 m was planned.
HS2 also expects to identify three choices for a large high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is the configuration of the form Y, where one high-speed line should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle above Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most effective choice has taken place," said the railway expert.
As soon as it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour present.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already designed to carry trains of 400 m long and capable of transporting 1,100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to capture the high-speed network.
Railway experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes or does not intend to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken before general elections.
Even if he puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed lines, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an orientation point for the revolution on the railway.
Tax collectors paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the owner of the Tory front bench in the House of Representatives, paid thousands of pounds of expenses last year for an orange that he built in his house in the election district.
The spokesman for the prison, who was demolished by David Cameron for complaining that the Members had lived "out of rations", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a oak-coated extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims in due time and so were not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the control of the Member States' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan made his demands "it was easier or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-story houses for all in his election district Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor is the kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial authority has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is labeled "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe her as "a glass for fun and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not requested to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the supply security to a mortgage of £271406 from his property in London to a house in his election district, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1400 pounds a month for the mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payment fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, leaving a balance.
The latest document by the municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued his claim of £1250 a month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret vice president filmed it and said that Members must survive the "indeed" after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on a ration and treat you like fuck."
He said, "I spent my money in my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what was necessary.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I'm not gonna do it."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as a oil dealer, was first called on to explain his editions in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was discovered that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked about the increase in the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authority and later by Legg."
He added: "this is not a disputed question of hiding and clicking or violating rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, entitled and that's all.
It wouldn't be much different ways cleaner or simpler."
Come and see the cottage on the Brighton coast with an adventure calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulates the spiritual exploitation of creativity has called on 24 owners to win their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas bikes as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop’s bread and welded wine, provided free.
Selected collections included I Saw Three Ships, About Come, About Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant to television marketing from Howe, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester Diocese and Head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post - Christian society.
"Why should we expect people to come to another's old building as a church? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an uplifting way.
"The idea of an adventure calendar in cottages was just created as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding deal to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organisers have manifested in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the United Nations climate conference, which aims to reach an agreement on Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, said that the increasing global mobilization, with clear evidence of current manifestations, would have contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to an AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 black-dressed demonstrators began smashing the exhibits with stone cubes and hammers.
The law enforcement force immediately stepped in.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradical separate groups that appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France.
Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no matter" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting "pretained in the streets on Saturday night" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to break in.
For the speakers, a stage was set up for the spiritual meeting of the candles at the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protestors came by bus and train from major European cities, and besides Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cloaks, formed their first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpilová, the Filipino Warrior of Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on saying, "It's time for that," said the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses dry up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the struggle for another world has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the elements of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first events began in the Asian-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people came out of the streets according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves of evolutionary importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators came out of the street demanding a strong response to climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille, South, Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east), attended protests organized by the 350 movement.
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazie has elected her president, Georgia condemns it as a "frak"
Abkhazie elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares this step a "frach".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polls closed in 17 hours of GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, the participation was a few hours before the closure of the polling rooms was 58%.
The first preliminary results should be released from Saturday night on Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagaps, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia which condemned these elections.
These choices are a fraction.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michal Saakashvili "pity that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgalage.
In addition to Russia, the independence of the territory was recognised by 216,000 people only in Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After a division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhaze tries to demonstrate through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, according to the newspaper AFP Quarchia Svetlanová, 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapša.
She was one of those who came to the election room in the school in the capital of Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country, with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are located next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful election process awaited a warm reception by the district mayor of Beslan Arshba.
"We, Abchaz, are grateful "we said at a small ceremony, with the support of Moscow in mind and in particular its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovskij, a member of the Russian Parliament, and drank vodka for it.
The opposition, represented by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbo and two traders Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, criticised the contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhaze railway network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
To win the election you need a half-dozen majority 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this result, the decisive match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding deal to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, was demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organisers manifested in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which is hosting until 18 December delegates from 193 countries concerned with an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly went towards Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to break in.
For the speakers, a stage was set up for the spiritual meeting of the candles at the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in wholes in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break up the explosions.
The law enforcement immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, while several manifestos hit the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and stated that it was mainly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France.
In the late afternoon, one police officer was injured with a stoneboard and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents that resulted in about 20 people being detained by police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most protesters who came by bus or train from major German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cloaks, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpilová, the Filipino Warrior of Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the elements of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam called a number of known personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first events began in the Asian-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people came out of the streets according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and scarves of evolutionary importance of solar energy, manifested themselves in front of the headquarters of the capital city of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for strong measures against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille, South, Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east), attended protests organized by the 350 movement.
A few dozen people met in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general high school, Chatel said.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" in the reform of general high school, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all students will have a second year of four hours a week and for all will be the same program of general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because according to him specialization S is no longer focused on exact science, but "in essence there are the best students".
The EC’s and L’s specializations cannot be with any sub-specialisations, it continues and emphasises: “I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have made it difficult for them to learn geography and history in the last year of professional high school”.
A survey by the agency Ifop, which published on Saturday the daily Humanity, showed that seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government project to abolish compulsory history and geography education in the senior year with specialisation S, and that is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this waiver, both left and some members of justice.
On the contrary, the minister added that "not taken into account" to cancel philosophy in the specialization programme of the senior year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in education of teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trades) called for participation in Tuesday mobilisation against this project, which according to them offers pedagogical education for future teachers of high school.
In the course of Master's Study 2 (M2), he will start the year with an exam focused on their field and at the end of the year an additional study to verify their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of Master's degree and the first year will be in front of the pupils as an intern professor.
If you count all the internships offered before the reception, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is not yet in national education.
He reconfirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite university, the École normals of superieure have experts for 15 minutes to convince them about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the International Panel of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) on the initiative of Ecole University Normal Superieure on Ulm Street, on Saturday morning.
According to one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would have a greater desire to learn something more, he explained on the occasion of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local lake, which the students thus named.
About 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and the selection is based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared remarks, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen Conference relies on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the web school as of 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delay: Angry guards in prisons, planned measures
The Prison Supervisors' Committees announced on Friday 'general mobilisation' because they demand that they be paid premiums and overtime for financial reasons, which were postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Superintendents) requested staff members who would not have the service to participate in the demonstrations held Tuesday morning before the prison facilities, and to "block" them and thus point out "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd sectors of this sector) has called for "to convene meetings in individual prisons and start essential mobilisation" with the fact that it is "stricken and unacceptable" that "times and allowances for work at night, Sundays and holidays" held in October are not paid in December.
The First Committees of Supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "call for overall mobilisation (...) with a view to expressing dissatisfaction and resentment".
The Directorates of Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime in 2009 increased considerably and not all included in the financial budget, but ensure that debt amounts will be paid in January.
The office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent messages to the branches of the prison supervisors, in which she assured them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts that the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her communication.
I ordered the Directorate-General of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that has arisen in the future has never been repeated by Minister Alliot-Mariová.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive the glorious premium for performing their functions and fulfilling their objectives, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "the budget always finds a place".
It is simply a scandal, a heated inter-regional FO union in Marseille, and announced its decision to boycott the appeal of "all meetings and appeals".
Employees won't come to work on Sunday or on holidays unless these days of October are paid in December as well as during overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they give us more and more jobs without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow those lowest employees to pay for it, according to CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of them are better than others.
However, in any case, the funds, since few, were stated by Secretary General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he gets
American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided that "the goddess" of Oprah Winfrey screen, that as far as gifts are concerned, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday night at ABC Station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-legged family partner gets his booty.
Jesus likes Boa, too, said Michelle Obama with the fact that the doggy will also "of course" receive a gift as derived from the passages from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also argued against her husband's claim on the quality of gifts that she gets: "Well, certainly not, I gave you a good gift last year," she teased the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after with humor he pointed his finger at the pearl necklace of the first lady: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-day very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also spoke about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree transmission, but also a basketball that was dedicated to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he met very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas, and the way he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
After a long time, I realized that he was the one who gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I settled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday re-opted, RTL says he's in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to the "injury" caused by the larger operation he performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL stated that the singer was in an artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors said that the "injury resulting from the operation" of the sawmill which he had performed in Paris on November 26th, said in Paris of his press department, that these lesions required a "repair operation".
However, the press department of the singer tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that new medical communications would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the lead partner of the singer of the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes we'll have a little bit more certainty, he adds RTL.
The press department, at the request of AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris, according to "some sources".
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a fearsome fence.
The surgery, which was scheduled several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Deliaux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that occurred after the attack.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye said on RTL on Thursday that his boyfriend is just going through "bad times", but added that he's "not worried" about the rocker because it's a big "warmer".
He called me just before he left for L.A., but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation was no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, he calmed down the situation of the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, a singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only accumulated since July, when he was hospitalized nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "little thin intestine tumor" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour " Tower 66", which was presented as his bachelors.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving to the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to demente again the report on new hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the big pool, won the European 2009 championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, at which the combinations were last allowed, fell only three world records, although many more were expected.
One of them was defeated by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m position race and two remaining men's staff Russia to 4x50 m position race.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who made a glimpse of the world record in a 50m free way, which is already the holder of the large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with the final time of 20,53 seconds in the final, at which the ten swimmers were launched prime ministerly instead of the regular eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Dragagno (20,70) and Rus Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20.30), he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record in my range, I'll try for it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combines helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time did not help the Germans Paul Biederman, the double world champion in a large swimming pool in summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record that holds the 400m free way (3:32.77), but still won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian racer Nikita Lobintesev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I wasn't gonna beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title, and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: The board of the Romani sarcophagus belonging to Zolo was auctioned at $1.5 million
The board of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which did not belong to anyone other than French writer Emil Zola, was auctioned at $1.5 million on Thursday, which is much more than was estimated to be said by Sotheby's art dealer.
The price of this two metres long and 63 cm high front plate, from the third century C.E., was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four delinquent scenes in the elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satire and baccarat is a rare work, there are very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," AFP said on Tuesday, Florence Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The deal was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still under way, but it is an item that was most credited to by AFP spokesman Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emile Zola took this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then appeared gradually with the French actress Cecile Sorelová, who decorated her bath in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before the Council took office in March Petain.
She's been shaded in there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered during the search of the Museum database in Louvre that this board was part of the "remaining of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, the year after the death of author "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
The interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico ruled that the conditions for the transfer of overthrown President Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, and the rebels refused to grant a guarantee of safe departure.
After the phone call that I had with President Zelaya last night, it all points to the fact that there is no way to carry out this transfer, the Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew back to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, reported the source of the Directorate General for Migration.
The desert government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demis" and to request political asylum abroad only to give him a chance to leave safely.
But the overthrown president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The government of the deserts "have experienced another failure when they wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to give up the demis", Zelaya said radio Globe on Thursday, where it often speaks to a political crisis that has lasted five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, he added a deformed president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalp for two and a half months, and he played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico asked us to guarantee safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Minister of the Interior of the Desert Government said on Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur Station, which has headquarters in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized at the center of the centurion of the deposed president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the purgatory government.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who came close to Socialist President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, was overthrown on 28 June on the day he organized, in preparation for his re-election of public consultation, against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned to the 21st century and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of there, he'll be arrested and he'll be responsible for the crime of treason, which he's accused of, the desert government claims.
On November 29th, Justice President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won the Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. business balance suggests optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and US trade balance shows rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on the U.S. trade balance numbers, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade balance deficit dropped by 7.6% in October versus September, to $32.9 billion.
On the other hand, analysts expected a step - up.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment increased against all expectations and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "at the lowest this year," said Scott Marcoiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also declined.
The profit of a state treasure with a view of 10 years increased to 3,482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the yield of 30 years increased to 4,492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime were saying "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred Cuban supporters were extorted by political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented the further manifesto arrested by dozens of dissidents.
About 40 "Lady in White", wives or close political prisoners were printed directly on the street by Raul Castro moderators on their march towards the centre of the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist informed.
Away with the Yankees!, "The Thieves!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" chanted the bulwarks of the dissident regime.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came in to "safeguard security".
The day before, there was a similar manifestation against "Ladies in White" in Havana, but there were no injuries, no arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents were detained by the civilian police, who were also planning to manifest themselves on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, according to an AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police forced dissidents who were extorted by government officials into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions lasts only a few hours from the rule.
The holders of Sakharov's 2005 European Parliament Prize, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "the release of everyone, according to disentum, about 200 political prisoners", stated one of their leaders, Laura Pollanová, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "soldiers" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's manifesto against "restors of the Revolution" in favor of the government regime.
Cuba, with the Communist Party in charge and the one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of non-respect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the time of their peak Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an eighty-year-old man at or before the pharmacy, 85 Boulevard Jean-Joures, that is the police and witnesses version.
A seriously injured old man, born in 1929, died under the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital for injuries.
In or before this pharmacy, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband of about 30 years of age began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources the vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was moved to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source put it, then fled to the street, still at Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He hurt two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
As all this has happened, it is not clear, for all things took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that carried the cross behind his back, said at the site of the Alliance's union leader in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to the testimony of the gathered AFP.
I saw some 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd threw him, including one of the city police officers who broke his wrists, added.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Joures, at the level of 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by fists, reported a police source.
There was an incident in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The neighbors came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I went out and I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big abdominal wound, I told AFP Frederic Allione, a 30-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second about 30 - year - old person who also had stab wounds with a knife came out.
A man who didn't have ID on him was arrested by the state police.
The State Attorney in Nanterre handed over the matter to the Regional Police Investigation Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspected assailant was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source didn't rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "outside himself" as "all madmen of this type whose strength in action increases tenfold."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for an end to criminal prosecution
Polish-French director Romana Polanski requisitioned Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop a criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence for an antsy that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director's attorney for the film "Pianist" criticized the three judges of the second district court in California for serious error in the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, said counsel Hummel and added that from the conduct of the judge who then ruled, Laurence Rittenband "had a cold in the back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) allegedly had to deal with the prosecutor before he had been sentenced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information on this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the state attorney himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared by the end of September that "he lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will request a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what was already said at the first state, because there will be no serious examination of the application for a stay of prosecution until Roman Polanski is brought to trial.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruling on "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never again entered the territory of the United States.
The prosecutor's deputy in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
In this case, we want to speak not only to Romano Poleski, but also to another accused that it is possible to escape? Ask Mrs Asayam.
It is the view that the director "asks court favor and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take the decision also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't alone in asking to stop the prosecution of Romana Polanski.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also asked for an end to the prosecution again.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case arose and added, "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on the orders of the United States of America on September 26th in Switzerland
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a home prison in his shack in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible confession.
Wall Street ends with no direction, he's being stopped by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday with no direction, the market dives between indicators that are better than expected and rising dollar prices in the United States: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, reported Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of the trade has decreased very much, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve the mood on the market in terms of economic recovery stability", the analyst Charles Schwab summed up.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, a second month after each other and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers has also returned and in December increased to 73.4 against 66.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes have been hampered by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which has been highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology shares lose land under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of the state treasure, with a view to 10 years, increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening, and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4,492% on the day before.
Miss World's election back in South Africa.
After a month's journey across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are about to exceed the goal of achieving their dream: to be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great beauty celebration took place in the second year around Johannesburg, and for the time being, five candidates gained the process to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasakiová, Perla Beltran Acostaová from Mexico, Mariata Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbert and Yanbing Maová from Canada were selected during their African stay Miss Sport or Miss Top Model.
It was a true belief of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so much experience! Miss Sierra Leone has confided.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after 9th, will be broadcast in direct transmission from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 17th hour (15th world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful land in which to lay my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have experienced it twice, I confided to Miss World Xenia Sukhin, in the hot summer of the south.
For young Russia, her second visit to the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "a country that is pouring out of breath".
After months of performances, trials, meeting with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the contest itself.
Indka Pooja Chopraová hopes to go in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in Aishwary Rai's election, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood's stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty of South Africa Michelle McLean and chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
The South African Republic has shown itself to be able to welcome the world with the heat that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates also participated in safari last year, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could have met people I never dreamed of.
I'm sure I'll go back to the 2010 World Cup, says with enthusiasm Miss Italy Alice Daddy.
According to David's son, the report on the state of Hallyday is "very positive."
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us at his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday when he took off the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after the 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, declared that "as soon as possible" would arrive at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where John Hallyday was admitted on Monday because of the post-operative infection caused by the operation of a wary interfaith fence which he had undergone on November 26th in Paris.
According to a press release, the night was played in Los Angeles because of the comfort of "putting into an artificial sleep", which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, already in an artificial sleep. Hospitalization was due to an infection following the operation of a heated interfaith fence performed on November 26th in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-opted from Wednesday to Thursday at night.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a French lyce school performance Friday morning in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade.
The advantage of the orthopedic surgery and traumatology department of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catony, reported that he flew to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on Clinique internationale du Park Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles said they were upset, according to M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday" went too fast to Los Angeles by authorizing his Paris surgeon".
Personally, I spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which I was very surprised to find, since I had already suffered twice with the invertebrate, he added.
A moment earlier, at the RTL radio station, he said that the singer had apparently flown after a Paris operation with no drain, with nothing to do."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in artistic circles.
He operated on Maria Trintignant's actress in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on Charlotte Gainsbourg's actress to remove the haematoma that resulted from bleeding to the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, repeatedly convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber, Olivier Metzner, described him as "a man without scruples", who is "rightly" called in front of the medical chamber, and which can't even be "very recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday to the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the procedure had been "very good," and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore it was not necessary to introduce the drain," he added.
The health problems of the singer have been increasing since this year, and in any case, it seems that his other tours remain with the question mark.
It is obvious that the date of the renewal of the planned tour on 8 January (In Amenes, Poz. red.) appears to be too close, Camus declared.
The UDF increases the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to continue not taking their shortcut.
On Friday, the UDF, controlled by the MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, responded to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin to seize the shortcuts of the former Giscardian party by not using the shortcut in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own the UDF with the fact that François Bayra did not deserve her inheritance after he had given his hand to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is the partner of the UMP, was scheduled to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Member Hervý de Charetta (formerly a-UMP now for NC), who attributed ownership of the UDF brand because it was first registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004 (l'Institut national de la proprieté Industrie).
But on Friday night, the UDF Committee of Friends-controlled Françoise Bayrou, who had no intention of letting themselves take over, stepped out of his silence and formally requested the Minister and Members to stop using the shortcut and return the property of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statement that you will propose to take over + the UDF’s shortcut + the UDF’s shortcut, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by Modem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centrist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan + UDF today+, the letter markers also state.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this shortcut, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to remove all UDF names from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
The letter states that the UDF "is a legitimate political movement since 1978" and points out that Mr Morin and his friends "elected" leaving in 2007 to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to set up an UMP.
Therefore, the Nouveau Centre has no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they point out that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to create a committee entrusted with defending the "moral and material interests" of the Valéry Giscard d'Estaing association.
As for Hervé de Charette, the Committee continues, "when he registered a trademark", he was not "for three years a member of the UDF", but an UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This tactlessness begins to become a crime, they declare, and then with irony they express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in normal life it is more valuable to create a name for themselves than to emerge from anonymity by taking names that we do not have the right to."
The Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for the abuse of the condition of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre court decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to rule on whether he used the state of weakness of an eighty-year-old billionaire to save her from her property, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blamed him for.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his famous photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of the state of weakness, which is a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that a process will actually take place in a cause that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, where mothers with their daughter are attacking each other and fighting for the management of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be conducted by a college of three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 while expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think he'll step on it.
I'm going to talk to her about things, she said after the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman.
Regarding lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent report(...). Experts show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It is the two years that the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who is accused of using her mother's weakness for years to gain billions of euros in cheques, life insurance contracts or masters' paintings.
So Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be a photographer, whom she considered to be a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to assess the right of action filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday lawyer's speech changed at the family's hour of truth.
Lilliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, expressing her distrust of his husband, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier for 15 years once or twice a day.
I've never been able to talk to Françoise since she got married."
The State’s Office in Nanterre again found that the complainant’s proceedings were not justified, more so that the guardian judge these days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in court, is not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will act for her," confirmed prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers would be in favour at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been unnecessary...
For more than ten years, the management of large companies has been reminded of the attitude of companies towards employees towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for co-workers to identify with the 'values' determined by the mountains, as was the case when the consumer had to impose products that had emerged from the ideas of factory technicians.
By being the center of business companies, the customer compared the marketing revolution with the marketing strategy of acquiring the market in the right direction...even if authoritarian efforts to force products different from customer preferences are regularly returned!
The passive approach of employees can lead to a fatal demoralisation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly affects the managerial cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires from all parties involved (...) the active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires employees to make commitments that are totally contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a management revolution, which should aim at placing workers at the centre of the company's interest as well as a client.
Relative utility of internal public opinion surveys.
Internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it always did after different turns!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing proportionally with the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering colleges, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of the thought of comfort, they acquire an old behavioral theory, now re-animated "neurologists" from the United States and widely disseminated without any greater knowledge of the scientific institute and the media.
With the possibility of moving the levers (sic) of involvement of managers, the recent survey by Ipsos agency on Figaro.fr, which only reinforces the management staff in their mechanical management position, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilisation.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises foresees the adoption of a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a basic observation into all the purposes and practices of management : Employees will be able to only make commitments to the company if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation deals only with studies Motivatively functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they value their businesses on the basis of a predetermined dox to enable them, through the image that they describe, to assess what they offer to achieve their objectives in life.
Through identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performances" and introduce their human resources management "on the right path".
This creates a vital soil for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama earned praise from the right.
The American rights on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who first mocked Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse of the right republican wing, for the U.S. daily Today, and added that it itself expressed itself on the subject of "sometimes necessary" wars in its memories that are just coming up.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans would want to do at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the sending of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used his speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Obama's next opponent, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president took "very good work" to Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, and the former President of the House of Representatives congratulated him, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be quite historic, declared Gingrich during the interview on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see the "left president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor Washington Post, Obama presented "a very American speech".
Not only did he present himself as a "holyman" as always, but he "spoke as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson evaluated.
Among the few dissatisfactions in the line of rights are the hawks of the Bush era, former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, who described the expression as "single, bloated and without inspiration", as he said on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of force.
"When we wrap the war into the envelope of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the centre-left press has a commendable position towards the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the peace price to Obama premature, it considered his performance as "excess" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to an international solution to conflicts, in combating poverty and oppression," says the California daily.
Obama "explained what kind of speech was needed", evaluated the New York Times, and marked the speech "as simple and instructive".
Road carriers: three marathons for an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, road hauliers and TLF, the only employers' organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement Friday evening, ending the call for strike and threat that hung over the delivery of supplies at Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even so, three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of meeting, which began at 11 o'clock, for everyone to agree and at 18 o'clock to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would have hurt businesses very much" and "would have threatened to disrupt holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase of 4% in the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight we're giving our members orders not to go to any blockades, no blockades of supply centres.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "the right deal", although it was difficult to admit an increase in high wages due to international competition. "
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement and respect for employees, said CMAXIM Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% rebalancing of travel expenditure and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of 100 million euros in corporate tax" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft budget law for 2009, which was voted on from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "conciliation" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, later on to the whole sector, if the Ministry of Labour extends.
Bussereau will be assured "as soon as possible".
The whole process can only hamper the disapproval of employers' organisations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "has been offered to the sector in the context of compensation for part of carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to do emergency work, not because of mutual analysis, but because of the fact that he did not exasperate turkeys at the time of the upcoming Christmas feasts, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement over the next 12 months "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
Freight trains RER A: breakovers on weekends, trade unions not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the RER A rail line, which is the largest link of public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the boards and the conduct of the RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the issue of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will ride only between 10 and 20 hours, at the main section (between La Défense and Nation) will ride every other train, outside this section just one train of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Business houses Galleryes Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP has tried to ensure connection with large commercial houses".
The RER A link leads from the west to the east of Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was a train running in peak one out of two and virtually no set-up was driving at the time off peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France took a different position and there was no confusion at the platform.
So early in the morning there were many fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because there were students and students missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he had risen up "an hour and a half early to be sure he would arrive on time".
Saint-Lazare Station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railway was announced, as an increase in the number of administrators and guardians of the Order was predicted.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station with the connection to the metro.
Further general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with the leadership, which the unions have considered as "weak".
The RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, working-time adjustments, careers etc.
This is not the case, however, with Thierry Garon (Jih Committees).
The RATP even put forward proposals for the premium for the time being, which made the CGT worse by saying that the leadership "was not able to solve the problem while the passengers and SNCF were able to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions of occupation are being reviewed closer", the RATP transport companies said.
Which was why the union thinks the company "makes the weekend travellers fun".
In the morning, about 150 drivers took over the business committee in its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calmation".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread on the RER B line on Tuesday after Unsa and Independents announce strike alerts.
The boards request a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independants (Independent)) and are struggling with the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
Drivers of RER suburban trains earn between 2,200 and 2,700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros in irregular working hours and on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved the Kurdish side, and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked a protest and demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can considerably complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when it took most-seven votes to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and Aysela Tuglukova, were prohibited from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity that Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk used and the confiscation of property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 chairs (from 500) in Parliament.
The party's leadership had already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obeying the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political vitrence of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" with the PKK, but refuses to refer to it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government is giving the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offering a number of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to limit Kurdish support to the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a renewed tension in the southeast of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has been detained in clashes with the police have been rejected.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mostly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protestors hurled Molotov's cocktails again or fired stone from the springs.
In Istanbul, too, about a hundred people have been shown.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice only "increases despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdů, note. red.) by ban, said in print.
The Government, created by the party from the Islamic movement, has also condemned this decision.
We're on the anti-invasion principle.
It doesn't solve anything, said Minister of Energy Tanner Yildiz.
This decision is the total rejection of the democratic proposals launched by the government by political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK applied for one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services FES.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first weekend according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
FES is proceeding according to the precise plan.
As soon as they snow in Frankfurt completely and the temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called sections and a cymbal, Brauburger explains.
Among these sections are main and passing strokes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, lines of suburban public transport, pedestrian zones and sections with descending like Atzelbergstraße.
FES starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle the wet salt that is better held within a maximum of three hours, something about 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so the roads are free until the right to work starts."
It's hard when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make room for the spillers."
Only when they do not so much snow are incoming and connecting communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES walkers will be on their way, and dangerous places and crossings will be cleaned preferably.
FES usually can't take care of all cyclists.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows the bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the glacier forms quickly on them, the spills come out immediately as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will call them if necessary.
Dinosaur cradle
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: An animal two metres long and a half foot [150 m] high ran on two strong hind limbs, had a long skull with sharp, twisted teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the flat dry region of the supercontinent of the Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about related relationships, expansion and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging up in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, it's unprecedented for Triassic plantation, informing team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual find: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the Triassus are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational is this finding, but it confirms some theories about early dinosaur history, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the allocation of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards have divided themselves into three most important developmental lines: carnivorous terropods, which later belonged to the Tyranzaurus rex, Velocyraptor, as well as birds, the "long-sauropods" and their relatives, and the ex-eaters of Ornithischia (the catapne), which included, for example, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
Tawa Hallae is after analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, researchers found evidence of air bags on Tawa Hallae’s skull, which also include the offspring of the bird’s terropods.
Thanks to air bags, breathing birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the spine’s bones were obviously filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since related lines of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, it has probably created this useful innovation already common for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because so far known dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists have exported that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, three developmental lines were split up early and spread from South America to all continents that, as the supercontinent of the Pangea, formed a single earth mass.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found two others with Tawa Hallae, not particularly close to related terrorists.
Those three can't come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also discords.
One older species, Silesaurus, who is one of the most difficult dinosaurs to live in today’s Poland, says paleontologist Martin Sander.
Its assumption could bring together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils were preserved, with other continents rarely ever found.
As dinosaurs have proven, from a relatively rare line of reptiles, they have evolved to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Middle Ages, and remain a puzzle.
During the Trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
By the end of the Trias, dinosaurs had spread throughout the world, and many new species had developed, while relatives had died and the interface of the Trias and the Jury.
Success history did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sanders.
There could have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but they didn't.
Or dinosaurs adapted better, so they could squeeze out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorite struck another group of animals, which also developed in the triassic and lived in the shade of mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signs are international.
The list includes professors at University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
The Associates from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Brem joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University has taken care of global unrest.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with protestors at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, "disgrace" the precedent of a stimulated police intervention.
Because the walls and the works of art were gutted, the university President Werner Müller-Estler cleared the building that was occupied last week by the staging students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the matter, the Signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organised teaching of students and teaching police command".
Clearance is an "unacceptable intervention" in freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves as "an illegality and criminalisation of the protest" and draws attention from the contents.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers shall call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
Also, the youth union Verdi and the German trade union are solidarityd with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the procedure of the Universal President and Police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbadenland.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said a member of the Earth's film for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalise a protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there has been a clearance.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the interior minister to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it has paid for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow’s capital, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded site where secret military research was carried out.
Today, the area is considered to be with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
As of September 2008, Green Town representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
Russian delegation was led by the Moscow M.E. Jurij Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoli Smirnov, who signed Edwin Schwarz's planning referee for Frankfurt.
In 2010 FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises will go to Zelenograd for scientific research.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to capture themselves in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Citronics and Rossiskaya Electronics.
The period was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") obtained its name according to the forested hilly landscapes in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared at all.
It is simply a "new heart of Europe" for project supporters.
S21 is more than starting a train station, more than a monster building that will turn the capital of Badenska-Württemberska into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 80 ’ s.
The main stations with railways that ended in the city centre were then considered to be 19th century transport-technical fossils, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormous time to prevent locomotives from behind.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. That's how this works.
That's why the head station is disappearing: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the crossing station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of the Trans-European Railway Motorway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have learned that in the Hesen and Bavarian capital, the beginning of the construction is almost untrustworthy.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor vehicles and control vehicles at both ends, the main station has no problems with driving and leaving.
However: Stuttgart 21 begins, including a new ICE line to Ulm.
Land and municipal politicians put it through.
The routes cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state company.
Urbanistically, the project can be excused in some way.
A new urban space will emerge, which, if we trust computer images of designers, will contain many green spaces.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The crossing stations and the construction of the track are designed for personal transport, which – typically in the 1980s – attributed a tremendous increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
Modern transport policy must go on but first of all to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to the steep rise.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly touches a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be collected in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for further hubs and tight spots in the network.
Sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers of long routes through the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, this route has been slowing down.
There'd have to be a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The track at the bottom of the Rhine becomes the head of the international freight bottle: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left open in Wiesbaden's Landing if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) concerning the ban on night flights and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally review more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today, in writing, argued that the state would have to re-edit the night ban on flights in case of construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, according to the Land Government, does not comply with the law governing the protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January if it will require the revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and came to the Government's representative in order to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to promises regarding the ban on night flights which it had given before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate this as "the violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the hint of the FDP election slogan "We hold the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's statement, the government of the country is trying to get to its night flights by "turning the law and trick".
Strict legal control needs its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression."
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction to ban night flights were never the same as that of the opposition.
US Banks Pays Aid
American, the crisis of the shaken large banks are being decommissioned of state ties.
On Wednesday, Bank of America paid a total of €45 billion (about €30 billion) from the Tarp Bank Savings Fund.
According to the CNBC, Citigroup plans to pay off state aid.
The Constitutions thus want to remove the restrictions on the adoption of money - the limitation of fees to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has secured a good $19 billion net worth of money from investors.
The rest of the amount was taken from her treasury, which was filled, among other things, thanks to professional sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday night specifically: Money injection helped us to overcome difficult times.
The monetary institution damaged itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
The Citigroup also wants to free itself from its commitments to the state by providing money in the capital market.
CNBC reported that the US bank could have announced an increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup's speaker didn't want to comment on that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley paid off.
Quick option
It was only going faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors expelled Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night was about to make a deal on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital city of Berlin, was the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so that the process didn't go ahead.
However, the role could also play that they did not want to harm the authorising officer of the ZDF, Markus Schächter, if this proposal did not go through with the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the game.
The result of the vote was not known before the closure of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he lost the Schächter Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
For Brender only seven votes, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though expected.
The EU's majority in the board of directors has signalled several weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized a resistance to the editor.
He rejected another stay in the Office of the Highly Respected Editor by arguing that for Brender, the monitoring quotas for the ZDF's reporting were reduced.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, protests were strongly criticised by the political influence on the ZDF.
Last but not least, there were 35 state-law lawyers who regard Koch’s procedure as unconstitutional.
It wasn't worth it.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Binggen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 went from Frey to ZDF, first to Heute-journal.
Other stations: 1988-1990 personal referee of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the professional periodical Media Magazine journalist of the year, was sat down, Zelena was notified that they were filing a constitutional complaint.
Koch's counter-candidate on the Board of Directors, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal countries should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the personal proposals of the authorising officer could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF.
Brender's alleged successor, Peter Frey, instructed the board with a smart chess move - immediately after taking Brender down, he criticized the big game for it.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him as chief editor without losing face to Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that a party would be pushed into the office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already classified as left-wing liberals.
Study Gets rid of the harpsichord
Partly Success for Students: After the year of strike, ministers of culture finally entered the municipal countries on Thursday: At a conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that the will is to improve the study conditions for baccalaurers and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: In principle, each study module should be terminated by one single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be reviewed and a "real and defensive peace" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The common countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for bachelor and master's study courses.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have spoken of a better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board has agreed that the number of tests will, in part, drastically decrease: "Every module will normally be completed only by one test", says the 30-page report, which is intended to regulate, in part, the approval of the study departments.
"Extremely lower test load," said the chairman of the Accreditation Board of Reinhold Grimm, "should be stopped by a flawed development that has significantly reduced the difficulty of the study."
To this end, the "study challenge" in the future is the "decision criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be checked hard" to "no longer limit students in the selection process
Seminars."
Students should be entitled to a space that allows and supports their own initiative.
The rules are to be applied when approving new study courses, after examination, but also for existing study courses.
You need to "recredit" every five years – but this means that it will last until 2015 before all study stages are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation boards set up by the federal countries.
In October, the ministers of culture called on the federal countries to act on the agencies to ensure that the full training was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual countries, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures with the Polish ministries.
As the only country to date has promised Porin-Falcko additional means for further development of the Bologna Process.
With money, universities should, in particular, build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen the testing and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a new university law to parliament.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
Forming a study should be even more flexible, ensuring recognition of tests from other universities and making it easier for a master to access.
By the end of next year, the difficulty of all study areas in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition renegotiated on the country's study conditions.
The criticism of the resolution also fell along with praise.
The Juso Group's joint board called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future by "closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should be spoken to as well by students as the person concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelová: "We need students' experience", she said on Thursday at a meeting with Culture Ministers, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Boards of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution went far enough: They require a legal right that would allow each graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a construction master's degree.
Secondly, the federal countries must ensure that for today's generation of students, there are enough places available tomorrow in master's study fields with the best study conditions, said GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
Community countries must employ far more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express their free access to master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of one poet, Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out language piece discusses the experience of traveling one dissident, who has gained freedom, but also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, he first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a children's book publishing company, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A significant extra-literary riot took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently, the disturbed and infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer were admitted to cooperation as a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
It is said that attempts to recruit began inadvertently, first in 1971.
I'm, continued with Sollner, "then someone who didn't defend himself enough against attempts to intimidate by Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is Secret Agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary settlement with the dictatorial government mechanisms is a literary scene, especially the community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that denotes the depth and disgrace of the political system, which is based on scrutiny and speculation.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if you can say it according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
In the acts of Securitate, Secret Agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter.
"He cut me off" at all the important points for him, Markel says.
He has a moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was in this form, and it was unexpected to this audience, but it is not a completely surprising confession by the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the security peaks.
The subsidy, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases probably know which name is hidden behind the cover of Sorin, Voic and exactly Walter.
Unlike in the local, while very certain examination of the components of the Staze, manipulation of the remaining control of the Securitate is still highly diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been dreamt and limited.
One of Birthler's authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act took place more recently since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the components.
That former members of the Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, he presented one interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temeswar expressed his rejection of the award bearer.
She says she's psychotic, she's been interrogated only once after all.
The corruption of power has been expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as in the case of silenced guilt, raises inevitable questions.
Why until now? Whom has been injured? The special reaction of listeners to Söllner’s confession makes him expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine a desire for knowledge rather than a desire for guilt and study.
The genetics of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Satisfied Deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party, at which he distributed sports candy products to the new coach VfBr Christian Gross, who was accompanied by an orange-coloured sugar bag.
A man with a brand-new dance was allowed to drive around a foreign town because of him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck was the 55-year-old man also few.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he'll continue to work.
Or it'll just start.
The words of only three days of engagement of Switzerland: "We have all reached the eight-finals", because in Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be able to see success: It will be a brutally hard fight against accession."
"A far more important task" stands ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in the Moguča performance from the royal class and on the ordinary league day.
And prevent re-evident weaknesses after three quick goals of Marica (5), Träsche (8) and Funerals (11).
Breakdown
The Osmifinál Champions League (game 16/17. + 23/24 February/ match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of Babbel’s successor’s shivering appearance will be preserved.
Not only with a supposed healer who has added confidence, willingness to sit, and joy from the game to uncertain Stuttgart professionals during a short period of confidence.
I went to the players and I told them to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be braver, explained the soul healer Gross so easily sounding a successful recipe, which but for the actions of the therapist Babbel did not show any effectiveness.
He was breathing certain magic, admitting to Babbel's admirer Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after many weeks of interruption caused by injury, became thanks to his dynamics immediately the best player on the field, tried to describe the found "phenomen" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the work procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Apparently, Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports President Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened alternate and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won even Glasgow before an ugly awakening came after defeat 0:4 in Leverkusen, Kheder thought.
And sports President Horst Heldt recalled that one goal had reached in the season, but the other is still a long way off.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a television conversation with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that act other than Jens, which Heldt has taken to the hard Lehmann criticism.
He'd run a soft lead for the board and decided to change the coach after the pressure of the teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was canceled his day off after the games marked Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's sayings "form pure egoism", he defied Heldt and announced the sequences for goalkeepers.
The two 40s will probably have no more joy in life.
However, they are one with others, that without the work of a team of coaches, it would not be possible to play such a playerly strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the needle's bag agrees.
A Battle of the World Championship in a Heavy Vase
A critical duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's champion Vitali Klick.
However, after 12 hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavy weight of the boxing organization WBC.
The verdict of the referees was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Klíčko remains the world's champion in a heavyweight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klick, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't come up to everyone's expectations.
The key improved its balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional battles, he was beaten twice for injury.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in a 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena drove a 2,02m high Klitzko duel mainly by his left hand.
A quarter of an inch [11 cm] smaller Johnson, who announced before the duel the end of the Klèčko era, but withdrew before the blows of the world's master, so Klíčko could not plant a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In all, he did a passive Johnson on the challenger pretty little, and he was just trying to get into the other circles.
Although the key provoked words and gestures, his blows but the master of the world only hit a few times.
But still, it was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, who fought Klitczyk full twelve laps.
The challenger took care of the riot in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klick like a "disgusting zombie" who can't do anything right.
During Friday's weighing, the champion was allowed to provoke, pulled Johnson out of the nose of sunglasses, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory After the Return Click
The key remained undefeated after the fourth fight on 11 October 2008.
After nearly a four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to hand over without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically I was in good shape, justified Click quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is worn by Britt David Haye after settling down from the throne of 2,13 metres high Nikolai Vulaeva in November.
Haye refused to fight Klitczyk in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning his promoter company to fight Klitczyk in London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
The main attack from the opposition: The head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction has called it a lie because of the misinformation about the Kunduz affair of the Secretary of Defense of Guttenberg.
SPD and Linke (Left) invite the chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of an attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a conscious deception.
The minister to the deadly bombing of two tankers in September said "knowingly false", said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's ARD "Tagesschau" news show.
Let's call it the usual expression:
The killing order was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO, read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it appeared that the attack was not only about the destruction of hijacked trucks but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US raid requested by German commander Kunduzu Colonel Klein, NATO's investigation of killing or wounding up to 142 people occurred.
Greens, SPDs and Linke called on Saturday for Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately in front of the House and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether the strategy for targeted killing part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Snow - and whether the Office of Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has definitely rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's Office has no influence on the specific deployment of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also some doubts about the Ministry's mistrial on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were correctly informed of the background of the attack on tankers.
Officially, they had to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the Minister with sensitive details.
However, from the vicinity of the two top officials, it was noted that the Ministry of Defence had even pointed out several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert was to ask in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response so far.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the issues and pointed out that this would be dealt with by the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Court, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a vigilant state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not only are the mentally ill or drug-related borders between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience sleeplessness see and hear things that others do not see and hear, usually in today’s Western world, they pay for being a fool or a drug addict or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only for the mentally ill or drug-related.
Vinu has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, will here and there make sure that the boundaries between dreams, imagination and reality merge.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experience of the New-Age Carlos Castaneda prophet, the shamanic states of blasphemy, psychosis and hallucinations can be diverted from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions will arise if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – occurs, and interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between fornication and sleep has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity to delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud was even a dream of "psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusion, deception of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it's hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He can feel the kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red faces, appreciative teeth.
They chase him, they kick him in with heavy, fire boots, they throw him against the wall, they feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices he is given and insulted.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, traps them in a loop and hooks it to the ceiling.
He goes up on one speaker and he puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, the choir's voices are breaking his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he suffered six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSDs were launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides being manic-depressive, taking anti-depressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are terrible facts.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most people are unable to distinguish between the inner and the outside world, reaching into an awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, large-scale, relative illusions or persecution illusions.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of votes - votes that order, comment or conduct dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are uncommon.
The disabled is unable to distinguish the important from the irrelevant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis builds flood thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the top doctor of the Clinics of General Psychiatry of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenia, therefore, often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible in them, ghosts are terrible facts, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime, experience hallucination
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "but the meaningful and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
Deceptive thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to alienate experience occurs within a real framework.
A scientist is still in the face of a puzzle as to why our brains are making such a mess.
Special states can lead everyone to lose their relationship to reality in the short term, Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists estimate that the affected have minimal brain damage.
In the early stages of development, we believe that brain neuronal development, such as the mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, will be damaged, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle as to how the neural system will be broken, which has not appeared in any way for many years.
Roles also play the influences of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if it is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a matter of attitude.
Casten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, interpreting its results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations include typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions the very brain of a healthy person.
Hallucinations, according to Casten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are too active or slightly suppressed; if our brain is welded, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, concern with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, she reported up to a third of those who were asked that they had been hallucinated for at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Early Pomorjansk and goes to a higher school there.
She's a normal girl, actually.
If only there weren't the patterns and the voices.
Breaks can be called long, dark hair.
When he answers, the students look at her with surprise - no one sees her and hears this boy.
This impertinent girl thinks she's a drunk dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are more puzzling.
Often delusions are burdensome.
When she sits in class, she can't follow the teaching many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else in a hearing and visible way on the mathematical equation board.
At night, the phenomena are more exclamational.
When waiting in his dark room for sleep, which comes few times and too late, he often cannot tell if he is awake or if he is asleep, if the images he sees, the grimas, or the girl with bleeding cut wounds on her hands and feet are created before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, they're screaming at the characters.
Parents and friends don't say anything about it, they'd think she'd gone crazy.
In autumn 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she graduated and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted a psychologist named Casten on the Internet, she knows she hasn't gone crazy.
Preludes are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is disincentived, they will likely have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to take care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad has not been her own father since she thought.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "it takes place in the brain, also reality appears there.
Hallucinations are also images that will make the brain come into existence, so they act so realistically."
The nighttime dreams are also assessed by Casten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ significantly from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Limit state between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world focused too much on consciousness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and Head of Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams which the concerned considers to be real and cannot even be reversed from the wake condition.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full consciousness of motorized disease.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example, by a lasting, complete inability to move, replaces life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
Type of borderline state between sleep and hallucination.
Because there is no way to deal with a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will come to light.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses into some unbearable situation that enables us to form our own ability to pass during the moment into loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after surgery, a heart valve with subsequent heart transplantation gave him consciousness on a several - day journey, while his body lay immobile on an intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into a world that he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man chained to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce stunning blood substances.
On a motorcycle, the Greek will take him to his country, surf the hospital bed in the Alps and meet the Korean mobster.
It's sinking completely into an imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of those mental pathways are clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug connections, how fragile our internal images are and how vigilant our internal images are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Casten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At 27 they have to take over publishing children
Kallen's new directorate is a transitional solution: Longevity wants Hubert Burda to hand over his business to his two children, SPIEGEL said.
The holding is to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business long in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the business, says 69 - year - old SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question, if they are also active in the company, is then asked.
And the question of whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put up with 7,500 employees of your children unless they are sufficiently capable.
It would kill kids and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he has withdrawn from the Presidency of the Board since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burdy since 1999.
He was in charge of technology first.
Later, with the section Pošlovna added responsibility for the assets of the company and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct marketing, Zizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are in charge of publishing.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who today would be 42, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "lock up 10, 15 years", Burd said.
Holding should belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda says.
In view of Schickenanz and Schaeffler's cases, Burda said that even family businesses do not have the certainty of extinction: "It has always happened to companies that have been infected with the desire for capital that speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burd says.
I don't behave as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time," these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and this is a time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrities wear, and to adapt to this also to their festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlighting the figure, which is necessary to bear in mind.
Here are a few suggestions.
Fergie's singer has chosen an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend it.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
Endesa’s energy company and the Barcelona City Council founded the “LIVE Office”.
This is a project for the development and enforcement of electric cars in the capital city of Catalanska.
LIVE's Office (Mobile Logistic) will establish and manage a travel plan for the deployment of electric cars in the city and secure mobility agreements, will handle, coordinate and submit contributions etc.
It will also develop theMOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect views and results of activities in the related sectors.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
This is the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVEL Plan to support the deployment of electric cars.
Endes’ energy company has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented on European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the 'cleaning period' of the automotive industry.
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Prime Minister, predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is awaiting a "calm period".
In the 2009 economic report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the Car Sector, we would be awaiting a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main production companies," the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace for this industry is anticipated in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competition plan, which forms part of the Integrated Road Sector Plan (PIA), identified 800 million for 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments exceeding EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is designed to develop new models, to modernise production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed a 6% reduction in the average level of emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" of entries, namely in November by "40%".
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid the first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is the space for professional and amateur encounters from the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid Casa de Campo.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will also be products of all kinds related to the world of motors.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical engines, real bottles for collectors and visitors.
Among the participating companies are the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and repair of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, specialised company Mercedes Benz.
Test of competence in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Quality tests will also be carried out for classical cars and motorcycles in an adapted area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sports style
Mazda intends to show that greed towards the surrounding environment has no negative influence on sports style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - baptized also as-stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a gasoline engine of 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics which it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle implementation, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver’s seat are excellent ergonomic and are excellently fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
With the tool kits and consoles we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese tendency to develop futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a strong red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, in particular, even more with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large luggage space and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is available only with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-stage hand transmission.
This engine is a real lakota. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most desired Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, because it is characterized by greater comfort in driving and reduced consumption.
As for equipment, the version selected for testing is Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is important to mention in particular the system of track monitoring (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of motion and stability, control of speed, internal mirror sensitive to light, onboard computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels of 17 inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, with an extra fee of 1,500 euros: an adaptable light of two-xenon and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not find more kilometers per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR21.770 for the implementation of the Luxury and EUR 23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.

Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without being able to view a particular type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine recognized him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is marked with very low prices and monthly payments, less than half the amount to be paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but it is necessary to pay six times for Peek.
FonPeek, who was presented at Le Web yesterday, is a European version of invention and its third change.
It is limited as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People with smartphones already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the borders or to look impatiently for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) to see the mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a doctorate in physics would need to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they can be accessible to Europe as a whole, which still does not have a skinned effect.
There is cause for concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) means that operators are starting to think differently and considering different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offering book download and other Internet search.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable on purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the FonPeek case, it's the possibility of buying a permanent approach like that Peek is already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it's the best type from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the popular color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to become president of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: passing Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: apart from the fact that it is a similar color - yellowish green with flickering effects- in both cases it was a class set - a dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The substance from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of her arrival, Michelle used a large leg, in Oslo with a press release.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium heels, now similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears different hairstyles: this one, this one, pre-dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger years who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'fertility and working career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to maternity.
The study emphasises that at the beginning of partnering, there are many differences in views on whether or not they work or work, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part - time or have no stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child before giving birth, and have a total of more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and motherhood, are delaying and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the start of co-existence with the partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have spent most of their lives reaching their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone the partnership and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong impact on motherhood, even though it has a minor impact on starting a relationship with her partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is involved in research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
Differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 or 32.1 years of age.
"There is still another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education are getting married and giving birth to the first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education are moving in reverse prefer to obtain a stable job, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since next year, a German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I am behind it'.
Presenter 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international actors, is thus added to another famous L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
Even before it entered this selected band of actress Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chatter').
The male part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by important personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evantela's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say about fashion issues.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, formerly and most recently - met at the annual transfer of prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing a meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his normal life).
They do not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarities, life and work), but they seek something similar to the core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent does not save the pains or the inspiration.
This book is an excellent readership, even at repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, is the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, no sense as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to achieve heaven by means of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odysseus published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-thousand peaks in the universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers will often fall."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
In his own way, he said he was the heir to a county shipman, and another time he was the son of a black girl with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the confused scream of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing to himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt and prayed: 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman."
Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were carved the verses of Spencer: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after the storm a peaceful port,/after the war rest,/after a full life's death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage, he also carried his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was following her among the azalaks or that the birds were singing Greeks.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos mean than targeting Joyce in Baroja?
What else was it about Bennet before he let Barois execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else was the matter with Cele than to make himself famous for the glory of that man?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week my 70-year-old mother passed our quarter in Fuenlabrad district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by the neighborhood and our dog, a cross between a shelter of at least six kilograms, kicked her twice, and hurt her badly.
Our anger is greater than that we see nothing amusing about such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the horizon.
And to that the old lady's shock after this incident, when she was walking with these individuals, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil possessed by an animal invader is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock this afternoon, Tuesday, in usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest commissionership, but we doubt that it was for something and that we should not raise delicate questions, we find that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Indignation has caused us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when they are engaged in the suffering of a defenseless animal that gives us love, company, and friendship.
We don't understand where right manners have gone, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transportation Safety Foundation (Fesvioal), has launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, mainly for younger motorists, as both operators have today informed.
The purpose of this initiative is to stress the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their obligations relating to transport safety, which "means more than to design and produce even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose and otherwise by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the heading 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 repairs to motorcycles will be placed to get the awareness of the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is "a constant problem" for this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12,6 % compared to 2008 and more, the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures by the patron organization of Anfac and the vendors of Ganvem.
However, it is better to quarantine the positive data, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger cars derivatives, pick ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And even the clouds that are the most damaging to demand have not disappeared, although they have been purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases are carried out by small and medium-sized companies and in 100% of the cases are financing through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation should be added to the limitations resulting from the closure of the bank credit source.
In a given situation, unlike passenger cars, the promotion of purchase 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, mention should be made of individuals engaged in a retail list of small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam, they reiterated the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (stones and buses).
The Sales Association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and calculated sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system at the hand brake is already mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the stability control of the ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of this will become compulsory equipment of European vehicles.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for removing the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, so that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver fails.
But he can't always keep this pressure up to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car parts manufacturer, a third of drivers in an accident did not hit the brake before the crash and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance shall require the maximum of the braking system and shall reduce the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more marked by calculations, one of the four accidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case the vehicles will be equipped with a system which (with the assistance of a radar or a camera) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pedal pressure if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device shall act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January.
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, the employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), said that the production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer points out that it will take more time to meet the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan agree first with the party involved.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the staff and then to the governments of the individual countries where the production plants are located, may be issued at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that Saab’s sales decision should be taken these days.
No wonder the Swedish government increased pressure on the American producer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to obtain Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer, Skype, who works under the auspices of the Russian Converg Group.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with either of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The Saab shall continue to be decided at the end of the year to close unless its sale succeeds.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
During the development of this excellent model, the Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of this, first of all, the automatic download roof is in paid hand-operated execution, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; further used aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air-conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres has also contributed to a reduction of another 7 kg; after installation of the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightened 19-inch wheeled five kilos.
Finally, removing CDR-30 means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handle with textile grips means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a double-joint PDK transmission, one vehicle with hand-ordered six-stage gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many tight turns.
His behaviour can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight loss does not mean that the vehicle does not press for asphalt.
Rather just the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time would convey such security when moving in the turn, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of heating up the muscles during a short drive for the right time until we get him to sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, because of the control that's so communicative as accurate, whatever we put our hands on the wheel, it's what the car will do.
And do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is a very gift and it is possible to strengthen it with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine sound that has already been used in Panamara.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether during suction or repurchase.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt road that we're driving with Boxster Spyder was pretty messed up, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride, and in some corners we found a flash of frost and gravel even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, since it is more than just a modification of Boxster S.
The car will be placed for sale in February 2010 at €70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Friend of Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Cocoon's icon and occasional 'starlette' at the 'company' show, the singer shows her face to an evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel purse.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's Bag Girl.
The Basconia Condemned Victory in Israel
She obtained a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her stay on the complicated Maccabi Electro field, despite numerous abstentions in Duska Ivanovice, and thus got to the head of her group after a major performance by Miri Teletovice, who with eight trinitarian points was declared the best in the team (29 reviews).
Vitoria has been able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Olesona, Huertase or Mic's large dose of deployment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of a circle with 16 triplicate points was very much involved in the final triumph.
The match began with a forehead for the blue men who stood up for the brand from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from afar, already suggesting that they had attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the alabaster cooperative decided for the internal game Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was accepted by sanding and applause upon returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show up as the best in his team with 13 points, although no six at Splitter's evaluation indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazilians.
But although the game was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the smallest and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone on their field was winning, and 'arm Elias' was able to win.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to the return of yellow to exile (50-49).
More Inconvenient
The members of Ivanovic, the injuries, but not the dead at all, needed a few exact games to take a breath, and then a machine gun of Mirza Teletovic appeared, which three trinitaries almost by itself, with the help of English and Ribase, returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaws have skinned themselves in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to lose them for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their men, did not give up and try to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter voted out for foul sevanovic, they did not hold back and defend well, and although the Israelis were approaching the final minute (80-85), the match had already been won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Hurts make it impossible for the United States to fight
Unikaja significantly lost in Greece with the Olympics and left him leading Group B in Eurolize in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unikaj, but mainly an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
Malagia did not complain about Pavilion's environment of peace and friendship or rivals, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defenses and three three points each, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubi, radiated the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Uniica , although the arena of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the USBeverley and Williams battles meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to function and proved its advantage in both zones, where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiméneze were burdened by the Uniania team
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Revenge
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing at 19, proved the advantage and even managed to compensate for the difference between the match in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unikaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who injured himself during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unikaj thanks to leadership and triple points Cook and the benefits of Lewis left a certain hope of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because the Olympics, thanks to their strength and strength in centimeters, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatian beer Nikola Vujcic, able to balancebasket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unikaja hesitated and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much would you like to collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, search engines with the highest number of classified ads in the field of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take? computes user fees based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to insert a profession, years of experience, age and city where the applicant wishes to work.
During the week that application works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to data available to Trovit from his search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
British programmer takes 45.226 euro a year gross and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver is paid 34,247 euros a year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the worst paid work of a waiter with 11,592 euros a year is followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after job on the network in the last three months is the driver, half-term employment and social worker.
Brazil sets the date for Zelay’s departure
The Brazilian government set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to be held at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-designate must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d’Affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy on this date, where he has been hiding since 21 September.
"He is aware that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya phoned.
Following the November 29th elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which was sought by the government 'de facto', which is chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when the inflation of assets represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has again appeared on the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where policymakers make decisions about the future, which is uncertain about themselves.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise the market was to recover the debt directly by purchasing assets and to release liquidity indirectly in the near zero rate so that the financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended without questioning their unnatural liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into the environment, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterotoxic measures, and we are taking part in the return of a reduction in risk returns.
The volatility of the stock exchange and the differences in the bonds society have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialise the private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the US, Japan and Germany became a haven for the selected investors, expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the decline in the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless to silence advocates of moral risk, who again tried to burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy because of the curbing of the destructive consequences of limiting the credit to employment, when in fact a new day of thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and a new government is coming.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from default at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries not to fulfil their commitments.
But what is logical is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to make its own citizens more transparent and commit to a shared responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as expected, we are ahead of the transition risk premium normalisation period, some of the gains in supported positions would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as European company bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences fall and our differences expand further, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the services of studies to overlook their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 climb scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope of living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "carefully, my driver's friend".

President Iberdola Ignacio Sánchez Galán intervened first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House of Representatives, where the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed these days in the next two decades.
Following his intervention following the presentation of President Gus Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made several comments on the proposal submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000m euros by 2020 and another 60,000m from that date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrol is indeed of the opinion that over the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
The issue has changed since 2020 and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is a need for a new 18,000 MW, but with other "supportive energy".
Galán, who believes, the proposal for a sustainable economy law, which the government has just approved, corresponds to the line that the company has requested, did not want to release mercury as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "exact" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
However, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport ground services, Swiss Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of preferential partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday for the creation of an intelligent infrastructure innovation centre
The Association expects investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and water industry.
The building in question is estimated at 1,700 million dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its opponents are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A 5km long tunnel in the eastern coast of Brisbane, Australia, has become the closest option for Action to settle in this country as a construction and concessional highway undertaking.
The City Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the English Initial) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May and the projected investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final stage of the competition three companies with a significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transparency leads Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Gella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second is based in Italy is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
In front of the Acciona group, Northern Direct is in the game with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last company that went through the network has the name LBRJV and the Australian capital Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the major civil construction company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big construction and privatisation, but it brings with it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than mediating the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector in addition to the Asian reference.
ACS gained market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton’s quoted company.
Millions of assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for a given sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria runs a group of enterprises that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground road to the tolling road, the promoter of which is the Office of Infrastructures of Brisbane, with the name Northern Link (north link), is to connect the western highway from Toowong with the county route in Kelvin Grove (see map) for a length of 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the biggest event to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans the assignment for the summer 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is to be planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this order to Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief a significant profit, since yesterday it announced a government contract estimated at 154 million.
Share ACS shall operate through its Leighton local branch office infrastructure of the national network of a wide band with a cable made of optical fibre.
This situation will allow fast internet access to 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the King George Tower on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction was just about to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, particularly in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpina branch, obtained an allocation of EUR 64.5 million of the tunnel with a length of 2.1 kilometres for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company received a contract a few days after working to expand the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, for 130 million.
In this way, the Alps strengthens their experience in building tunnels.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe.
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Sra for the last two years. Rushmore, with approximately EUR 3 million per year, informed the railway company.
The contract includes an extension of 12 months each year. Scra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition written by Renfe, of which four have entered the finals, among them TBWA, which was responsible for the creation of advertising in the last three years.
Rushmore will be taking care of campaign design and production.
fine of 63 million for France Télécom for discontinuing competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on LFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the country's Caribbean areas.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers at the edge of regulation.
This penalty has been imposed by the former French monopoly and still the state company has purchased more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for placing obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority believes France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and has thus been recidivised.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries like Spain.
The Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barçe from the beginning 476.4 million
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the point that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The Charter is run by Manchester United.
The Charter is run by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided 5,362,5 million euros between 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) which participated since the 1992/1993 tournament took place, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one with AC Milan, who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan contemporary champion and last winner of the disappearing Cup of Europe in 1992 is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two cooperatives, which also charged the most money to participate in the past Lize masters.
And yet she lost both of them to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third country that has won the most money through Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seemingly paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, the authority chaired by Michel Platini is planning to make $1.090 million for Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA devotes 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million for their presence only, with the exception of another 550,000 euros for each match they attend.
There is also a prize for the win (800,000 euros) and for the draw (400,000 for each team). Osmifinalists get three million each; eight quarterfinalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion makes $9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club earns at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group published the details of the offer to buy shares with which it wants to obtain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public tender for the acquisition of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which she would pay in ten years and for which he would pay interest for this deferment 1% per year.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading at EUR 1.85; so Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of the Sos.
The tender shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Yerez Group shall provide a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce is changing the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and to compensate for the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jorda was announced as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision constitutes the first woman to occupy a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, since the company is still plunged into a legal battle for the alleged movement of more than 230 million from Sos by the Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will discover new movements of funds in the coming months cannot be deleted.
Regarding the Salazar loan, former members of the Board of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Uniica representatives) spoke at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were going.
CNMV allows the exclusion option Paternina, which participated in Inversor Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion of Inversora Mer against Federic Paterninov on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorised the operation, since it understood that its conditions were in accordance with the applicable standards and considered it "sufficient" content explaining the brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at obtaining the 550.008 Federica Paterniny shares at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142.786 shares admitted to trading on exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been derailed, which would not be transferred in any way until the tender specified that the price had been fixed by the Federation Patternina in accordance with the provisions in force.
New instruments for car rating
These days, storms and accidents don't just earn car service.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are dragged to a service where the expert must estimate damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be long and hard work.
Calculation of manual repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labour may take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance shall provide them with the information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatax, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the reviews are done with its products.
Other companies that compete in the fields of sector appreciation and information are GtMotmotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velazquez, business director of Audatax, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing continues to increase, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hot job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and its price determined.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "discharge" the individual parts of the tourist cars.
With regard to a model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the miniature car, it may take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis, for example.
In terms of traffic park in circulation, 99% are exceeded.
For the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national residence is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are over a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working together with three computer screens.
Audatax invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are entered and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this enormous stream of information enables undertakings to use and provide different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but according to each country, there are also tools for the management of spare parts or for the calculation of the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatax doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
With regard to products offered by Audatax, it is easy to obtain support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard insurance award solution designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, the time for repairs estimated by the manufacturer or by the varnishes shall also be included.
This tool shall be valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that carries out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatax.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came from the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows the vehicles to be excluded with the overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of the brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and the solution of the damage, accidents or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia appreciation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 it charged 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalising the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audatex was created in Germany in 1966 and was established in 1979 in Spain.
According to company sources, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, including 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoice of the Soler Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera's group stood on the $1,000 million stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after a insurance event.
The operation assumed a subscription of €59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year by 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This evaluation and purchase and sale service is awarded exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rentals, services, spare parts sales and professional sellers who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and on the Spanish market, about 100 new ads are added every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose vehicle number has been discarded cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be permitted to operate, even though they have been excluded, after prior control.
The four-step service budget
With Auda-Taller, Audatax guarantees that the user will only receive the budget in four steps: vehicle identification, replacement search, budgeting and budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the belief of professionals of a higher age who are more or less resilient in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
A computer with Internet connection is needed naturally for use.
After identification of the model to be fixed using the chassis number, a real graphic representation of the model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the labor force, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for appreciation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented to service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At the present time, Audatex is working to make this picture three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows for example to select a door and turn it around to show the inside.
