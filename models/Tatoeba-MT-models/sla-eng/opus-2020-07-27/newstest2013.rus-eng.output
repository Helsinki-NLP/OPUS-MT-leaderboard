Republican strategy against the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy of combating falsifications in elections.
At the Brennan Centre, however, the last myth is that cases of falsification in the United States elections are rarer than deaths of lightning strikes.
In addition, there were only 300 cases of elective falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredited the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have adopted laws since 2009 that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon was re-emerged after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, in just one year, 180 draft laws were adopted restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the electorate to present a photo identification and proof of the existence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the declaration and withdraw the right to vote from the citizens who have jurisdiction.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state had obliged voters to submit identification cards with photographs.
Indiana became the first state to make such a request.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities had made an effort to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated draft legislation that obliges voters to produce photographic identifications in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have identity cards with photographs issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens aged 65 or over, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo identification.
But that's not all.
Students who are considered to vote as democratic candidates are not permitted in several states to use a photo identification card issued by their educational institution.
The same states, however, allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state had required proof of the existence of American nationality for voting.
For the first time, such a request was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of members of Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republic legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
That restriction did not go without effect.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republic legislators adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the voting period.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted earlier were African-Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was true of Latin American citizens.
They represented only 11 per cent of the voters, representing 24 per cent of the citizens who had voted before.
Unlike whites, which formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of the voters had voted before.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were promised by Democrats.
The most controversial laws were suspended in the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring identification with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have entered into force will certainly hamper the exercise of electoral law in the 2012 elections.
Critics of Democrats condemn the bias of laws that have been enacted, with an obvious focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brennan in 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Board in order to win the presidential election.
It is too early to argue that these legislative changes at the electoral system will have a significant impact on the 2012 presidential election results.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredited the system of American democracy.
The screening of the cancer of the prominent iron: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces false results, false, and sometimes false positive results, which result in useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergo dissertation, have even more to be suspected of.
Is it a test or not?
We asked the opinion of the two experts.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, and data are difficult to interpret and difficult to come up with any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different level of mortality among patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastases occurring is 30-40 per cent higher than those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend a test starting at 50 years of age, or at 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer has been detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and cumbersome.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer by offering him options without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, but by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more often, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I would recommend that you do the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor in order to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess all the causes of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented if all human beings ate well and moved hard enough.
“If no one else smoked, this figure would increase to at least 50%”, stressed André Bolje, secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous damage to human health.
“Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said Spokesman André Bolje.
It is encouraging that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
Wes
According to the CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and straight intestines, gastrointestinal glands, and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects from cancer the colon”, added the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or salinity may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer”, the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But the results of these studies are not clear right now.
According to SCC, studies of vitamin E produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite result.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also not fully clear.
However, Mr. Boljo stressed that it was important to discuss its concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs Boson, triggered a real seduction, and not without a reason.
This boson is believed to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum imperfect" description of nature and behaviour of matter - but which had not been discovered in the past.
But physicists are still convinced that it is the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson that is predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine it's the Higgs boson, because the odds of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is completely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, even trying too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: Paula's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quant state” is a “state” in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called farms, who wisely obey Paula ' s principle.
On the other hand, there are bosons, an ugly band of anarchists, who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they can safely be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (in fact, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we will not talk about here, and the “force particles” through which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which the Higgs Boson refers in some way.
These bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all exotic beings as one might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of the light", which is the "smoker" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a spring.
This “infringement” is caused by an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of “force conveyors”.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that in order for this boson to occur, another field, the Higgs field, must be broken.
However, the Higgs field of much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to set it on fire, it takes a very high level of energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, such as the one operated at CERNE - the Great Adron Collider, which is a 27km diameter ring! - to achieve such enormous energy.
A similarity with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: paper sheet, for example, will never be kept on its own.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others (such as photon, by the way) do not have it.
So what could "can" all these studies ask Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a difference between the results of the observations and the forecasts of the MV.
In addition, some of them are passionate about finding such a discrepancy, i.e. the slightest discrepancy might open the door to “new physics” and shut some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings without offering any explanation for gravity (y!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (y!).
But so far, they haven't found such differences in CERN.
Consequences
The use of these studies for the everyday life of a mediocre person would be more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it was not available.
See: right at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's laboratories could not even predict what revolution would cause their work.
They anticipated their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, already a late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who himself designed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally viewed as a “laboratory gadget”.
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the study accompanying tools.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although not originally intended, now serves as a “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can happen.
Palliative aid is the best way to die.
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed a delicate end to life.
The debates should soon resume and the bill was being drafted at that time.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Debt tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Hadbua's palliative care facility in Belley, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents people from going to the toilet and even eating themselves.
Sitting at a table where he has an appetizing meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even smiles, talks to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
A man before his usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for the disease.
"In life, we are taught that a man should pee on the stand," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's shelter.
Regressing to a child's condition is unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to accept the decline, he argues.
Because many people who are involved in palliative care believe that important developments occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Projections give them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides assistance called “medical”.
Ms. A., age 89, is most afraid of dying "in consciousness of strangulation."
But the illness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for the last day of her son's visit from Italy.
At Victor Gadbua Home, a team of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
That is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, each 11,700 inhabitants have one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Life here continues under the best possible conditions, explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Be it physical, emotional, or emotional.
To the dying, we agree to give mouthwash from brandy or Pepsi, even if he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son finished that beer in his feet this morning at the deceased's.
“We help loved ones as well as patients, ” says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor Hadboa's shelter doesn't look like the day before.
Next to a 93-year-old who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, laying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a young man 36 years old dies tragically surrounded by parents, a wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five cases have always been in cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel, anxiously.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gadbua are from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The Problem of Access to palliative Care
77 per cent of Canadians are deemed to have no access to palliative care, that is, care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, at the hospital or at the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec ' s health system that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and aids in suicide.
Since October, the manifesto, signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, has been circulating and has shown their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec ' s health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative high-quality care before the transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to help them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients before the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard’s survival hopes were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I had stopped fighting, she said.
And she told me my days were considered!
No All - Powered Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are medical personnel for failing to comply with their request after the team's palliative care has facilitated their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Big Montreal House Society, patients are not susceptible to 8% of the treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient sleeps until the time of his death, either from time to time or on a regular basis.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Pain sufferers always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanasia," which means "I want to be relieved."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund-raising and the Italian mafia day after day tell of what they know about the vast system of building industry, public servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
The industry, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system breaks down after all the funds have been made, that Jacques Ducheno, the deputy and former head of the Montreal Police are joking."
It was because of this scandal in 2011 that resulted in the investigation of official offences related to road contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of the time of the liberals, Jean Shari, was very reluctant to accept.
Ducheno ' s report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the start of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would retain a billion dollars in contracts” if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbond Commission “has already set up two mayors”, he added, hoping that it would be able to “open up schemes behind individual personalities”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
In 2011, the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts, joined the case.
In addition, the officers of the special unit Molot, who had forced Montreal’s “stock cartel” after 2009, to stop overestimating the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been conducted in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markotto, mayor of the small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gilles Wayancourt, recently retired from the mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in the placement of government orders.
In addition, the official indictment was brought to several engineers on the route to Montreal and to construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkouro and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated the real bomb by investigating the “system” of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito paid 3 per cent of the value of the Montreal contracts to a mob broker who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Tramble's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito made money to the right and to the left, and he listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natali Normando.
Sanitation contracts with higher value
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unfailingly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described her in detail to the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction firms, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, which he had increased in value.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they have received a fee of 30-40 per cent through false additions.
Then one mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Riviera de Prai County in the east of the island has been opposed to the sale since 2010 of a 5 million-dollar municipality and reselled for... 1.6 million builders in the middle of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually be launched, she would “stretch a thread to understand the functioning of an ant system to stop gangrene and identify those responsible”.
This process is characterized as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices.
The way we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes, for his part, that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the Quebec electoral campaign reaches 70 per cent, he joked, "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit to $100 a donation to the parties, but it said it would not change the situation: “Until we severely limit the election costs, there will be dirty money.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of public contracts and the financing of parties: “We cannot go down below; we are boldly encroaching on things, and we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PJG - not FK Barcelona!"
This season, you made an unusual move in the FGM.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be a new dimension of the FGM.
The big players are here.
I grow next to them every day.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning, at the pre-primary training centre in Clerfonten and before I arrived in St. Etienne, I was always moving forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancholotti...
It's not a very high-level match to make up for this summer.
They also know that each exercise is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be at the level and to be at the most.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's been assisted by deputies like Claude McElele, who played in the same position that I did.
Ancholotti is the master of the situation?
Sure.
Ancholotti respects all technical personnel.
He has no equal in the First League today, and he is among Europe's best coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season of FGM?
In the First League, Leon took our leader's place.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified in one eighth of the finals.
What's the club's purpose in this tournament?
We'll try as hard as we can.
Anything can happen now.
We can say our word to the person with the very good European teams.
First, we want to finish the first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the game back in one eighth of the finals.
Could FGM become a top European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure long-term positions.
It's not like that today.
In financial terms, the FGM has the means to make this project real.
Should I take the title in the First League, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assume the title of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the strong teams such as Marcel, Leon, and Bordo who fought for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for the FGM?
It's normal for us to expect a lot, given how much was invested and what kind of players we have.
We're ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Tru, and we find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask what people expect of us first.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 bill.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, whose two seasons have failed in one eighth of the finals, even though they have spent a great deal of money too!
Given the amounts we have invested, we have presented you for 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who were not high last season, were “excited” by this new FGM.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The FGM seems to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovich’s feats.
Well, if they say there's some kind of "Golden Dependence."
This simply means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he is killing many heads.
He's here to prove he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and star of the world.
In the group, we respect him as a human being and as a player.
He also respects people who surround him.
What he did was really exclusive.
This stimulates others to improve their play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro-2012 with the Complementary France?
It's a disappointment.
I wanted to be a part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting my time playing games.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I've come out stronger.
I'm doing a good team games today.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got some good positions in the team for the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to players, and he inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blan like?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal, he has qualified us in Euro.
I hope Didier Descham will lead the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1), ripped out on 16 October in Spain, is that a fundamental match?
This game has given us faith in itself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no matches like that in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The current cash exchange based on central banks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing them.
Furthermore, as often happens with these technologies, there is clearly a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is causing financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, developed by Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows the exchange of files between participants at one level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bittices to make donations or as a payment.
The Bitcoin Course, which reached a maximum of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning to about $10 today (courses indicated on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency published in October was interested in the system.
It describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “contesting with a dollar or a euro” and “like regular currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to advance video games that are earned in the game process or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network of Facebook has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes are both book holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, similar to an e-mail.
For each new payment only, the user may choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically using a dual key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent over the network.
A key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is the file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
The computers are taking a new transaction and adding a number to it before it's "hesit" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus rendered inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of fraud, the user wanted to pay twice the same amount of money (in less than ten minutes) very quickly, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
A computer that solves a problem receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly distributed in half by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to one hundred million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computing capacity.
The life of the network has already survived the take-offs and downs.
Bitcoin sites were attacked and the battle stations were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paimium, a real money-paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as wordpress blog-platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of the bitcoins are out of circulation.
Giant Sale was announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the benefit for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, thus making it cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just give us an address that you can “photograph and recognize” by phone, explains Pierre Nuaz, saying he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in the revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may turn out to be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB proposes, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be higher today if the system succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants whom we considered terrorists.
And we're alone, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local rebels, but they will no longer be there as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees through French credits, was in order.
Truck convoys and armoured personnel escorted helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attack on Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
They took control of the country at the time as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they have been surpassed by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our day as well.
The former Mojahides, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers taking over public lands to resell them under the construction of returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US sub-contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, want a government that doesn't belong to thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been successful in American generosity: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people need to be ensured, who do not want to return to the darkbed of old parties or to corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that watch everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities who will command her be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, on the basis of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
Industry has not been placed on its feet, no dam is functioning, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
All imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
State control of infrastructure would be necessary in a country that was destroyed during the thirty years of the war.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
It only increased the sense that Western countries were there just to conquer them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Medes of Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a vast Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, should restore normal relations on a one-day basis.
The withdrawal of French military units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French-language faculty at the university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to conquer hearts and minds and to achieve the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Civil War Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture to dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local workers, have been able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increased soils.
What will we keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, very severe in these valleys, often located more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order to rid themselves of the insurrections led by foreign groups, what farmers, as I was told, have to provide them with a small non-military support that is well controlled and accessible directly to them.
Hard births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Mursey's new risky move.
While Egypt was divided more than ever on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a va-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Soon, as Egypt had relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which had weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the separation of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusion” by continuing “to violate this word” and “to uphold the law”.
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should take place for fifteen days.
A very short period of time that makes the Brethren renounce the intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsey seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in one interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote goes to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "If you vote in favour of my text, or if I leave extraordinary powers", which are supposed to end after the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to deliver their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the required quorum to be achieved, 11 reserve participants were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
No wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, delayed the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose about... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were wrong.
The text on which the vote was yet to take place yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article in the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace “rules” with “rules” which would allow for more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
Personality, the liberals who see it are only the piranhas.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of laws to sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pomje, this is alarming, i.e. “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can see the origin of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
We remain with this constitution within the framework of civil law.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text were not olemy, but university students, some were taught in the French system" - reassures Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “about article 220, there may be ambiguities, as the terms used in the article are derived from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to “fictions” [Islamic jurisprudence, in particular.]
In the future, there may be a question as to how many civilian judges are competent to make decisions on this matter.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have declined considerably compared to what they were in the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will take place, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Responsibilities for blasphemy have been maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles referred to the protection of women anymore, emphasized Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was due to speak on television last night, the events are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will take the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the Pup of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the splendor of Bible truths, modern comforts, and natural perfection.
The AIF identified five of the most important reasons why we should be in Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, needs to be visited.
It is believed that God’s grace will descend upon all who enter this “bought. ”
And Galilee is the place of the wonders of Jesus: the turning of water into wine at the wedding, the walking of water, the calming of the storm, and the filling of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all, the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
Believers here go through the Path of Scorby or the Cross Path of Jesus.
It begins at the fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where there was judgment, and leads to the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgophe, to the place of crucifixion, the Anointing Stone, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Paradise of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made the cross to crucify Jesus was growing.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, Stan Placha, who remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people leave notes of wishes here, which are later fulfilled.
Make a vertical trip
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained secret from the enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
They are located on suspension rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
Only those who engage in mountaineering can get to them.
The rest of you will be delivered to this historic peak on the canath road.
In the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon mountain resort at 1600-2040 metres, where in winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus is delivered to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the track is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in that country.
You don't go on one trip to all of them.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located not far from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
Its exhibition is widely represented by the canvas of Monet, Piszarro, Renuara, Cezanne, Sisleya, Mathissa, Modillani, Chagala, Picasso.
In Acco you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is a few halls of old Turkish baths with visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth going to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir benches.
The entrance is free and donations are not categorically accepted.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Jad-Yours in Tel-Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, a children ' s memorial, is a memorial of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the Hebrew children and the names of the countries in which they were killed.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get Well
The three main resort areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceaniums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is heated to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, where they bathe for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet, at 417 metres below ocean level.
The laser water in it is a brine that can easily swim without even swimming at all.
The landscapes around here are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water, rappa, and cerebrovascular dirt, and cure the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and diabetes.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
The ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo, is on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It has led to the famous Seaway, linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of walking along narrow alleys named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you lean on the walls of the street "your" sign, Fortuna will be a favor.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries in photo sessions.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can travel through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Visitor to the Note
When going to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: in the country, about 30 per cent of the population speak Russian.
Money travel is better not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground hoodie.
All modes of urban transport cost 6 shekels for which you can travel with transplants for 1.5 hours.
On Saturday, Sabbaths are celebrated in Israel by Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation stop.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher dishes, excluding pork, seafood, uncushioned fish and dishes, where milk and meat are mixed.
It offers a wide selection of lamb and beef, soups and desserts prepared for coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste humus, various sauces, nut shells, falalale, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of food-fed cats that have nothing to do with walking on their own.
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlicians love places of life and do not give up the benefits.
The rental of the car, depending on the stamp, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike ride is going to be 15 cheques a day.
The museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from around the world.
The most important journeys and holidays were made by citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
On Earth, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, a 51 per cent increase in the 2010 figure before visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants digging money into language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that they will give the law on compulsory language testing, there have already been frauds trading “lip” certificates
Each year, 13 million gastrometers arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their sole goal is to make money to support families left home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force that would require every migrant worker to pass a Russian language examination.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing, household and retail sectors.
In time, however, the FMC promises, tests will be mandatory for all arrivals.
Not only would it be necessary to give up the language but also Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language would have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of those countries where the Russian is the State language.
The law and people who were successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefit, Conciliation and Protection of Rights
The Network of Examination Points will work under the auspices of the Russian Institute of the Name Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the ICU, the SPBSU and other Russian institutions.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
Both the members of the State and the FMC supported the test initiative.
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: What will that actually do?
What will change the mandatory language for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service is responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian Federation Mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without a language that does not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant is doomed to face unfaithful people who, in the form of help, will move his “travel” into a thick, narrow barracks where he and dozens of such ones will be lurking for months without food and documents, rolling 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing in their country, and they are being lied to on their arrival, taken by passports, not paid the promised salary”, the Chief of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov, confirms.
Don't fight, you.
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics are collecting earnings in Russia, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country they seek but they write in their own writings with difficulty.
Of course, it's not as much their fault as it is their trouble: few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even strong primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention that they are good at dressing, dressing, and supplying them to school.
As they grow up to their teens, they go to work at the earliest opportunity.
It's hard, if it's bad with the knowledge of the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inadequate."
True, there is one important point about the law on the language of human rights defenders.
Testing will only be done for migrants in legal status.
If there is no status, there will be neither examination nor subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastrometers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or the Foreign Entrance is denied."
Many of the arrivals claim that it is not that easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
Also, legalization costs money, ranging from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And here's a fake registration that can be done quickly and only for half a thousand.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, no extortions.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a Tajik citizen, Umed Kushkadamov.
"Pull in, don't focus, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “lip” language test certificates have already been seized by FMC staff.
Fake paper is printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they have been given no advantage to new owners: each of the migrants who so hoped to ease the task of passing the tests has paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice the cost of official testing: it will cost a migrant working in three thousand.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “shorts” cannot be simply bought, brought together both the authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise those who failed to pass the test for the first time, time to learn basic language courses.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The IMF does not take into circulation the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
Russia's IMF proposes to tighten the law with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: Pushing shots at weddings when there were no casualties, and fighting by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
Police want to ban trauma in public places and raise the age from which they can obtain a licence for weapons from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Thought Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption of Corruption, Irina Jaroway, and promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be made to the State of the Congo in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by means of the “curdling gajek”.
An open letter appeared on the web, the authors of which, as representatives of various social small organizations, demand that there be no “sensitivity”.
The percentage of gun-recorded bullying is minimal, according to Russian BBC criminalist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, during the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered in internal affairs, while 1168 000 crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation on civilian weapons does not allow the offender to go to the “black” market.
They now say that any weapon at a low cost can be found in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains that they control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is being filled through several channels.
The main channels are five, according to the Colonel in his resignation, Victor Barañec, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Genstab.
Show site receiving arms orders
The first is "armian or military trail," which is the weapon that was stolen during the hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were seized by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from power forces.
The Baraan explains that these include the police warehouses that were stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal “walls” are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had explosions.
"There are proven versions that part of the fires have been made specifically to cover up the failure," says the former military.
According to the Baranz, weapons manufacturers make their contribution.
“Now private weapons factories are being produced that do not withstand competition on the international market and are throwing their weapons out of the field into the black market, including Moscow”, the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially do guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and there is a mob that organized the flow," the former military explains.
Where did you get the guns?
Experts considered the approximate proportion of each source of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts reviewed the reporting of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Federation, criminal literature and open portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, come from the army and forces.
Half of all weapons in the black market were “the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report said.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of cases of weapons come from areas of armed conflict, 14 per cent of cases involve arms theft, 5 per cent from “black archaeology”.
A consultant from one of the gun stores who asked not to name his name assures me that the guns found by black diggers have long since been bought are too old.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers go to a military warehouse for a new party.
Through a banner, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They write it out, pass it through the canister.
"He's moving her into town and here he's selling 900 euros for a thing with two stores," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the crime detection plan is under way, the illegal arms dealers are being purchased,” the consultant adds.
"How's the luxury store?"
The seller and buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a friend who offered to come to the "God" platform, where there's a guy who's gonna take me to the corner where we're gonna trade.
The price of the trunk I found was only there.
Military Observer Viktor Barañec
To get the gun, I need a friend who's got a way out, says a consultant seller.
There are vendors in the markets, but there is also a need to come, conditionally, from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell his daughter that his tooth fell out.
I'm getting some caste right now through a man I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me because he knows I won't give them up.
Newbies are looking for guns in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranetz tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article on this subject.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to the Baranz, doesn't offer a cat in a bag, anything can be tried.
I'm a potential customer, not just shopping - we're going with the seller into the woods, there's a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure that the weapons are beating well, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Extruder shop
Demands on the Internet are placed on Web sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for various purposes.
This does not require documents and personal meetings.
"Sufficient to have a certain amount of money" is written in a commercial hat on the website "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are they gonna sell to minors?
“Unlicensed” - asks the user “Ivan” (orthography retained).
"Buying TT.Moscow" - lacquerly formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now launched a vast network of base sites that would like to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military Observer and Former Military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photograph and an instruction where weapons are hidden,” says Dr. Dimitri Kislov, Spokesman of Public Organization.
Viktor Baranetz claims that if you leave an application on the site, you can stay unarmed and get behind bars.

A $100 Makarov.
The purchase of illicit small arms is estimated at between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislova of Right to Weapons, the Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It's gonna take a month and a half to wait.
It shall be unloaded from storage warehouses of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official statistics from January to October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent and stood at 22.9 per cent, while the number of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8 per cent.
Fastfood and supermarket workers visit the United States
The McDonald's cashier goes to about a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart and fast food restaurants, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendys and Kentucky Fried Chiken.
As long as no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or is destined to die in the early stages.
Stocks are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages paid by regular Walmart workers and the fast food system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
Until now, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, captured by millions of invaders and sometimes accompanied by carousels.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work around the world for 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picked up with trade unions and left activists, had a corporation that had a small and medium surplus.
Walmart sells everything in the light, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees are only burdened at work.
Walmart was one of the largest corporations in the Americas.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods to the store partly because he doesn't pay his employees much.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as shortages of motor-loaders or hand-held scanners.
Shareholders on Black Friday demanded that the salary be increased and suggested that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, that's not a pocket payment, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it'll cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she's spending on pay right now.
If Walmart shifts the wages on the buyers' shoulders altogether, he'll only cost them 46 cents more every time he goes to the store.
A year from now, they're going to spend $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart's supporters are quite aware that the protests took place only in nine states and did not do any harm to the corporation.
The Black Friday continued in her shops from 8:00 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, argued in an interview with Huffington Post, that jobs had left a total of less than five Walmart employees, and that the protest had been a “monetary pianist trick” organized by her union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart (they are not sorry in this progressive city, and that is why they are not here yet), but by McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick people and pay you for your honest work!
June Williams, member of the New York Horsutto
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants have been increased over time, but few, and on average their regular workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one makes less money in this expensive city.
How can you be in New York for that kind of money? It's impossible for me.
Once upon a time, there were almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for them after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly faced with interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they should live on that salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are feeding them.
The protesters, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast food system start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast food.
The American law prohibits administrations from obstructing and punishing trade unionists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult for the union to embrace fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main is the unusual turnover of staff.
Non-consenting
Sound protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
In the middle of the day, a rally was held at McDonald's next to the Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, in particular a member of the Mountain Council, Jumein Williams, who said, "Macdonalds" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick people and doesn't pay you for honest work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, said that "we must join together in supporting fast food workers in order to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!".
As the New York Times described, this was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people were involved, and not all of them were workers of a fast public education program that employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark generates the flames of mass movement.
"As long as the brain is lying, it's average."
The recent topic of complemented reality among worshipers of modern technology was largely accepted through the prism of special points.
First, at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
However, the conversation with the leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft Sharam Izadi Cambridge Laboratory indicates that the score is the last step for scientists in this company.
Their prospects for manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Would you please tell me in general what your research team is doing?
- We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind is in the mass, they are stuck at the point of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes tiptoe in them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else is waiting for us?
- Although Kinect has transferred the interaction to the physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output has not been very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular stuff, but aren't they overestimating it?
- It's definitely not called a panacea - it's a matter of privacy, because it doesn't always want to tell people about what they're doing and what they're doing.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in his niche.
For example, in order to manage devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not over mammoth ones, but over such expensive, short ones.
The gestures were removed, not by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatches.
But in general, the future behind a mixed type of management, such as a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how would you ask me to give you this gas can?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what they can or can't right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work largely to develop new types of sensors that will enable us to define human reactions more precisely.
These could be laser sensors, for example, they give a good deep resolution, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on modern cameras?
Is there no permit, no depth or anything?
- In principle, the current generation is what we can draw from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get a megapixel 8 at a rate of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So you need to remember not only the X and Y authorization, but also Z.
It's also a very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor for controlled processing delay from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands the impact that this has on human and machine interaction.
In my work, I could use the equivalent of such a device, but it doesn't require a touch to make staff a second longer.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera is actually the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculation.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its points to the audience.
Don't you think, in terms of everyday use of eye-response technologies, that's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time you're walking, holding the smartphone up in your arms, it's not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "crossing" completed reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from a score to a smartphone, a projection display and everything.
The glasses are a very personal device, in which they are powerful (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - complemented reality based on points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of the Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often criticized: there is no tactile response!
The hands can't feel anything!
What are the answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that complemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be a touch of tactile sensation.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as an image pad.
She's excellent at recording the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to make these "air cards" imaginative -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you've been blown to the pillows.
And there are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which are also a promising direction.
- Were you trying to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that.
There is another challenge that needs to be fought for a long time — how to get a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite path — to work on the concepts of escape routes (not at all like clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as the brain is lying, it's average work for many years.
This is what makes the virtual reality so attractive to a researcher -- a lot of things in an absolutely early state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rossbalt is continuing the St. Petersburg Avant-garde project, which focuses on the citizens ahead of it in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top-list has already included bright characters of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing from the Russian world.
The new hero of "Rosbalta" is the empathetic artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, the bearded man dressed in all the red, who meets at the Russian Museum, the Garden of Summer, the fashioned carcases and latrines.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators wherever they go.
Kirill Miller is one of the mere St. Petersburg socio-Philosophy tellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man in the late '80s of St. Petersburg, early '90s.
In addition, he is a city man with a smile on the streets that cheers the city and cheers everyone up.
Recently, he took hold of a charm and became a Petersburg charmer, for he had matured for this difficult role all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you still walking around town in all red, not yellow or brown, for example?
- I chose red as a modeler who deals with vision and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and society.
While everything in society is almost gray, it is an act of aggression and instigation of bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in Nevsky DC, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
At that time, the waves of the old free informal artists passed, and the new, free-like ones were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason that led to Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me in theaters, clothes, music, all genres, except for the word.
It was important for me to feel at the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative powers should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Pushkinska 10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a botched club, a home of the peterburg goddess, while there were no repairs.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tekila-jaz, I remember Schnura being brought in with the Van Gogh Ear project.
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a stretching shirt, among which was the fashionable composer Igor Wdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the lead of many programs until the Halli-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he got a big career, and he got basic education and education.
The "D 137" gallery, the "Griboedov" club, is an echo from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and forever gone.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the interview was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the Nominee of the Year, I was called, and my culmination ended.
In new times, the old rules make it impossible for me to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, we can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is well-known.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're clearly relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a program show, "Russia Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an out-of-time category.
I used to be social, now being that way is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything gets spoiled. Tragic.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving peace through totalitarian dress-up in command.
The dress is now found in the outer mechanics rather than in the inner person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the bud.
And the deception will be lifted with a change of clothes.
And we recently saw you as a town charmer.
To whom, not me, they should be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Business art must now be neat, tactical, sweet.
There's disintegration of cultures.
People used to fight in rooms, the gods loved one another, the simplets.
Now they're all broken up into micro-communities, and now it's hard for everyone to like it.
I'm not a hundred dollar paper to everybody like.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
And there's a few grand coming to Stasa Mihailova!
He's got brooches coming in, and the sex-social area is working.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and ultimately less management, less money, everything will go.
I've got worshipers, the important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the stuff they've been using.
I used to write pictures like this when I was a kid that one of the collectors had on the wall next to Falco and Larion's hanger.
I started with paintings that usually end.
There's a lot of confusion now.
They say that culture is spiritual, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money to paint paintings.
I'm in charge of this culture.
- Cyril, what's wrong with St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion of an official from a culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
With the right kings, the kings may not have understood the culture, but they understood the need to hold the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they're on the move, because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them the road.
Now the taster is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted by us, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer thinner.
We need to make fashion art like it was in the early part of the last century.
Project implemented at St. Petersburg Grant
To Be Born in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
Spaceships being driven with earthmen on board are being sent to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how do we continue our descent in a state of ignorance or on the same reserve planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars”, according to Senior Researcher of the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Schternberg (GAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, the surface of Venus is at a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The issue of reproduction in outer space has begun with flora.
More than half a century ago, plant experiments were conducted.
Four generations of pea growing in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, the introduction into orbit of insects, tiny fruit fly drozophiles.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in a state of unconsciousness.
We're getting a completely normal bird out.
And here comes the problem.
“The problem of this bird finding resistance is that it has to get on its feet and start moving”, explains R.R. Vladimir Sychev, the head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
I couldn't find any resistance, and the birds were crumbly.
And 10 hours later, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the birds, and then we refused because it's just impossible to work there with them," notes Vladimir Sychev, a failure to experiment with birds in space.
The last time a biological miniskigae flew into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, there will be only one-half persons on the biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such research must be done," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, there was a progeny in the space rats.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not easy.
Animals, losing their habit, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our Tchaika has flown away, and no one on Earth could have said if it would have remained after flying into space.
If she's going to have a baby after this flight.
“No one answered that question,” said a veteran of the missile and space industries Wakhtang Wačnze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentin Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
Andrian Nikolayev's father was also an cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitzka, was born twice in orbit and even working in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have many units, there's cosmonauts, and after long flights, there's a healthy generation.
“And if more, it’s dangerous even in orbital flights” is the result of the pilot cosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov.
Yet, mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CHP Hydrolaborator is a mandatory phase of preparation for flight.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, cosmonauts work out the skills of open space.
The water mimics the faintness.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but it's still a foreign environment, it's a line of birth for breast children.
The little goutians seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There's a connection between having a baby for about nine months with a mother in an fertilized liquid, making it easier for her to get used to the water.
It makes sense, in principle, because since birth, from the moment of the first bath, it's only been two weeks.
“It’s too little to forget,” says a breast - swimming instructor, Marina Axenov.
In other words, if the child is not born with a more natural condition, gravity, gravity, and gravity are necessary for the woman.
Very quickly, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to push the fetus are drained.
All right, let's drop this by relying on birth-stimulators.
Of course, in a special cell, you can have a baby, and it'll squeeze it out.
"And what else?" asks the non-tribal questions of Valery Polacks.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of attraction on earth, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is impossible for a newborn to wear a special load suit in orbit as an adult.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs for life.
“And this experiment, which we will go to with you, when we allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the bringing to Earth of a disabled, completely desolated person”, will be provided by the head of the bioethics committee of IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in outer space is a question of theory.
In time, however, this will be a reality when the earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in outer space.
Head of the General Audit and Audit Office: The Schwarz system has failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good controls and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit and Audit Office, from an interview for the current site.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," he commented on the current situation of Kala.
The joint inspection of the Czech and German monitoring bodies provides such findings.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter Nesto’s approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb entrepreneurs by checking - is this prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions to which it is required to verify and seek compliance with the obligations,” said Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It means a parallel check we started probably two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation affirms how public procurement is to be undertaken, national legislation and then application in practice are further followed.
All the information has been collected and, even with the pending verification, there have been interesting differences - more simply, we may have “accurate and flawless” legislation, but in the practice of applying certain parameters, we are giving in to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, and it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project actually help you what it means to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not result in a positive outcome.
Economics means obtaining the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) cost to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But not the fact that we will achieve this has reduced the restrictions on orders.
This system may be filled with paper so that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not go down.
You are referring to domestic problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our KRU (Control Audit Office) or is it working differently?
With regard to the agencies, there is also a committee that works a little differently as our CRU, but basically both institutions operate in a similar manner.
In addition, powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level, in which their system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for local legislation, it's easier than we have?
In fact, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be said that it's better at all.
Is that because they're better in control?
Definitely not, but I'll say again, I don't like the comparison.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from working with our office, would they?
In terms of domestic legislation, how has your institution been affected by the amendment to the Public Procurement Act been affected in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our monitoring work.
Since we control the fact, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits, and we started using our new tool of finding the risk of ineconomy, through which we drove out almost 14,000 public contracts, and we analyzed them, and of course these changes will appear because restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or add to the pressure on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will become more severe” and cannot be respected.
In the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - to the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the procurement law entails a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be strengthened in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system must exclude those who want to seize and abuse but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us be aware that this path will not go anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs by checking the so-called quartz system.
"Swartz System" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister may not oppose the work of the bodies to which it is required to verify and seek compliance with the obligations.
You could say, "We change this law and we solve it," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules as to what should be formally implemented, and that is correct; it will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which in my opinion we lack.
The roads are slippery but mostly slippery.
In some places Czech roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but somewhere with more caution.
Carlovarian Region
This morning in the Carlovar region, the roads were under way, but some are frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it must be warm.
Snowfall has ceased in the region, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
On the ridges of the Red Mountains, however, there is about a foot [30 cm] of snow.
From information received from regional road workers, it was known that the places were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads in the region are currently without restrictions.
However, caution is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be cold and slippery.
Also, all roads relating to the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are accessible.
But some of their sites still have cold and snow - laden remains.
Especially should you be on high - altitude roads.
Pardubice and King's Landing
The Czech Highway and Motorways Authority on its website informs that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened with hunger, and on mountain roads and high roads, there may be a snow - layered snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of famine, which may occur especially at the heights of the Pardubice Region.
Hunger may be around Lanshcroun, Usti nad Orlici, Policki, Sweetawi or High Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitava, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and Orlicki Mountains.
The snowed layer is located on roads situated on high altitudes in the areas of Rikhnova nad Knezhno and Trutnova.
In eastern Czech Republic today, a variable cloud without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, the light wind.
Plsenski kraj
Roads in the Plzeń Region this morning go by, but places need to be alert and adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
In places, drivers may encounter a mist, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now almost unlimited, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and extinct surfaces.
South Pilsen and Tahoe may have frozen areas.
The second and third classes are wet, and in this case there is also a warning about the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the high point of the Olomouc Region today must take into account the snowy mush on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea saddle and on the road towards Viselle Kršíž.
During the night of the snowfall, some three centimeters [three cm] of snow fell on the street of road workers.
In other areas of the edge of the road, usually without restrictions.
"There are snow leftovers on the highlands of Shumperac.
Drivers heading towards Esenika should be aware of the snowy mess in the Redlegic Sedla,” CHAN (Czech News Agency) said today.
During the night, their colleagues from Essenika went to clean the roads and assured them that the roads in the highlands after treatment had remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are unfettered, but in Sternberk, drivers must be alert to forest areas where humidity still persists.
Ostrich Region, Liberec Region
Road workers from northern Bohemia report this morning that there are still some difficult places to go.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with an ice cream or snow falling, the upper road is closed at the Telenica site in the Usteck Region Clinic.
The temperature also stays negative in the lowlands, so on the roads there is snow and ice, in the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Republic, on the other hand, there are no problems, roads mostly dry.
Road complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report the appearance of hunger in the vicinity of Damage.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained all day, and it kept snowing, and at night the sky was clear, and the frost began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on main highways and on Route I/13 on the border of Usteck and Liberec.
Because of the snow - covered branches of the trees on the road itself, they were forced to close the road to Télnica at Knice.
At concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
Together with The Tap Tap Group, we are always joking about this, and we say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential possessed by the Maya calendar, which was declared at 11:10 on 21 December.
On the day before that, on December 20th, at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava were held in parallel.
They end up, roughly, at a time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours early than ours, will complete the May calendar.
Who's got that idea?
At first it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist, Gonza Augusto.
In addition to trying to store enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world is being handed over to our children.
At the end of May's calendar, we created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, has also performed an an anthem against the end of the world called the End of Light.
Will YouTube-like hymns be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it all comes together and the world doesn't end.
It's captured by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
At the same time, the hymns will also sound on the direct air of Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the Thomas Ganak video, and Xindl X also participates in the performance...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with other Czech cultural people, as we are conducting many charitable activities and concerts.
We are actively trying to involve them in these projects.
It turns out that many of us like to work with us, they like to work with us.
What's the benefit from the concert against the end of the world?
For the sixth year, we have been working with the Tap Civil Association at the Edlicki Institute to buy equipment for a barrier-free STUDEO educational centre.
Teachers regularly attend school students at the Edlichki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, so we try to give them the opportunity.
In the future, a separate building will be created within the Edlicki Institute ' s additional construction project, to which we will move with the project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dan Bart, The Tap Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suhi will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “great events” in the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to make a presentation at the Czech national house in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago personally, if we are in the United States.
About the border, you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the baggage compartment, plus a large number of goods and instruments.
Nevertheless, as long as the Czech airlines of ČSA and British Airways have managed without a problem, they have always been excellent for us, and I have been surprised at how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went fine.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that it is still at the base level in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are still very many barriers, and there is still an independent movement of a man on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There's no such thing as walking off the road by a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, public organizations are already in the process of drawing people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we have to catch up with the leading countries all the time?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own in the streets, to go to the bathroom, to a museum, wherever...
It is not very common that many people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in which we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrierism is one thing, but when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really change.
As long as it's a one-time thing, it's people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but we're going back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to Edlichki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing on a saxophone, I and my colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our leading Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of hand.
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
It's true, we've been helped by the fact that we've started joining famous singers and working actively on the propaganda of the group.
We've come to the conclusion that work that no one can assess is essentially nonexistent.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of turning The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential for doing something extraordinary.
In Shaw business, it's full of things that are like each other.
It makes sense, all new things are taken with caution, and it's been going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, pity, is naturally...
But this pity is unnecessary, because people with limited capabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them, it's for society as well.
Have you been successful in being a strong leader, as many think you are?
If we want to do our work qualitatively, we must be uncompromising and disciplined in many things.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic performances and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend preparatory courses, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
At present, a group of The Tap Tap Twenty.
How many were there in early 1998?
Just one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 2010/12, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno, in the Fléda and Ostrava Club, in the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by the telethon at the time of the song of the band The Tap Tap “The End of Light Is Over”.
The aim of the project is to raise 25 million crowns of funding for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicki Institute in Prague.
It costs 400 kroner tickets for children under the age of 12 free of charge.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space voyages, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas in Warsaw's astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933 from his innovative work "Introduction into space".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years Sterfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Award for "Introduction into space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 66), mentioned earlier, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-famous space propagandist, and his contribution was assessed, including the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named in his honour.
By 1925, a railway train equipped with a rocket engine had already been built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear even that a rocket was to be used to launch or brake the trolley.
The information on this cloth is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzicki.
It is evident from the retained evidence that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, a specialized press had the idea of a photoelectric surveyor rocket proposed by an engineer named Rogozinski, and the following year the work of “Aircraft torpedo and air bomb rocket” was published by the author of Llivy-Kivobločka.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, the interim scientific advisory committee (Temporary Advisory and Scientific Advisory Committee), which coordinated all the work, was involved in all military-use projects.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautic Society).
For the first time, society is mentioned in November 1954, issue of The Problem, which publishes four volumes of articles on astronauts.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovic offered to organize a society that would engage in space.
At the time, artificial satellite projects had already been built into circulation, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since early 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has attempted to join the international Astronautics Federation (based in 1951) and has already become a valid member of the PIA in autumn.
And next year, the first President of the PIA, Kazimez Zarankevich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his very death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, PIA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologicala), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently constructed, and in the summer of 1959 two-step RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 metres long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do the actual scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could have overrun 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM rockets were inherited by Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (identified as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B was 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C was 0.62l.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a starting weight of 380 kg, was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (the Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaschevski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The regulation sparked a lively discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and the free, free movement of private capital, together with unfettered financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) there is a price voltage.
The concept must be understood when a producer is trying to compete in economic competition by delivering cheap goods by pushing the value of a competitor to take out a large part of the market and thus to increase his own income.
This means, on a massive scale, for the majority of entrepreneurs, either the transfer of production abroad, or the cost of purchase abroad, or the disappearance, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
As private capital bears no social responsibility, including for unemployment, the inevitable social costs of the State are increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of the employers ' masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the social and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for specific statistics.
Unscrupulous private capital methods create situations at the level of individual economies where Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are placing their own populations on arbitrary private capital despite social decline.
This is reflected first and foremost in the changes to existing legislation.
The objective is to make its people submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in labour law.
As a result, poverty levels have increased, while the gap between the poor and the rich has also increased.
In the FWG, there has been a public distribution of products to the poor who have not been able to feed themselves with their own labour for several years.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always instances where employed persons receive such wages that the State must pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has also been known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same situation in which people under pressure from a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to have their wages in poverty at the backs of society, in the hope that private investment will ever come to the country.
But I wonder where he's going to come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will either move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African are still working for the share of European wages.
This is true throughout Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media predominately argue that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy by acting as managers.
Further, the question should be answered as to whether private capital, now practically governing politics and the whole State, for its own selfish purposes, is in place.
The same answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and intrusive lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a bottomless situation of corruption, of mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In the FWG, the situation is that public ministries, owing to lack of funding, entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by Bundestag.
All power is based not on the people, as the Western Constitution states, but on financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly emerging in the situation as described by the Appian in the work “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeia”: “The State has long broken up and the agencies are dealing with violence.
Seizures, illegal receiving of mercy through stones and swords.
"...good people have not run for the post of ruler at all, and in the end, the State has lost its consul for eight months.". "Surely they have begun to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is self-government and the need to choose an energetic man.". Appian thought it would be Pompey, but he became Caesar, who finally changed democracy to self-state.
As in ancient times, present society has its own reckless interests without taking public interests into account.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the Fascist and Communist regimes is that we must seek to liberalize economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, followed by the next tour.
At the outset, it is tragic that the current elite is totally ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under competition pressure at both the international and the national and European levels, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is political and social reforms aimed at strengthening the State ' s share of the economy, strengthening the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weakening the monopoly on private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" -- Sting, song called "Hrupkei", where the main verse of the chorus is, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want a war, they wouldn't be there," "the dying Gutel Schnapper, Meer Amschel Rothschild's wife.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, sparked many responses.
Some advocate Israel for its position by arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others supporting Palestinians by arguing with the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, while the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who in these recurrent waves of killings is a criminal and who is the victim, after all, of today's Israeli citizens, including self-governed territories, were born at the moment of the political situation and were not witnesses to the onset of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtains, to see who has been under 95 years of stress (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East land.
Some of my reasonings are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of power struggle.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne, was someone who had guided their actions to their intended goals.
We should be allowed to live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lives of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as the head of a rod (I don't know if there's anyone above them, but it's not excluded) - Rothschild.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The First News Agency (Rates) had already purchased in the 1990s to stop the rumours that link their name to the criminal activities in the higher spheres in which they were located, and that have always led to the strengthening of their power, the accumulation of wealth, or at the same time, and to others.
They have large stocks in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks they do not have their share, they wage or prepare war (until the invasion of Afghanistan there were only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were five countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took its central bank into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began releasing his own (understand government) money and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (federal reserve system), was killed in 1963, and Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to bring the FED to trial for the opening of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, established by Albert Pike, the great Mason of the 33rd.
The objective of the first war was the destruction of the monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the British, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to provide their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families working with the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Wangered throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarrantedly and economically, with Germany's surrender (no longer required war to destroy the royal Russia) and, consequently, the fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the disbanding of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the debilitating masses, then it was only to throw the Germans in a strong enough, criminalized position and offering simple solutions by the Chief, to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to function as the Fifth Column, in fueling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to create the Jewish State, preferably in the historical Jewish area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration of Balfour created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, starting to clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains where he was initially held by bankers or what he had done, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State by the international community.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was declared to create the fatherland of the Third War.
If international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, like in World War II, would be the victim of fighting on the front lines, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the abuse creates resentment in an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers have put people to vote in the election exclusively of their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of the Netanyahu Hawk is a typical example of Fascist, loyal international bankers who are doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to develop into a world conflict, and given Iran's control of the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20% of all world oil reserves (a navigation corridor of only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words given by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order”.
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where each born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes an entity under total control.
"And He causes all the small and great, rich and poor, free, and slaves to have a stain on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not mentioned by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, may not buy or sell.
That is wisdom. Anyone with a mind can calculate the number of beasts.
For it is in harmony with the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When there is nowhere else, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic Democrat students captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrow of Mohamed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the U.S. Revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw chess overboard because it could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to secure the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow against the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections that culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, cut by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that America has won with small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six workers were able to escape.
After a difficult period, they finished their journey in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story that they took on Canadian passports as members of a survey team who were looking for a place to take pictures of a science and fictional epic.
A combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez, the evacuation expert, invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be reliable, specialized journals wrote about the film project, organized press conferences, and an imaginary production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleka's movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called film cinema, the story of a good story, an affair, an example of a series of films about Ouschen's friends.
The film constantly changes moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the titres show significant historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - no big difference in this).
On the other hand, eased Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- the men in the suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating table, on the institution stairs, on the phone...
Ben Afflek was great at starting his career.
From the ridiculed actor he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be a laughingstock.
Operation Argo's third feature film, after the dark detective "Good-bye, baby, good-bye" (2007) and the Triller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first movie by Affleka that's not made in the hometown of the director, Boston.
At the same time, the feeling of the atmosphere is related to the qualities that promoted earlier film directors over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the embassy's fall impress with its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when there is a sudden change in history.
The similar effects of Afflek and his colleagues are achieved in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not involve a lot of film-taking scenes.
He's doing pretty well with this little thing, and sometimes he's figuring something out -- it doesn't work so elegantly (the scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the chase on the runway looks pretty ingenuity).
The shortage of Argo is dissension, which involves the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are indeed very accommodating, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Afflek's film lacks a little drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating production and retro style, which recreates the thrillers of the '70s.
But it's hard.
In fact, that is enough to remind us of one thing, still in the familiar sense of living history, as well as of the exaggerated perceptions of all-powerful and all-knowing services.
Air balloons, bananas and Circusses
The web portal www.bankkovnipoplexy.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd order or project from the EU’s workshop”.
"We have been encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said Questionnaire Patrick Nager's “right” organizer.
Among the absurdities already put forward is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are less objectively at risk for insurance companies.
"The further incredible ideas from the EU Masters can be put out for competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” said Nager.
EU disputed orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury-grades only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a smoke cell, which resulted in significant egg travel this year.
The actual prohibition of the use of the term “butterbrood oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps was also criticized.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (so the Czech Republic is now at risk of vetoing the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and were not allowed to show “anomalous curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by harmonising the existing divergent national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has, however, reduced standards on fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to the dumping of products.
Last year's EU regulation may also be the candidate for the prize, under which air balloons sold must be warned that children under eight years of age cannot overwhelm them without the supervision of adults.
The EU has asked for American studies that air balloons at play are the potential cause of death of children by strangulation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from smoking in fairies.
Fun Ideas Are Born and Home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is absurd enough: everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name “BURM” instead, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece.
The Bank'sPollachy.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, proposed the Laissez Faire for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the size of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum quantity of food stocks that may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the fixed quantities of preserved mushrooms, for which she was facing a large fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of granting grants for applications for grants.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not Brussels.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation", said then, in autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace (PMP).
As an argument, he indicated that the country had a high crop of grain, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks to be exported.
For Czechia to be far away from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
The grant was offered by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to be made for the formulation of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Curious orders are an exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, are, in the opinion of many experts, worth more recognition.
Experts believe that it is a serious problem to draw up EU grants for projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with deepening European integration, but which have been achieved by Member States in the discussion of the budget.
It is emotional to Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products specifically, and it does not always win this competition.
Although Czechs, after six years of fighting Germans and Austrians, have preserved the name Olomouc cheeses, but the Tuzem rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed Tuzemak.
Only products of cane distilette and not of sugar beet cane cane may be called rum.
The official EU list of registered products, along with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the German Lyubek marzipan or Parmian hamster, has already proved to be, for example, Carlovar drys, Pogorjelician and Treshbon rock and roaches.
The EU's trademark may also be proud of Pardubic spices and mustard pipes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get in his head to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how in the last 20 years the country has been developing, how thieves are fussing, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I am forty years old and an independent person who is not party to any party, I have no other option to influence matters than to run for the office of senator or president.
You're in the Senate, but you're about to go to the Presidential Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I kept saying that I would be involved in the struggle for a presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for presidents.
My goal is not a post; my position is an instrument through which I can carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and authority.
But the challenge is not only that we are a nation in a bar or a television set, but they are willing to kick anyone who tries to make a difference.
In addition, the media, who defile a person, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom of the lie, are added.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You have begun the struggle for the Presidential Castle with the notions of the political and criminal responsibility and the reverse property declarations of more than twenty million.
To do so, it is necessary to change the law.
You do not have such powers as President, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the tours to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately make obstacles to it, and that deters citizens.
As an independent party, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without a party flooring, without looking at the dogma, I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you're more of a right person or a left person?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people take me to the left rather than to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being on the right, it's about someone being on the left, it's about bringing people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether the HR Committee or the GDP will offer it, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove this by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You could call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with slogans.
And with that in politics, you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to trick them into our own.
Had I been elected President, it would not have been a problem to have a direct television broadcast in which I would appeal to the Presidents of Parliament ' s parties to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
If they refuse, they will have to report why they do not want to.
If there is a strong personality that will sound abuse, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President - it was a merit of public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies to assert my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting out in politics, and I'm going to try to get the majority support for my programme.
I am trying to move on my own; if I fail, I will be finished in six years and return to the private sector.
Part of that sounds like Okamura's supposed to save Czechia.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I went around a number of famous people offering to run for Senate.
I went to Radio Yanchure, he refused to do much work.
I also at least supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Lorentsov, who discovered fraud with light fuel products.
I put forward my candidacy because people really aren't happy, but now I feel like I'm weighty.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of those who went to the church chose representatives.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that the changes would be difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
You're thinking about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the cleanliness of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money for it.
There's no money in the presidential campaign, in my transparent account, only 22,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how do you handle your own business?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a section in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another eight million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb for a million, well, and a few million more.
By the way, Aston Martin showed up, because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, he was gallant with women, and at the same time, he was struggling against wickedness and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martin, you own 60 million assets, and you don't have any campaign money?
You're saying you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in that.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign is actually going to cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live for this money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to do business so you can live?
Did you not say that you would reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As promised, I've reduced my activities in part.
For example, the director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a mermaid who will keep the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting a month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were president, I'd end up doing business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's newspaper "Right."
The architects of MVRDV prove that the actual adventures are not only imaginary - for example, the Speykenisse and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building looks fun to me, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lizette Verheigh, on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large company nearby, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
Nobody goes to such old-fashioned libraries voluntarily now, right?
The Speckensse, the small bedroom under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest education level in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this boring situation, several years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted in euro banknotes, in the form of colorfully decorated iron-jereton miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to resist statistics: build a library here!
Vinny Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Bureau of MVRDV, the master of bold pillared diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took on the task of his usual insatiableness and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was puzzled by the look and the shoulders were clenched, the bold Maas composed of his original gift of the pyramid in size and completed his speech in defence of his project with the words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my suggestion, Book Mountain in Speykenis, so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million - euro mountain grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent dwellings and Townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the Grand Duchy Library of the Netherlands 2012.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national timber competition.
Thus, the immeasurable suburb, which had not previously been able to offer anything but the post-modern pedestrian zone and the surprisingly unbelievably beautiful town hall, whose white facades have been thought of as a dairy factory, have become richer for one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, the town's first cultural building in history has emerged.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a cheese cap.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, for true worshipers of architecture and reading prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glass on all sides of the room is light and easily visible, the fields of the broiled brick and elegant street lamps provide an unmistakable feeling of public urban square.
The city environment was created perfectly.
They look reluctantly for fossils, dogs, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
“The bookshelves are usually located along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually silent and impersonal,” says Winnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space on our head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is well used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the centre.
Black bookshelves, which serve as a wall section, are particularly happy with their parapets, and with ladders.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and builders are lost in conjecture, which is unknown material.
“We tried to work with secondary materials”, explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speykenisse community, according to the standard.
And once at an agrarian enterprise in Frisland, we met an appropriate by-product of agriculture.
For many years now, artificial fiber material of millimeter thickness has been used as a base in spasms and fields in the Netherlands as a base for roots.
It's cheap and it saves time.
A thin textile serves one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in such quantities, was pressed into a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called "landbauplasty" (KLP) is transformed into dark, homogeneous, durable material, slightly resembling a new car and a bit of a crosshair.
They're taking 105 degrees to the top.
Those who travel nearly 500 metres will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wood figurines in the hills.
They take care of the atmosphere, especially the correct air humidity on the literary mountain.
Costs of the new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project,” said Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Mount of Book stands under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun falls only for a short time.
Large, glued wood farms, situated perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on most of the sun’s rays.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic steering blinds.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verheigh was already here.
She also taught traditional Chinese medicine by Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg “the soul of Speykenisse who had long been missing”.
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to contribute a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take up empty seats on the shelves of the not yet fully completed library - at that time it contained 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The regiments are set up.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation now, every resident is in some way connected with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's for adornment only.
Thus, MVRDV has been able to solve the royal task, which is called the creation of an identity in a professional jargon.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, the US-Europe liaison expert, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first realized that it would vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli action in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relations with Israel.
At the same time, I believe that the American position is not supported either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO has implemented this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from a policy that the United States has been governed by, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the lack of an agreed common policy among Europeans.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just playing their part, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
This is the foreign policy that France or Britain is pursuing.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interest independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ greatly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be cautious not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, it was clear to the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in the light of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take this position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all thrilled by Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of a vital partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a single, non-contrary European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act as part of a broader approach and must instead act on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
In the future, I think Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
Clearly, it is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
The subject was always sensitive.
But I think the Germans clearly have a more independent role to play.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, will it really play a major role?
Or is Germany still hard to lead?
Germany is not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, there are a wide range of anti-German feelings.
The Germans are more than just coping with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, and this is not easy.
So, the U.S.'s influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it's not loving you, it's a life like this.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - the world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a fully registered name in China that has nothing to do with firms whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the holders of the original names have brought an action.
Yet, it is not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloh, Taylor Wessing’s lawyer, who specializes in trademark violations in the Far East.
Every week, on my desk, it appears in a new case of this kind.
It is sufficient for copycats to add only a few letters in order to obtain the right to register their trade marks.
Thus, from Gucci, Lu-Gucci can be registered instead of Prada Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports products, are legally copied.
Patloch opens a file with the registration records of the department of trade marks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
Large cities have multi-storey universities that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
On instructions from his trustees, however, he was opposed to having Chinese enterprises formally obtained from the department of trademark registration the right to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, the passenger brand.
This word is associated with the ban dakuan.
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
“It hurts the business, it has to be fought,” Patloch is convinced.
"The brand is washed away, the unique state is lost, the image is very badly affected."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, the removal of doubtful records in the trade mark register is difficult and costly.
The process may take up to nine years, with a vague outcome.
Patloch describes cases in which the court dismissed the claims, since after a long period of time the objected name became “market reality”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his trade mark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with Sana’s builder, an enterprise that had recently acquired Putzmeister’s concrete mill manufacturer.
Thus, Chinese still have the right to use a Mercedes-like emblem.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste’s fashion product manufacturer lost Chinese copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not find themselves guilty.
The record of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the shortage of personnel and equipment in the premises.
But last year, there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to a normal”.
For example, the number of pending cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It's worth fighting for.
As often in China, numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received over 1.4 million trade mark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide by 10 consecutive times, the agency reported.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million grand.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
The challenge is much more than that, according to the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have been able to find that their illegal production of counterfeit car parts has been eliminated.
However, the copycat established Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own omission, as the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Prime Minister of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The department of registration of CTMO trade marks rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following instances, but the other side continues to fight.
We need to be alert.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are unlikely to be taken into account, and the firm’s archives have had to be examined even by centuries of age to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite party a “high six-digit amount in euros” for a settlement.
"It is clear from this how expensive it is for us," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even to Europe.
In particular, if the copycats register unprotected trade marks there.
For example, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather products.
The concert has long ceased production in these areas, but has been able to prevent registration despite this.
"We need to be alert," says Ventzler.
Both Patloch and his lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on trademark protection, rather foreigners should “all that is worth protecting and also registering in China in any way”, says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it could cost more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses his last act of trade mark drama, he will have to pay license fees to the opposite party for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a contentious segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbunga choir rehearses, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
History of relations that have traveled more than 8,733 kilometres.
First, there is a sinking: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies’ boats and men’s shoes pick a beat on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers — alth, bass, tenor, and soprano — slowly grow — come in, charm, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, choir Imbunga rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age attended the rehearsal, from a genetic specialist to a palace.
Om "Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has its own text, also in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are some 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjan, the Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a boss.
It guarantees a child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot lunch at Gogo Centre.
Imbunga in Zulu means a storyteller or praiser.
They don't run around in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometres [8733 km] from Heidelberg, in the north-west of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitzini, which depends on the voices of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple houses of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IH virus.
The health of all Swaziland is reflected in the Miniature of Esitjan: the highest rate of HIV infection, the world ' s lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF data.
The circumcision of extreme flesh in men, who have proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the people in Swaziland carry an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon.
Horus opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogeni saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, there is no chance of a person in a poor country.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for several euros per year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voice for Africa Association, which has since been almost professionally responsible for AIDS orphans in Esitana.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamydiasis and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral IPPs.
Lobby pedicle and garlic are parasitic ICPs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are common among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute believes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual relations between men.
Heterosexual adults often have sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia infections, trihomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are in this group.
The incidence of chlamydia infections among young people is much higher than among other populations.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also often encounter human papilloma virus among young people.
How do the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to the Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, there may be ulcers in the field of genitals, complaints in the area of urea release, secretion, abdominal pain, and bubbles or entanglements.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
The condoms can reduce the risk of contamination but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
After all, partially sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of frequent switching of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, most STDs can be cured and remote effects avoided.
Headship, donations, and not least, fees for people speaking throughout Germany allow for something to be collected.
"We have all sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjan," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is directed by Tsodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well - arranged, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu old women call it, is the foot of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that children in their form would appear in class each day.
Those who have no family left are admitted to the shelter of Hannisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as are the two incidents that each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two smokers, and together with the US Health Organization PSI organized HIV analysis for many village residents.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to be deeply silent.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies on drifting workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support the cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir travels in southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sorrow, spirit of war, confidence and black consciousness that many in the southern part of the continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black language - this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened to cause tears in the eyes of heavy border guards.
The trip is always taking place in Esitjan, where singers visit children who are in charge.
Although a small village is hard to find on the map, it is more famous in the Eclaveni Valley.
"Go to Esitjan, there's light," people here say.
And after 8733 kilometers of flight back to Heidelberg, when the melting singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
NASA's opening ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that Mercury had ice on the planet.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA's space agency has proven that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also freezing water, as appears from the three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the shadowed region of the planet will be covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least three inches [30 cm] and possibly up to 20 meters [20 m].
Water is supposed to occur with comets or possibly asteroids that have collided with Mercury.
No one links the opening of ice to life on the planet, said scientific leader of the Sean Solomon probe.
Mercury temperatures can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life came to other locations in the solar system.
For Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: small specks to endless dairies.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who looks around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, for a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents the “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, the harder it is to identify pink “new-born” stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation -- scientists are unromantically calling it the W5 -- was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at the distance of 6,500 light-years.
This floating glow of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
It looks like a doughnut ring consists of a material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant Nebula Trifid, which is 5400 light-years away from the Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic maternity room.
A starary copy of the Playada, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, the color telescope is better.
As a red eye winks at the observer, the Nebula Nebula in this infrared photograph.
It is located 700 light-years in the constellation of Aquarius.
The alignment with the Earth's continent brought this nebula called North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides expressive color rendering.
This new star in beauty was only photographed using the Spitzer Infrared Telescope Sensors.
Saturn and its rings, as they emerged, one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It could be the fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared untraceablely four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble Telescope: the Waterworks Galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, the images of spiral galaxies are transformed into actual works of art.
The photos published by the European Southern Observatory show Trifid's several thousand light-years-distant constellation of the Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three - part, three - part), since the dark dust strips divide the cracked heart of the stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Bejenos, astronomers photographed a space collision forerunner: At 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of the two gliding galaxies run into each other and will inevitably collide.
It's the birth of the star that the Hubble telescope took off in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical reductions can call it the Southern Pipe Colosseum.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
A 1,400 light-year-old nebula consists of dust particles that range from ten to one hundred times less than normal household dust.
This image was made of optical and x-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed a Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starry nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
Star Trek keeps creating new stars.
It's a star cloud connected to Rosette's nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a little black hole, there's no dust, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the Universe.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem before Galileo started observing the stars a year later.
Ever since then, optical telescopes have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope in the Palomar Observatory of San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here was five meters in diameter.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a larger binocular telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Grand Telescope Canarias has a giant internal device, with a mirror diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Greater South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce its value.
Nevertheless, the diameter is approximately eleven metres.
Lack of low-cost design performance: The telescope is firmly anchored at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature is a high lighting capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to alien signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the "Search for the Alien Mind" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computing capacity.
Species for European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" here, which is perfectly consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the medium infrared spectrum to shine in a visible pipe.
A European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned in the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror shall be open to a total of 42 metres and shall be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
By 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two ten-metre diameter mirrors.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks at the sky with Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, Mauna Kea must have a new giant telescope with a 30-metre-diameter mirror.
They can enjoy illustrations here.
However, the most important species from outer space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been found since the start of the mission.
The photograph shows the latest preparation of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to outer space not earlier than 2018 aboard Ariane 5.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is that it has to look for the first stars and galaxies in the world to find the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest there's ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data on this, since the Messenger is moving closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the “Messenger” probe launched in 2004, the first that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident of it.
Drink oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age in the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
A search for a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age in the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
A search for a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
Traveling through the Talish Mountains is called wild and romantic.
There is a booming minibus on a curved road past densely forested hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant houses.
Everyone around here is so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
They live here, one of the people of the Caucasus who is known for little, except for what they say on the farce and the Azerbaijanis, and they are of longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town boasts an overly demanding architecture of Soviet times, which is completely out of harmony with a picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes 8 hours for 323 kilometers, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May Baku celebrated the Eurovision song festival, and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people," said Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen wafers of these places over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is Shirali Muslum, who was said to have reached 168 years of age.
No birth certificates, however.
And given that the older person whose age was confirmed by the documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslumov was extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, who were thought to have a daughter at the age of 136.
Did he thus add the chaban Musleum to his age for a few decades?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age at Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the debtors in Central Asia.
“A striking number of people of advanced age can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholtz, “there are also very many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, age scientific evidence is impossible because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of warm oil
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the Lerick area often reach Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many people here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Muhimzade explains this by special genes of the waist.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it is a matter of food.
However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a matter of prime life that keeps people young, in Chengemira, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, where Rubaba Mirzoev lives?
At the age of 97, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter running around.
Eight people live under the same roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaev, who have long had their grandchildren.
There's also two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests make tea, which is served in typical crawling glasses of Armood.
Mirzay's perfect white and strong white teeth, under her headcoat, hides long dark blond hair, which her son proudly exposes to us.
I've always had my hair milk, so they never fell out and preserved their color.
"And I never used shampoo," Mirzaev said.
A monthly pension is short of life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Gédar Aliev's "loving father" got up in the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult around the father of a nation that ruled as a dictator in Azerbaijan hardly knows the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, accepted the government’s bars.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) a month as a pension, for local conditions this is the sum for which you can live well.
And perhaps a long-grown son of Mirzay also said, "The ancients of our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, cared for, and happy.
The reason for not staying alive for as long as possible
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division of the country.
The future Sharia-based constitution met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president did not focus on the paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first of all to Christian hordes, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and unreligious Egyptians.
Indeed, they are all still hopelessly divided into scattered opposition.
Fear of a religious State in the Nile at the mercy of a powerful Brother Muslim.
Mohammed Mursey, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily cut down the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and extended his competence to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate at the American University of South California really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were managed in a nightly 15-hour jump with obstacles to the Islamic-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings are based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains the case for interpretation, and Islamists can be feared to use the vague language and the legal lute that it creates to further interpret sharia.
At least this is indicated by one new article: in all Shariah-related matters, the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution of the country, which enjoys great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are overseeing legislation, that de facto would result in restrictions on the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem is: the jurisdiction of civilians must be preserved to the military court.
These courts served to suppress the opposition during Mubarak's reign.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, there have been up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
It also states that the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values”.
Legally, it is not clear that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
An open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
However, the other forbids insulting and perjuring the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the wording that prohibits “insultation of people”.
Would it be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about justice?
The question of interpretation, like much in this project, which Mursey proposes to sign and which he said would “very soon” be presented to the Egyptians in a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square, Cairo, and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was a place “on the backdrop of history”.
Through the short news service, he accused Mursey's followers of wanting to lead the race against democracy.
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it," said oppositionist Yasser Said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,” Egyptian media quoted Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not wish to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Musulman Brothers, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of Neil to the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and fans of the Salafite who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursey to clean the country, and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has led to virtually civil war.
Mursey's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
“Muslim brothers” stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had made themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to give the people a solution to the electoral urn in which the country should go.
Most Islamists' project is considered to be a resolved case.
“The concept of human rights is not mentioned at all”
Hafiz Abu Saeda was furious at this forced constitutional process, which should have lasted until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EDR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or brought to trial in Mubarak.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights were indivisible for him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, he regrets talking to Welt am Sonntag.
Increasing the influence of Mursey on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to a lawyer.
These measures represent clear impacts on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the President de facto annulled it”, regrets Saeda.
After all, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
Payback may be made for that.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Rafiq: The world's dumbest fish?
For the five million people of Norway, one of the highest living standards is not only in Europe but also worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success has something to do with the local passion for one extremely vicious fish dish?
Take some of the overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to get the scenting scent of the Rafis, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagerness, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, it's going to smell an insurmountable characteristic smell.
Raqfisk is a pail, salty and wandering in the water up to a year, depending on what the mattress needs to be achieved.
As the Sumerians collided and cooled, the crowds of Norwegians gathered at the Fagernes festival on the same, say, fascinating dish.
“She is eaten raw and sung by a rummy waterbender, a local dark vodka,” explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter for the profession and a member of the “raffic general” who runs the festival.
All around us, people eat fish sliced with small cubes and drink it with large quantities of alcohol.
"Someone prefers aquavit than a raccoon," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's not much different from the amount of land you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, before refrigerators were introduced, fish were covered in hermetically closed salt water barrels in autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when fish were well and thoroughly engulfed, they were taken out and consumed with alcohol while suppressing their perception of alcohol.
As early as last generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly -- more than 13 per cent are immigrants, who are brought here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a longtime rival, not long ago and a much more prosperous neighbour) come to work here.
The Raffisk is seen as an important symbol, an irreplaceable, even if a somewhat vicious element of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, you will find it expensive — a small beer cup or a sandwich worth £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the population seems to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Braywick, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Not to mention his name, the terrorist is referred to as “the July 22nd”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s well-being today is based on the growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, carrying trays with long, long hair, and amazingly blue eyes, the embodiment of a frenzydical well-being.
We are such a people, as you call them, a people of understanding.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing off, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil industry's revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone had spent money that they had not had, Norway had carefully calculated all costs.
“As long as you can skate on winter skis and walk on summer trips, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a raccoon," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - the raccoon will be enough for me.
Here's a cheeseburger -- it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we have an even greater quantity of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
I have a special dinner at my hotel on the Rafiq, where visitors vote for the best or perhaps the most delicious fish.
It's a direct television set that shows the lead in a tie-grabber surrounded by a plate with a raccoon.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what estimate did you make for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our grade."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, maybe picking up an aquavit.
Or maybe just by the smell of that fish.
President Enrique Peña Nyeto of Mexico faces a challenging start in his career.
While Mexico's newly elected President, Enrique Pena Nyeto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The road traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly deplorable state.
The city was overloaded with transport at the best of times, and from Monday, steel fences were erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this has not been done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protestors from reaching the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nyeto, will put on the Presidential bandage and will take over the country.
He faces a challenge that is not easy.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now has its powers, but the country has been at war with drugs, which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to combat violence”, Mr. Penya Nyeto told the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, in the White House Oval Office earlier this week.
I intend to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, Mr. Peni Nyeto’s political career as governor of his native state of Mexico was developing.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state, the surrounding capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
Straight-lined man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Its inhabitants deserve the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the establishment of infrastructure.
You can reach the city by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pena Nyeto, which differs greatly from the roads with holes and pits that were previously there.
His name is on a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We link with him the hopes for real and serious changes,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Alvera Hernández, state congressman from the leading Pena Nyeto institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country needs so badly, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residence, the PR Party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Alvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nyeto.
He also refutes the accusations of insubordination, which the new president has made against the opposition.
He is very direct and very devoted to the embodiment of his vision of the future country.
He's a great public figure, and, above all, he's a good listener.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesawalkootl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Under the estacade of highways, it is in many ways the suburb of Mexico City itself.
The problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in the reconciliation of drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; violence against women is particularly acute here.
In the desert near a vast landfill only in the last two years, dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the Governorate, Mr. Peni Nyeto, which is far more than that in the sadly celebrated violence in the city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become defiant when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Peni Nyeto, it is best to say that during his tenure as governor, he was unable to deal with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this vast area, finds it difficult to hold back the tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was killed by her cohabitator.
"When I got to her house, it was as if her body had been washed before," recalls Mrs. Bouendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body had already healed.
Mariana's mother relates this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall where he hangs next to the crucifix on which one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they said was denied to the family.
"The state officials treated me like an old contraband, disgruntled violator of peace.
They want people to just accept what they are saying and to give up.
But it is wrong, it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and misreadings around," she says.
Nadev's presidential transfer on Saturday, President Penya Nyeto, along with her, will take on a difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have raised violence-related crimes, and the new President has pledged to make the problem a priority during his reign.
“I hope that he will be the same president as he was the governor,” says Olvera, Congressman of Valle de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, that is what the victims' families in Ciudad Nes are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning hasn't complained of ill-treatment, he's making a charge.
Prosecutors attempt to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning ' s presence in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires closing the case on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to a military prison.
During the cross-examination hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits to Manning's prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination in the defence motion for termination of Manning ' s case was conducted on the basis that the conditions of his detention were severe and were in themselves sufficient punishment the following day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filed after Manning's visits to the Administration during his stay at Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During their visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he viewed the treatment of the prison administration as “superior” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports considered do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about these issues and that the representatives of his administration had discussed these problems with him and stated that they would, but had not fixed them in writing.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that considered the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted him to remove the regime of “injury prevention” and mitigate the conditions of detention.
The representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited detention regime, below the suicide prevention surveillance regime, had been introduced to protect the prisoner as well as to protect others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that everything is fine with me so that they can reverse the trauma prevention regime... so that my level of life will improve, in my opinion,” explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of suicide had appeared to him in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness because of the intense heat of one day.
He explained that it was psychologically difficult for you not to know how your participation was going and what was going on in the outside world.
"My world has fallen to Camp Arifjan, the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours — and often more than 23 hours a day — alone.
Manning says he's only allowed to leave mattresses, blankets, hats, a few clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because sleep or even just lie down during the daytime banned the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck by a light that penetrated the outer chamber.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned into a bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to turn on his back.
Counsel Manning filed a formal objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he made during Thursday ' s testimony that after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners for the morning ' s inspection.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover himself with blankets during the inspection.
Responding to the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from a security order that he had to drop the blanket that he could hide, but admitted that no one specifically ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a puss or hat to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, his hats, and his glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will, at least, take into account what he had to survive during his detention and significantly reduce the duration of his detention if Manning is found guilty by a military court to begin his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it intended to offer Manning a plea for less serious crimes, while other charges were to be challenged as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution party is expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon alleges that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of persons arrested with the most stringent regime.
The charges against Manning included aid to the enemy, illegal promotion of Internet disclosure, the transmission of information relating to national defence and the abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all the points of the indictment, he may be in danger of life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of self-realization.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navaretta believes that Mexicans of American origin break up between two cultures.
During my recent visit to Mexico City, I went down the corridor for the arrivals, approached the border control zone, and found myself standing on the ground.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicans, the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I was standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later on, I focused on the complex design of the American of Mexican descent.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became an extraneros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nyeto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was a familiar meeting of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pena Nyeto was eager to speak about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which allowed Mexicans to now, with the same success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to establish a North American trade bloc similar to the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nyeto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old matter.
Most Americans have never thought of the United States' invasion of Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to abandon half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events all over.
It is therefore only worth talking to a U.S. official about criticism towards Mexico, the press and the elites of Mexican society that complains that Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with violence.
Mexico ' s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is the most complex.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent are just one reason: at some point in their family history, someone -- a father or a grandfather -- was unable to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- smoldering, under-educated, of poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our lives are the embodiment of an American dream, we've studied in good schools, and we've arranged for good work, but we can't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider.
United States of America.
We also know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not love us.
We answer to them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second class people like untouchable Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is a matter of failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a good life in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved legally to the United States when she was a child, and this reminds me that there are certain trainings between true Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and the Americans of Mexican descent are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Mexican Americans feel no part of them.
We're listening to the Mexican Los Tigres del Norte group, but we're also listening to Bruce Springstine.
When you get the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my visit, as if our relationship had not been sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals wanted to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican descent to work as ambassadors to Mexico and to represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
In view of the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not find this country so beautiful.
Excuse me, but handle this yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for the way they did Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still resented the recent treatment of their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for the future world
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed encourages the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
The usual, senseless disputes about who first started; many buildings were turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians; and six Israelis; for the first time in the Gaza conflict, missiles fell in the vicinity of Israel's capital Tel Aviva and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless link between the Israelis and the Palestinians in their perennial conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many persistent realities in the rebel storm, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the storm that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloodthirsty than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope that this deadly impasse will come to an end.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to optimism.
Even if the cease-fire signed on 21 November would be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the force forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim to have forced Israel to resign despite the losses they suffered.
Although some faction leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world has increased, Hamas has new, powerful and rich friends.
Turkey's resurgent regional leader, who once was Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, supported Hamas; it was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Gulf of Persia.
Hamas' trading supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist half-month around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, ruled by the Hezboll militia, to Syria, in which more and more Islamic rebels were about to overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities were threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Mursey has strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator with no special attention to Hamas support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas may become a major player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was cast.
The Israeli missile system, the Railway dome, has met the costs of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas's rockets.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully for at least a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States has remained faithful and many European countries have also blamed the start of the last round of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor was Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binyamina Netanyahu, which had largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis had been killed from rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel had managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall that entered the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protected Jewish settlements that continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Liqud, in preparation for the January 22nd elections, has been brought together with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of creating Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they had all the power in the West Bank, would they not start launching rockets into Israel, as their gatherings in the Gaza Strip do?
It is best to hold them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
The supporters of the “hard” line may win; however, their calculations may be refuted in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of Israel's budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of President Egypt, Murcy, who worked with Barak Obama to put an end to the fire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must take into account the long-term implications of its policies, to a minimum.
As democratic changes occur in Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians ' right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like a bus detonated in Tel Aviv this week.
Reprisals are already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of the Arab population is only aggravating these problems.
The massacres, which take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, have to be paid for by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution remains that is constantly called upon by healthy representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world, and our newspaper: the formation of two States and the assignment of Israeli territories in exchange for security.
The hope remains not too impressive in the short term, the hope that a ceasefire will make other countries more effective in influencing the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which has long since decided to halt arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, more than ever, a beneficial position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also had a role to play in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not submit his own peace settlement plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to join the problem.
It's a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
A unified cigarette package law has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings of the harm of smoking and images of body parts affected are contrasted with those of the dormant green boxes, which are the same for all cigarettes.
First in world practice, the Australian Law on Single Packing of Cigarettes and Tobacco Products came into force, replacing logos and coloring of various stamps with the same unyielding colour box, with horrifying images of the affected parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between packages, which is mandatory from this Saturday, is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking until the age of 26 were 99 out of 100 and never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to make through packing”, explains Health Minister Tanya Pliebersek, referring to studies that have shown, for example, that the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the smallest smokers in the world, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering taking such measures.
The tobacco industry was strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those of its origins,” said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale in Australia ' s streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that demand for portsigars and silicones hiding unpleasant packing pictures has grown rapidly since British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented some 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The popularity of social networks among the part of the population targeted by these measures is considered a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertisements for cigarettes and their support for sporting activities, as well as banning sellers from putting cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising has been moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertisements, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you have only this small well left, the idea of moving your product on the Internet will prove extremely tempting," explains Becky Freeman, a public health follow-up at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written by persons allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it true that the hand of a citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has no time and strength to make a video, or is the advertising company behind it worth it?
The Australian office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to the new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry even sought measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States were making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all those countries with Australia were very small.
WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of enacting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced a mandatory location of photographs to warn of the harm of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia, many smokers are not subject to innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haigh, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on his bag.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package complicated the placement of goods by regiment
“I used to have an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and ban cigarettes altogether, and we would have said, ‘What are we going to do, okay, we're done, we're closing the store?’” he said, pushing our hands up.
It's not that bad to miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
On this day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane found mechanical faults and replaced it with another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there are no books, no magazines, no iPhones, no duty-free shops.
However, more scientists and professionals on child development have recently expressed themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children, it is not so bad to miss.
This forces the brain to distract itself from interesting related subjects, which may contribute to creativity.
And since all of us in today's world are constantly facing some kind of screen, the advantages of being bored pass us by.
Perhaps we should strive for boredom?
Yeah.
At the same time, it's not.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times when people have more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions of boredom dating back to the first century were found.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of the University of York, Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom have often changed.
Having studied the research on this topic and asked the target group 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is “when people want but cannot do what they want.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a boring person doesn't do something he wants to do.
There's nothing you want to do when you're apathetic.
He said that the main thing was “the distortion of attention and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the sense that time was going on slowly”.
Describing boredom may appear to be very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who miss the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when we're really just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study “Unemployed Mind: The Definition of Distinction in Attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment, which participants listened to the recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of a non-community television programme included in the next room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that they could hardly be understood and the third group listened only to the voice recording without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard low - volume TV observed that they were bored, more often than not, had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus our attention on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention may be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Gulf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example by looking at the flow of goods on a conveyor in the search for marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people start hanging on a chair or drawing caracules on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that really these actions just help them not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not prohibited to fertilize and spin learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit calmly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored with the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “sufficient to boredom” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and assertions, such as “Many of what I have to do is uniformly and monotonous” or “I am too interested, so there is no time.”
Using such questionnaires, researchers identified boys as more likely to miss girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with a variety of external irritations.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was involved with a pager with nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and at home, and 23 per cent said they were bored out of school.
At the same time, only 3 per cent of parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no record of what such boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at the adolescent age, there is a tendency to be boredom” mainly because children and adolescents are not able to decide fully what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes it does not, because in extremes it is shown that research can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it is boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you're bored and you send that energy to play guitar or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to cope with boredom alone or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And these self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he argues.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, but he also learns to control himself at all.
I don't think there's any need for boredom.
But it's not bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be more bored with boredom -- it's a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from the constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constantly overstimulating the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose and we don't know what to do."
It is still unclear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a student of public college in the south-east of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: the possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one September he and his friends were in Lamara driving in a prairie car near the Kansas border when the police stopped them.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for the possession of drugs and for the possession of devices for drug use, minor offences for which a fine of $100 is due, and the date of the trial is set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks since the State of Colorado voted in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small trials depend not on the law but on the place where they are being considered.
The charges of small marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which took a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 years and over for keeping small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
However, in more conservative areas of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with the current marijuana cases and continue to be held accountable for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, they vote to prevent new, licensed marijuana shops from appearing in their places.
“It’s all going so fast that I don’t even know what to look forward to,” says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of control authorities in the state of Washington are also puzzled about their heads.
They have to establish rules to determine how to license the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example”, explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Board for the Regulation of Production and Marketing of Alcohol in the State of Washington.
But no one can do more now, Mr. Smith admits than make proposals and hope that this will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can focus on,” he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will place the state in uncertainty for a whole year when the State licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between a state order on “appropriate access” to a licensed marijuana banning trade at 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana companies in the city line, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established study group “The Centre for the Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Avora sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would no longer involve persons of the age of 21 with responsibility for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would cease to expose people to these violations “from this moment on”.
The Chief of Police, Outs, reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with the regulations governing marijuana growers for medical purposes and would pursue illegal traffickers and drug dealers.
The Weld District Attorney in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to be held accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage users to undergo treatment.
At present, 119 persons have been charged with holding two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many have been accused of other violations.
“The obligation of our institution to prosecute for acts which are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Bak in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa village district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Djankshn, the largest city in the county, is no longer responsible for the possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop the charges against the marijuana case already opened.
“I believe that to enforce the law until it changes, it is our direct duty,” he says.
While 55 per cent of the citizens of Colorado who participated in the vote supported the decision, the inclusion of marijuana in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different states has revealed the ambiguity of the local authorities ' attitude towards the marijuana state experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of marijuana convicts, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They've been chasing people for so long for this, they can't really live with the fact that it's no longer a crime,” he said.
Colorado and Washington, the first states in which a small number of marijuanas are treated as alcohol, are destined to become a pilot country-wide field to test the idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalizationists and state officials plan to expand the area of legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxious to receive instructions from the federal authorities that continue to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
It is hoped that the Office of Justice will turn to this issue.
Despite a few broad-based arrests of merchants and patients who used marijuana as medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases benefited from the marketing of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Drug Control Bureau are unlikely to enter the homes to confiscate a small pot of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-controlled recreational marijuana shops that are permitted under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabeth, former Drug Control Adviser in Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for action by the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have been opened sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western state, proposed a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in such a situation that we will license someone and then cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of outstanding issues to be resolved.
Petronell Wyatt: I got out of Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described him as the world’s best educational institution, a modern analog of an ancient symposium that lays the foundations of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks later, after studying at the University of Oxford University School of History, at the end of the 1980s, I collected my cocoons and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had left because I had to drink some of the starched cups.
It wasn't really that much fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
It's not because of my very unusual name or my private schooling.
I was grassed for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Tetcher, and I was a supporter of the conservatives myself.
You're gonna ask, why do you think of that now?
According to the latest figures, a new generation of students with right-wing views are subjected to the same grass.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred for Oxford conservatory students is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators at Christie's College College College in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, personally assaulted and made to feel unwanted” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on “The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right” policies in which conservatives were presented by eccentricists and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservatory Association, who rides in the Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver stick.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make “goats of leave for higher school fees”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the Nottingham University Conservatory Association, said in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers that "in the university environment, there is an increase in the distortion of the left views.
People who don't even know us, they think we're the most violent and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the University of Oxford College of History, in which a request for strengthened protection was made, calls such an atmosphere “inconceivable”, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, a new president of the Oxford University Conservatory Association, says that the attitude of the student club towards the right-centred attitudes has worsened considerably.
“This constitutes a threat to both the intellectual debate and the normal life of the club members,” she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a slave and a shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford fever from hate to conservative party.
One year earlier, Margaret Tetcher, a former student, had voted in favour of the university because of a reduction in budgetary allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be inconsequential.
In the early days of the year, when the students met each other and the teachers, for the first time, I felt that I was ahead.
I had not yet known that teachers not only looked at the grass of conservator students, but they were happy to participate.
Political issues - mine strike, privatization and opposition by the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in South Africa - have penetrated through the wooden panels of the audience.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very eager man with a cake-like face.
"The teachers don't learn French in principle, or do they just miss their brains?" he asked.
Other students sneered.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few basic French lessons in your free time, if you are not very busy turning around in society,” said Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch, and then someone grabbed my shoulder.
It was James, a second-grader from the Faculty of English who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatory Association.
'I know who you are,' he said cordially.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll find it more difficult.
Most conservative high school students pretend to be Labourers."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to impersonate.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who had studied in Ethan, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students caught up with him.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" One of them asked.
- They're rolling each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt homosexual before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I just going to have to meet up with all-thinkers under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed to me to be hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
Norman Stone, professor of modern history, was the only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views.
He was hated not only for being part of the conservatives but also for being an adviser to Thetcher on foreign policy and one of her co-conspirators.
He almost didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his provinciality, frailty and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies, during his fortieth years, he had adopted all political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- There's no way they can do that, except in a city with no sleeping pins...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His wet eyes are blurry.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was tired of going to London, and my emotional protection was weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, was under pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week during the seminar, when another history teacher called me “enemy of the people” very seriously, I decided to do the same.
In a soul burned by shame, I admitted that "I've been brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old fools."
It's been a while.
The last nail in the cover of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a platter and a clap.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in a school.
The saddest thing was that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen prime ministers of thorium, but still conceals itself from the undeserved reputation of the university in which equality and freedom of thought are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
About Valentino, the sewing master, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of accepting the exhibition about Valentino Guarana.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentino: a sewing machine, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that has brought together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, whose only character is "or synorad" Garavani, but it could not be written without its named clients.
Valentino has always felt the charm of a rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened before 3 March, personal letters and photographs of the most prominent aristocrats, from the Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain, will be abundant.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social recovery: from the modest port from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the godfather of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
"They don't even put out their cigarettes about your magnificent envelope, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unsimilar host, and he accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his scarf in Gstaad," explains Hyney Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Evgenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of fame.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Macha, representing Valentino
The Argentine model of Valeria Macha remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to his house for dinner, after showing fashion in the square of Spain in Rome many years ago.
Among the 20 visitors were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style appeared in everything -- in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, in music.
“Every guest in Valentino felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the model began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never gets out of style because his sketches are actual works of art," she ends.
Synchronising folder
Garavanna's life is not a story of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was transformed into a glamorous podium of 60 metres long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes a model place and has to defilate on the podium, the gazelles of the “rears” from the wells that glisten masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti used in the Night, or the coat of hair and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Dib.
This publication features names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino, as the first love, is "impossible to forget."
I remember him well.
These were pants, shirts, razor blades, and a spring-winter jacket 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Ferria.
I love the colors he uses: they have lots of light and they "appear" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Patricia Della Joampaola's law enforcementwoman, D'Arenberg, can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a celebration at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a coat of collars, a corsage in a fold and a cut without a toddler.
"It was a dream that appeared," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary," explains the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the modeler with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories accompanying him."
Fashion "King"
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Paulus from Greece in 1995.
It took four months to work and 25 girls (as the modeler calls their own stitches) to make this piece of ivory shell with a pearl inlaid, twelve different circles and a helmet four and a half metres away.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in the late 20th century, “returning clients from the highest world”.
A long-deprived “life style” of elites, Valentino is now her best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalry (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavallor, the Commandor of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavana gathered as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"Always my attention has attracted his subtlety, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," Dr. Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a solemn dinner at the Museum of Orsa.
He was sitting at a table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners with Kawah-Ijena
For four Euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by pushing 70 kilograms of sulphur into the top of the volcano on steep rocky dunes
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living for the production of sulphur in Kawah-Ijgen volcano, located in the east of Java, Indonesia.
Each day, Antoine descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas rising from the depths of the earth stops in contact with the air.
The sheath of huge pieces of sulphur, which can weigh 70 kg, is placed in two bamboo baskets, and the baskets on its shoulders, carrying them up a rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is only 250 metres high, it takes more than 40 minutes for the truckers to rise at a turtle’s pace, with difficulty of keeping their balance and carefully squeezing the road so that they do not retreat and fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed several years ago from Kawah-Ijena.
The Kawah-Ijena Shakhir earn 5 Eurocents per kilogram of sulphur that they earn
When they are up there, they pave the way between tourists who take photographs of them, as if they were monkeys from the circus, carrying heavy baskets, walking three kilometres to the weights that the mining company placed slightly higher, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is PT Kandi Ngrimby, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of petroleum products, since this mineral is distributed in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even bleach sugar.
"As the standard is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a disgrace to such an inhuman effort, it is three more things that he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high according to local measures, where the price for coffee is 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day and the average monthly wage is equal to two million rupees (167 euros), " explains the trucker, who had previously worked as a stoneman on the Bali tourist island.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is just as devastating as the sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus brought her to Java to receive Islam."
Anto's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of toxic gas.
At his 27th birthday, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah-Ijen, whose sera had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
That's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I will work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French”, he promises in more than acceptable English.
The life-punished young man could be a tourist guide, waiter, or porter at the hotel, but instead he does the mullah work.
For a dirty wooden hut with other stretchers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the cheese does not stop leaking at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Throwing a shadow call, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 stretchers carry gray baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur for cost savings and provide no equipment to carriers working on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (€2.5) for a photo shoot, which, along with a 15,000 rupees (€1.2) ticket, guards charge tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its mule people.
"This is a work for cattle, not for humans," says Badrusin, a native carrier of 42 years, who spent three decades in Kawah-Ijena since he left college.
He's capable of raising up to 110 kilograms, and he believes he'll be able to endure as much as he can because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sera burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense pillars of the smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so self-inflicted that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthritis, knee pain, and ulcers on the shoulders that have deteriorated under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unajnik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow path among the plants.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unajnik, wide-opening mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a carrier of cheese.
The time passes, but poverty endures from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mules do with Kawah-Ijin.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singapore blamed careers, stress and housing and education costs in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot wife, we're gonna do our civic duty and we're gonna make a living!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of paint glues, but despite this - or possibly because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of a tail that uses local proverbs like “Let's put bao in the oven” to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in an entertaining way through advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to carry out their “national duty”.
This thing is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this is the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had tried to do a lot, such as launching spirits with pheromones or organizing fast dating parties (bleasts).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, make a tail?
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn't take it so lightly is the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage more children to be born.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for a child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was under 2 was known as a replacement rate in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Marriage and Family Policy Office of the National Population Office, says that the reason for this “improved education” and “the broader range of career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities other than marriage and family creation”, she explained.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
However, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration in order to counter the decline of the population, are indignant among the local population.
Singapore has websites with barely hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and unwilling to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the ruling Singapore party received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation ' s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditure and immigration policy, Singapore ' s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build such small housing.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved to the control of the number of small apartments known as the “covet box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square metres of apartments are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is the view that they can contribute to a comfortable lifestyle and prevent the incentives of builders who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yoo Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their box is sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that these apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than bigger apartments.
As a result, our monetary income is increasing.
Nevertheless, it recognizes that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for builders, to whom they used to put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have any special effect.
“People are very tense, expensive housing, as well as education, and that is why many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons for preventing them from bringing children.
So no matter how much the Government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to children, the last word remains with Singaporens as it relates to childbearing.
Personal in offline - personal on-line
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is the property of private or “the sphere of personal life which is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers faced when discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not have shared outside the Internet?
ElPerodoico interviewed five people between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with something very mine, in a personal plane, and with a password and the name of the user, when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't put my biggest secrets in a position," says ten-year-old Jorge when he's trying to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he argues.
On the FB, I download beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also amuse myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish inappropriate pictures of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures me he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
She knows she has a password to one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends in a hurry," he says.
Without thinking about it, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't count on anyone recommending him to a stranger.
José is 14 years old.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and last but not least admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my record," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy's no stranger's experience is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos of people who know him in uncomfortable or confused situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher in England and a teacher in education and training, believes that to send children and adolescents, we need to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but the rules of the game have changed as these sites appear,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Pransky, master of teaching at Yale University and the author of work The Digital Aborigines and Immigrants invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
Explains that the subject is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what they can or cannot distribute, publish or speak, when they are old enough to do so.”
“Also that they are selective, while most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences”, she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do so is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like to be published in a photograph of you, like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photographs from a party, do you ask other people for permission to recognize them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act on-line the same way they do it off-line.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and should also be on social networks”, she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and a consultant on education, explains the need for family heads to read social networks in good faith.
Knowing each point, they have good reason to talk to their children about the prerequisites for opening a record on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,” he said.
According to Gourdiya, the key question is to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ends without publication of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of the South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, previously and theoretically signed by seven binding parties.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Office of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
On the question of the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by President Peru, Olianta Umal, during brief press statements.
Journalists ' access to information on the Summit was limited all the time.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the Presidential Assembly without sound with the message “closed meeting, sound is prohibited”.
Few of the information circulated to reporters was provided by the press secretaries of some of the Governments of UNASUR, who attended the meeting, but not in Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, President Peru ' s administration sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umala ' s statement, not the official document to which the summit had ended.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and this time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not distributed.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made sure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict from the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinnier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the International Court of Justice ruling, which began in The Hague on Monday to hear statements by both parties, as part of the charges that Lima brought against Santiago.
“We will observe and execute a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court,” said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals,” Piñera added, and welcomed the handshake of the two countries in the background of their flag.
The confirmation by both presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested the Bogotá Pact this week, under which it recognized that the verdicts of this international court were subject to the ruling on the maritime borders of Nicaragua, which it found to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011, after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
President-in-Office, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in the Lima Times.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for the South American countries, with an estimated investment amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we extended the agreements on residence”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “co-operation against the insecurity of citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, affordable access to the Internet in all corners of South America and take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe in the crisis, “an economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis but should serve to expand our productive base and to anticipate a better future for our cities”, he added.
“We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that would improve the link between South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by bringing our countries together and creating new economic schemes”, said the Peruvian President in the communication.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a great deal of communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbours was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, President Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico City on Saturday to hold talks in a respectful form on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"After-hours (Sabbatical) maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan Pact, which will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will have a presence in the office of the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nyeto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc ' s defence ministers met in advance for the adoption of the Plan of Action for 2013, aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the issue of citizenship integration”: Rafael Correa
President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, should learn from Europe”.
Correa, who attended the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru that Europeans “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one motherhood”.
It protected, in this context, the South American nationality project, which is endorsed by UNASUR countries.
“There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but so far there are reactional sectors that want to bring us back to the past”, he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also advocated the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never make any commitments, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States”, he stated, indicting the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in due course “there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be respected”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring its territory to enter for questioning concerning alleged sexual crime, while “only Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of Assang’s physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What really exists is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to incarceration in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem provided by Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of security that would enable him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the British, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that negotiations in London to find a solution to the obstruction of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights; we do not use that word here, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of processes in various European institutions”, he said.
And he felt that “if Britain provides a guarantee of security tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him on Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that it did not tolerate “intermediation, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither the journalists nor the bankers nor the bourgeois Hegemone countries dominated Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, “encourage the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Korea also supported the decision to keep the Paraguayan veto at UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the mask of legality” because in fact “it has destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy”.
In addition, Ecuadorian President considered that his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos would now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
The decision has not been respected so far.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to work together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the maritime border dispute that was being held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if two countries undertake to decide however difficult it may be”.
With regard to the opportunity to speak as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador in order to run for the third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult”.
Correa assured that if she lost the February 2013 elections, she would be out of public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be remedied by political authorities.
“My political movement felt that I had guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept this responsibility”, he said.
If we won, it would be my last term as president, and then we'd be out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment that had already been planned, routinely, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean an increase in President Chávez’s health,” he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State participated in the Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (UNASUR) today in Lima at VI, which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Mortality From AIDS Today — The Result of Late Diagnostics
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his analysis of AIDS had a positive effect.
"I've been appalled," he remembers the difficult one, despite all the doctor's tactics, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much as possible, and his efforts were justified, and he had already noted his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "older" HIV patients of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he came from in 1994, overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would be difficult to believe that there were too few treatment options, too few knowledge of the disease, too prejudiced towards the sick.
So, even the director of the Mexican Social Protection Institute didn't want to say good-bye because he had a cut.
In other words, it was a sentence to have AIDS at the time.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, although not aware of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, has “sustained” their immune system and are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greater achievement is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”,” said HCG head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to this information being confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS infectionist and expert Andrada Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depend on the level of damage to the immune system available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years of reporting of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at 25 years of age will, according to these terms, “supporting control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Halisco in 2011, and 187 deaths were already recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still flying outcomes?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are at our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a lack of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, i.e. in the late stages of the disease.
He cited the breaking data: “Nine out of ten patients come in when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality rate is to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale for all people who request it.”
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA) and patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who applied for a private laboratory, were motivated only by what a friend did and despite his youth, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Sarcoma Kaposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'll get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of myself and another person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to promote his statement to those who are now in the context of World AIDS Day, is afraid.
Let it be checked that if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they were HIV positive, so much better, and if they already had a diagnosis, let them know that they could live as any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Preservation condoms
The great gap between health-care programmes and the ordinary citizen is believed by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has addressed the HIV problem.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the areas devoted to this task, “the distribution of condoms has actually increased before we were given one or two, now they give us packages per hundred, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to the condom”, he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" It's a popular question, with elegance and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, drug workers and health workers who don't want to hear from adolescents, who's a propagandist.
I propose that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms not only be behind the counters and that a hundred of them be found in vending machines in public toilets in places often attended by young people.
This is not an encouragement to promiscuity.
It was not about paying for beer and motel, Governor Emilio González replied when he was asked if a condom could be distributed under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity”, he noted.
Key data in Khalisko
13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been reported.
The state is ranked 4th in the national rating of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are sexual, 6 per cent blood and 2 per cent perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know it.
In view of the United States Court of Appeal ' s ratification of the decision, which cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a year-old precedent for any national subsidiary in a neighbouring country with capacity problems.
The procedures for supporting the survival of firms permitted by Mexican law do not appear to be valid in the country of strips and stars, in contravention of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves defenseless Mexican firms in front of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of the Rio Grand.
However, the ruling opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, giving evidence of three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge notes that creditors must be governed by the US Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern competition proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law has been established, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production held by the mother company of the Vitro branch, the majority necessary for approval of restructuring would not be reached.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first to adopt the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Production.
It is also true that the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, namely, the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergenceia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority by subtracting the votes of subsidiaries.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has experienced, with the impact of the country.
So far, the González Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote will reach its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require revision by the Supreme Court of the United States in this case.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“other court”), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it was exempt from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established in cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board Carabol: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
Taking into account the months-long complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the union association of aircraft pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
The authority led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the oversight body has systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be devoted to the purchase of shares by the Professional Manager of hotel companies.
As you know, Askarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel network Posadas.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Gathering at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to confront the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant selling and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously been able to bring together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which compared part of the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
Regarding the Government's rejection of the Senate's request to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the abbreviation for the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already gone to archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out, despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of considering it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term

Hector Hetin Reyes, basketball was my life.
Hetin Reyes, a rowdy basketball traveler, had been involved in this sport for over 60 years and, thanks to him, had travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before he was forced to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-scale player, a high-level basketball league player, an authorized and BSN leader with the Cowboys of Baymon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
“I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN, the Director General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, beginning in the mid-fifties as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a so-agent or agent of the contract.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's debut in BSN.
From then on, Kuko Ortis, who was the great administrator, continued to lead, said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was on his way to Alabama University, Birmingham, saying to me, "I have a very strong game for you, 6'7".
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed it with Gauss by the Cowboys, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy Minsi's achievements and achievements in the national assembly.
I remember the first time we won the United States during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, and that was to be the bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Cup team is the best assembly you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the United States, which was quite similar to the bronze we won at the World Cup.
Not only were Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortisa) played again, but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francesco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 years due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Canito Nyeves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily removed for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
Its performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that's not taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmaus, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arilla's work very much.
What do you consider your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the 1988-1995 National Assembly and that BSN had up to 17 teams in the early 1990s.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to do, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys should play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandkids and go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Ichabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman's actor died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous because of his primary role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas Teleserial, where he embodyed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing's oil predator at Dallas Teleserial, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died on Friday night because of complications caused by cancer, according to the family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, playing again the sign role he liked most," his family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him at the Dallas Fair on Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in Siquale, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was the original person and lived a full life," Grey confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was undergoing a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of a decent type in the light comedy of the "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive girl Jeanne played by Barbara Eden and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work at the cinema included roles well accepted by critics, "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colours".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the abominable J.R. that led Hagman to the peak of fame.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing Clan and other characters in its surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement slogan “Who Shot J.R.?” designed to create noise around an episode, full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, gave birth to international debates and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers' offices.
It also helped attract a record audience at the time.
When the response was given in November 1980, an average of 41 million telegraphers looked at it and turned Dallas into a second-round entertainment program in history, following the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was a cousin of J.R., Christine, who shot at Mary Crosby.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that she would be charged with prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and a unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be put to treatment.
"I know what must be on J.R.'s grave plate," Hagman said in 1988.
It has to be said, "This is where the honest citizen J.R. Ewing is staying."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the heroine of the original show, remembered Hagman's Friday as someone "great both in and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are happy to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed, and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actresses and singers Mary Martin, who glistened in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He attempted happiness on the theater stage of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything in there that would seem capable of hurting anyone or influencing them in any way," said Prensa Associada at the time.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients with fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and then,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a little while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is under way to investigate the End of Light.
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when Stuart Sharma, a professor of religion, decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unrestrained bait: the end of the Mayan “long reverse” calendar, 21 December, for which many people were caught as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharmé had no idea what he expected in the coming few months: Hurricane Sandy, a catastrophic financial crisis that some call "long-armageddon", and the growing conflict that Israel is in, a place where Christian theorists at the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharma told the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world at present, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, it's bad for those who have apocalyptic thoughts.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Professor Barry Wacker reads the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We are analysing why these ideas are spreading over time”, he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios suggest certain human actions.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I tried to tell the students that it was probably possible and impossible," said Wacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called the End of the World.
"We do not add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the light does not end," said Restall.
Despite the “immediate destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in the canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night in which the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
“The cities ended in two hours,” said Restall about his course for students with a high average score, which enrolled 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were any other places.
Students in turn assure us that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or absence.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and sisterhood, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But not one of the students interviewed -- let alone a professor -- said he believed in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project affected Maya's prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of the Temple of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he pointed out that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries of people reacting to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Most important in the English - speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of a course on the end of the world there.
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world”, he wrote, implying an order of higher authority.
We have the Pope's pardon.
He noted that many days of the last court had been mentioned for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately begin to think about the next date” or to philosophy that on 21 December it was the beginning of a seven-year period during which the world would end.
Students and teachers are committed to this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call someone from my friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
