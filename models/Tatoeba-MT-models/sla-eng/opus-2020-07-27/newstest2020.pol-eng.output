Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
To the Masses of liberation and healing which he performed, the crowds are being brought down.
He was just a few years old when things in his life began to be inexplicable.
Today, through the Frenchcanine, others experience it.
To be done by an o. Witek mshes of liberation and healing take the crowds away
The parents of a seven-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart came to him.
It was supposed to be operated.
Joseph Witko's father prayed over him.
That same day the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprising doctors said: “The operation is not needed, the accommodation is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents cried out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The Creator’s spiritual extraordinary activities began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, clean souls came to him asking for help.
I was awake at night and eager to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment – he mentions.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
"My body began to change.
I lost my human qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"Drown in the waters of a river symbolizing the baptism of the Holy, I was released and returned to the human form...", he says.
He didn't tell anyone about those strange experiences.
He grew up to be called.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In his sermons, he was not merely trying to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
In the Masses for the Recovery of Father Witko is attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.
However, the spiritual one stresses that spiritual and not physical healing is their primary objective.
The first failure of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team of the FrAC Kolping earned the credit to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogorija Gródisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superligi Tennis Table.
The celebrations in such a personal set that they presented with the citizens have no chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
This match with Darth Bogoria showed a great deal.
The team still lacks Chen Jingqi as team leader.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the celebration they would reach third from the order of triumph in the new season.
Young Asiata Qiyao Han does not seem to have come to win with a dozen such as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most promising Poles, or Mark Badowski.
Hellady was the biggest star of the match at the MOSIR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jaroslav.
Both in the old with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for themselves.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC ran 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak won the exciting, five-hundredth fight – Paul Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionys didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han didn't meet Badowski.
There won't be any additional research for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcements, a free prevention programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and its subsidiary Agency for Medical Technology and Tarification.
In its explanatory statement, the Agency explained that the target group had been badly selected.
"The above measures may even affect the detection of individual disease agents, which may contribute to increasing the difficulty of accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of the studies", it was written.
The decision of the department doesn't make sense to the president of the capital.
"The money's ours, we've anticipated it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will then go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is about to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps to quickly detect diseases and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that advanced experts say: ‘Let’s not study, because longer queues will be at the doctor’s, and if such experts advise the government, I’m not surprised that there’s a health service in this state,’ added the PO policy.
Palestine answers to Israel: We will break all agreements so far
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly session that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the Palestinian countries occupied.
"If the future government of Israel, which will arise, comes to fruition of this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," he threatened with pressure from Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means – little of the consequences – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the premier prime minister of Israel, again received a government-forming mission after the 17 September elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that the United States had sponsored.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised a popular election on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly session.
The latter took place in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I will call on the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended, in his speech, Palestinian rights, as a permanent observer in the United Nations, the use of the powers of the "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations".
Ambassador Danny Danon of Israel responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “will want to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomoussia under its leadership”.
However, Danon, as agencies report, did not refer to Netanyahu’s alleged annexation of Palestinian land.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the Newical Points of Industry
The story from the border crossing shows that the automatic defibrillator AED can save human life.
The Provincial Emergency Response Station in Industrial Industries wants such devices to be located in the city's newralgic points.
For their position, the officers received congratulations from the Provincial Emergency Response Station in Industrial.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojciecik are officials of the Podkarpacky Customs Office of Treasury in Industrial.
On 28 August, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. The Customs and Treasury officer noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian area.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, called the Communist Party Secretary from her family village on September 23 to announce that the husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death, he didn't reveal.
The Cao morgue saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says the woman.
"They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted on signing a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a “unfortunate accident”.
105 million PLN for video games companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost 105 million PLN of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry that create innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN.
Among the almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR, among other things, the development of a platform for the development of field games based on the AR engine, which creates a real world map, together with an application for data transmission by users; a test and training platform for testing practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game for the management of real manufacturing processes using the innovative virtual world model based on the real world interaction with the real world using the 4.0 industry concept – is presented in the communication to the NCBR on Friday PAP.
The goal of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
"The GameINN research agenda, which is already 300 million zł of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme, is an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential that we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R & D reliefs, skills development programmes, IP boxing or NCBR support programmes, drive innovative companies and enable them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market”, says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the science department points out that innovation money not only reaches innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from R & D relief than in the year before 2018.
‘The amount of the cost deducted for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, resulting in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN," the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded a total of over PLN 211.2 million in two previous grants.
The great interest of the III competitions and the diversity of the proposals presented show that the video industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly encouraging that projects selected – as in previous editions – include projects on solutions for not only entertainment, but also industry 4.0," he adds.
In the 3rd GameINN competition, even 20 million PLN could compete with entrepreneurs, consortium of entrepreneurs and consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBs received 87 requests for a total amount of funding of around PLN 317 million.
The competition budget was PLN 100 million at the time the competition was announced, but it was increased, giving 27 projects almost PLN 105 million.
Detailed information on GameINN results is available on Ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of Polish Games Associated Entrepreneurs, which includes, among other things, CD companies such as Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event took place on September 16th.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajaksu Amsterdam in Nice at the end of August, learned after training that his watch had disappeared from his locker.
Not at all, because it's worth $70,000.
An angry Danish man did not show up at class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the theft of Diaby-Fadig.
The 18-year-old already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to pay the Dane back the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to debut on the first team three years later.
This season he played seven games.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported in the newspaper “L'Equipe” – the club will probably solve it immediately.
So far, he's initiated disciplinary proceedings against his contestant.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands properly
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us wash them a little bit!
Just warm water and regular soap – it does not have to be antibacterial (a lot of doctors even advise them).
We wash not only the bottom and the top of the hands, but also: fingertips (set or single) – rub them with collapsible movements with the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (swimming your hands, rubbing your fingers against you), thumbs – each thumb covers the other hand and in such a embrace we turn it momentarily to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (in roads, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or door with your hands washed (the recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
President of Iran says he rejected the offer of talks with the United States, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not speak to the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US's offer to lift sanctions, said Iran's President Hassan Rowhani on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that it was an Iranian party that asked for the lifting of restrictions, which he disagreed with.
According to President Hassan Rowhani of Iran, the Americans have proposed the lifting of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The president of Iran said he did not agree to these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere”.
He said that he had met with American diplomats because he was forced by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not have talks in the atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and to the European parties to the nuclear agreement he accused of favouring US sanctions in Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US came out of the nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.
If we can overcome this precondition and if America can withstand sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with President Donald Trump of the United States, although he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian party.
"Iran wanted me to put up with the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" was tweeted by the President of the United States.
Voltage with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 Iran agreement with which they were signatories.
It stated that, in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is using the maximal pressure strategy for Iran, and the sanctions include a complete embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations every 60 days as a result of the agreement.

The judge of the Military Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the emissary Emilia, who, according to her words and screenplays from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking against the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the NSA.
Reason: Disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no basis for supporting WSA President Wojciech Mazur's decision to remove him from duty.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, an NSA disciplinary spokesman, initiated an investigation into Smydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into an action against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must address the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicion of participating in the heterogeneous group, has been removed from the KRS office, will come back to the hearing and will issue judgments on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Schmidt denies his participation in the Heat Group.
He says there's no evidence of that except for the fake screen and the words of his wife he's divorcing from.
The same is true of the other judges associated with “Cast”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll put it on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't shake her finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, and she's also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she kept on the phone in June on another matter.
The police did not shake their finger to secure the equipment of those whom Judge Waldemar Zurek had indicated in his February report.
There is no evidence – no Smydt case, no "Casty" case.
There is also no case of the chief of NIK Mariana Banas for renting a rock to pimps and hiding incomes.
CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check it out when he checks it out.
The Commission of Ethics will not deal with Banasi because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has gathered to make a curious decision to withdraw Banasians and appoint his lawyer, although the law of such an extraordinary combination does not provide).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel about how my wife comes home and gets married to a lover in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated she can't baptize a word.
She's standing at the door fainting, and in that time the lover is jumping out of bed quickly, dressing up and leaving.
And the husband is in bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams, "What is this?"
Who is this woman?
My husband says, "What woman, honey?"
Only it's about "Casty" or "Banasia" and it's about the state parody.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Litivenko in the final jump rise
Early in this season to compete after the break of the mother's competition, the bronze medalist of the world championships from London 2017, in the first try defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 only managed to get it in the third approach.
“I’m glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically," she admitted in front of the camera of the Eurosport Litivenko.
The elimination was best performed by American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karin Demidik – after 1.94.
Both of the contestants were the only ones who didn't break any heights.
The jump final was scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in serious condition
He went to the hospital, and his doctors call his condition difficult.
He's conscious and conscious.
"We believe that this will result in another win.
We all pray that he will return to health," Cornell Morawiecki, an anonymous close person, said in a conversation with the “Super Express” journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"My life is kept by my closest family and politics," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave two weeks ago to "Super Express" journalists.
In January, "Super Express" reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I experienced strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had a pancreatic tumor...", the Prime Minister's father passed on.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki went through a serious operation in the MSWA hospital in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal priest Zbigniew Crassa to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
"I know that many people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have a lot of metastases.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I'm handing in to doctors of specialists who are rather good thinking.
For the time being, after this major operation, I have to get back to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be all right," Cornel Morawiecki pointed out in January in a conversation with “SE”.
"If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said good-bye to the fall...", he added.
Cracow: 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Department in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nell Stoklossa.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is asked to contact us.
She left her residence on September 26th and did not return or contact her loved ones until now.
She was last seen at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nell Stoklasa is 14 years old, is 6'4", has blonde hair and grey eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants, and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact police No. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the lead jumps.
The title of the relations with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandra Street in Olav, may be for some deceivers.
To true power the path is far, but that is the name of one of the horse competitions...
The race of the powers of jumps consists of defeating the rider and horse of ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding that the world record, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse “Huaso”, is 247 cm long and still undefeated.
So high in Olav, of course no one has jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm does not belong to the worst...
The professions organized by Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the saddle” were a demonstration of the “Walking Championships” that we are writing more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazons trained for riding in the JKS of Olav.
Four of them competed on dogs, and four of them competed on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szöldra appeared best, sitting on the crazy “Sprinter”.
This small but dynamic rum began with overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a top white, 125 cm away from the ground.
However, it was not easy to give up and only after three subsequent refusals was removed from the competition by the jury from further competition.
The second place in the pony jumps was Amelia Pawlak, sitting "Famas", and the third was Lena Borun on "Harmider".
Ambitously, she fought the youngest contestant - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare “Carmen”.
Even more emotions accompanied the starters of the Amazons and the viewers during the big horse competition.
The menacing collapses included Pauline Szewczyk, who was sitting on the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was going to the “Boat”.
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with the minor beatings, the Amazons, and the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Many problems with the introduction of the young “Vineta” mare on the parking lot were caused by Veronika Łuczkiewicz.
It took either an assistant trainer or another horse for a couple that got a little crazy "Wineta" behind it.
After counting the obstacles from the parking lot, she also went down full-blown, so the moments in the boxing and the start-up room were getting dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little of these frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.
Since the start of the big horses competition, Marta Masalska has been doing great in the parking lot, sitting in a beautiful presentation of "Whishy".
This decent mare, with an experienced Amazon, took the second approach in the final phase as the first to jump 135 cm and that was the best result of the competition at this point.
However, the same height was added by Paulina Szewczyk to the “Declaration”, Veronika Łuczkiewicz to “Vincie” and Anastasia Abramenko to “The Lotca”.
To decorate the Flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all the contestants left together, and in the end, together with the amazon on the ponies in the beat of the Radecki march, they completed an effective round of honors, ending these interesting and emotional competitions.
Thank you.
The Riding Sports Club “In Siodle” warmly thanks the sponsors of the jump power contest during the 16th "Fighting Riders": to the City Office in Olav, the Waterworks and Canalisation Foundation in Olova, the County Age and the company ‘Mustang’.
Max Kolonko secludes from the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mary Max Kolonka was to go to October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young right-wing voters.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko failed to collect enough signatures to produce letters in any election district in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has completed his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect the W/WWW to delete my name from my name.
He would kindly ask for my person not to be involved with the entity in question," he added, and announced that more information would soon be given.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work, whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4th, on American Independence Day, a US journalist, Mariusz Max Kolonko, informed of the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has heard about running Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and in the world.
"We've had enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonka said.
Among other things, the party's agenda included issues relating to judicial matters (should be chosen in general elections), tax changes (comparation of the amount free of tax for all), military reparations (in the form of military assistance for the NATO Eastern States, with particular reference to Poland), a referendum on the possession of weapons, a reduction in the number of Members or the introduction of one-off constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mary Max Kolonko joined with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that #R would combine forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally occurred.
UBS: Gold near the balance point
"The euro exchange rate will be maintained in the coming months around the 4.35 PLN ceiling, which will be accompanied by a weak global market situation," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"Expectations for maintaining a strong economic growth and a stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising the gold quotations at the current ceiling," the expert said in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise its rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks ease policy.
"As long as the gold is properly valued – euro quotations should be maintained in the coming months in the vicinity of the 4.35 PLN ceiling – so little attractive according to him Polish bonds are.
Much more favourable profitability than Polish paper offers bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocations to emerging markets in UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's economic situation.
"The global slowdown may be further down, but there should not be a severe recession, and as far as GDP is concerned, slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
‘Investors should disregard global actions that may be detrimental to the lack of prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump and Brixite impeachment procedure.
Europe should be the weakest among the stock markets", according to the latest letter by UBS head of Wealth Management Mark Haefel.
"Actions from euro area countries should behave worse than the US countries because they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowing down", we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, even up to 0.74% of the German ten-year-olds' earnings are still likely to increase in the fall in profitability after the most secure countries' bond markets have pushed the German 10-year-olds to a minus 0.74%.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only in the short term, with a view to easing bank monetary policy.
The biggest field to reduce feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the horizon for years to come.
The long-term balance point for euro notes is $1.29, which would mean 19 per cent of the potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We look forward to further reductions in Fed's rates, which will result in a decrease in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"The long-term strength of the dollar may not allow current and budgetary deficits," says Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehra loses his weapon.
German MON confidential report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition items, according to a confidential set of RFN defences.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the Media Group EditorationsNetzwerk Deutschland (RNA).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Secretary of State's Office at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition have been recovered so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3, 11 automatic rifles G3, four automatic rifles G36, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, there are 30 barrels missing for MG3 machine guns.
The vice-president of the Leicester Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As RND journalists have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "restraint".
Moreover, the investigation has resulted in only a zero part of the equipment lost.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "poor balance sheet".
She also criticised the fact that the summary did not indicate whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against the Bundeswehra Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was charged with preparing attacks on leading German politicians with extremely right-wing and racist motives.
His "black list" of objectives, which came into the hands of the prosecution, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the defender of human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. unlawfully entered the possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunitions and more than 50 explosives.
The crying kids on the plane.
How do we avoid them?
There's a solution.
The carrier of Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people whose travel in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the line enables you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a person travels to a second year of age with a connection, the “child’s icon ” appears on a specific, parent - reserved seat.
Thus, the person using the service of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place away from that occupied by the young person.
The BBC states that the lines have already reported that the solution is not perfect.
"Children's icon" will not appear when the ticket has been reserved by a third party or if the aircraft has recently changed.
As you could have expected, the idea was shared by the interns.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by using headphones to reduce noise.
They're kids. We used to be kids, too.
"We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need maps of seats for breathing mouths, salivating or drunkards," wrote user G Sundar.
Others in the boarding school noticed that they once bothered his crying children on the plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the Japanese Airlines solution.
"Thank you for warning me about the screaming children during the 13-hour journey," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook travel agency
Over 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on October for a vacation to Majorca as a result of Monday’s bankruptcy by Thomas Cook travel agency.
As Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous government of Balearics, reported on Friday among 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take part in October vacation in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as the company Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month were German and Scandinavian citizens.
However – according to Pons – since Thomas Cook did not target tourists to the Balearic island during the November-April period, losses for the local economy will be lower.
He announced that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to estimates by the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 were fired from Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Other persons will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Majorki hotels, the owners of the premises demanded additional accommodation fees from guests.
The situation was experienced by, among others, several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had been suspended until at least the end of October due to the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and his cooperating companies.
In turn, Friday’s Diario de Ibiza magazine indicates that most Ibiza hotels that worked with Thomas Cook do not carry the intention of closing facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this balearic island, the British bankruptcy co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic autonomous authorities announced that they would call on the Spanish government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
The most injured tourists in this archipelago, some 36,000 people, were reported to be in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of around EUR 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland still at 29th place, USA at the head
The women's representation of Poland takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking on Friday.
In the same position, Coach Milosz Stępiński's team was classified in the previous July summary.
Weak game of staff.
How's October?
The leaders are left with Americans who have recently defended the title of champion of the world.
The second place in the ranking was maintained by Germany and the third place was held by Dutch women.
The Poles are preparing to qualify for ME.
They were supposed to start with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by one year due to food poisoning.
In this situation, Poland will initiate the qualifications for meetings with Spanish women in Lublin on 12 November.
Earlier, "White-Red" will play two social matches – October 3 on a trip to Cyprus and five days later in Kielce and Brazil.
There are representatives of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova in the Polish rival group.
The winners and the three best teams from other places advance directly to the final tournament.
The other six teams in second place will play three final passes to the European championships.
16 participants will be complemented by the host – England.
The men's representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog brought down the government
"The effects of Clean Air are zero, and the coal furnaces will dig up this winter as if nothing ever," we read on the first page of today's "Rzeczpospolite".
"So far, 82 thousand proposals have been submitted under the Clean Air programme to fund a total of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand have been positive.
The accepted proposals amount to more than 915 million PLN," says Rz, referring to the data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the paper notes, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The journal estimates the results of the announced noise program as "modest".
The sovereigns quoted by “Rz” face the failures of “Clean Air”, among other things, in too much bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, mail invoices, possible sampling of implementation.
It would make things better," says Mayor Lipzbark Warminsky Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smogova Alarm note that in the first year, less than 1% of the intended target of exchanging 3 million rolling boilers was implemented.
According to Rz, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, which is PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Environment and Water Management Fund for this year, €1.4 billion has been reserved," we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Błaszczak: Now the price negotiations
The U.S. Congress has agreed to sell Poland 32 of the state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"It is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price," the Polish Minister added.
Agreement on Polish F-35
The Polish air force has targeted 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to sell them.
The Communication stresses that investment will support national security and US foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay 6.5 billion dollars for the hunters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract would also include the provision of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of logistics and programme support and training.
Slayer Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II by Lockheed Martin is a one-time and one-engine hunter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close-up missions, bombings and typically flight-fighting tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, hunters are undetectable for close range radars.
Recently, F-35 hunters were bought by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with an ageing F-16.
The purchase of American warplanes is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie versus stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer of Barbie introduced a series of gender neutral dolls.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
The manufacturer of Barbie introduced a series of gender neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced the sale of a gender neutral doll.
"Creatable World" toys wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colors of skin and with different clothes.
It was also abandoned by stressing the characteristic gender traits – the gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long lips and thin waist or, in Ken's case, broad shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls when they have sex standards imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for specific sex inhibit the ambition of girls and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," said Mattel.
Barbie doll, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high heel shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy women's stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.
The concert responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different colors and more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: circle or club Together can have a dozen Members
Zandberg, asked on ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to Sejmu from leftist groups list (KW SLD from which list candidates start to SLD, Spring and Leicesters Together, starting with the common logo “Levica”), replied that it depends on the results of the committee.
"I believe that the results of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that the Left is not only right, but also strong," he noted.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 Members.
"This may mean that the circle or club together will have several Members.
But it's up to Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen," he said.
Asked if the Levica Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed to be diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity of Poles has been rewarded because we have shown that, in different ways, we were able to agree on a common agenda."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint launch is the leader of the SLD Vladimir Charzast, Zandberg replied that he thinks the largest beneficiaries are centrillers and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, saying that "the political party is meant to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to Sejm.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he indicated that he wondered.
"The offer is varied and there are candidates and candidates in this offer, to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"I will say, however, very honestly and clearly, that if I were in the Senate District 44, I would take the election certificate and vote in another district," he stressed the policy.
"I would not try to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujadowski (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
The leader of the RP citizens Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start in this district outside Udjejowski.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and pedestrian in the Bopp district, where a new mosque became available to accommodate 30,000 believers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brethren, belonging to the Sufite Nurtu of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares passed by the government.
The name of the Masalikul Jinan mosque ("The Ways to Paradise") comes from the title of the line Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century Founder of Brotherhood, worshiped by the professed Christians as saints.
The mosque is covered with cararean marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque has 15,000 believers in it, and the other may be on the outer planet.
In richly decorated interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and handmade decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is still no comparison of the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, Hassan II can accommodate 105 thousand believers in Casablanca.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government provided lighting, sanitation and road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Sneak: Our problem is not Silesia, we are ourselves
Eight league games pass without winning the Coroners will try to break in Friday's meeting with the Vycillider of the Silesia extraclass.
“Our problem is not spinning, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” stressed the coach of the kielčan Mirosław Smyla.
The last players of the Crown and so far the only victory in the League have been recorded in the first round when they defeated 1:0 beniamines of Częstochowa's Raków.
Later, the cheetahs recorded two drawbacks and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Deep Lubin in 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.
"It gives me optimism that in the last few seconds, football players fought for the goal, they wanted to resuscitate.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle did not result from a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smil.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why the team will be sensitive to the game in the side sectors of the battlefield.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.
In Friday's game in Corona, there will certainly not be a pause for too many yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, and there will be no injured James Zubrowski and Michael Gardaowski in the staff.
On the other hand, there are several players who want to play in the championship game.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would not be, and now he is," Smil said.
The defender of the Crown Daniel Strangel stressed that Silesia would not be an easy rival in breaking the pass of eight leagues in a row without winning, but in an extra class anyone could win with each.
"We are a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the field, but the moment will come that we will win and believe it will be on Friday," the footballer noted.
After nine queues, the crown's extracurricular with a total of five points takes 15.
Silesia gathered 12 more and is second in place.
The Friday match in Kielce will begin at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of Europe's tree species are at risk," the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN) warned on Friday's "Red Prince of the European Trees".
Among other things, there are chestnuts and flakes at the top of the list.
The IUCN, a organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It has been produced by specialists who, on the basis of research, have concluded that among the 454 species of trees present in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons for the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that exist only or mainly on our continent.
As far as European woodland is concerned, according to experts from the IUCN, 58% of species are at risk, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper mentions errors in the exploitation of wood, accelerated urbanization, too intense tree cutting, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and growth is also in grave danger.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose the risk of extinction in Europe of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," he summed up the Luc Bass report, which heads the IUCN European office.
Grzegorz Schetine: I do not promise 600+
"Today PiS wants to bribe Poles, offering them for their freedom of distribution for a loan that will have to pay future generations," Grzegorz Schetin says in a interview for "Rzeczpospolita".
In his view, "the whole PIS policy is pizza".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetine ensures in his conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has the idea of defeating the Law and Justice.
It's about mobilising the electorate at the polls.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczyński Party.
“Today, people who are conscious of living in a normal country are more than supporters of PIS, a party that has committed itself to the preaching values, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetine.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the president of the Civil Platform have also highlighted the basic objectives of the KO electoral programme.
"First, nothing that data will be taken, but it is necessary to set a course for the future, because the PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which appears even after dramatically low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work properly - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Schetina explains that in the KO programme, among other things, there was a project that would give the least earning Poles more than 614 zlotys on hand, and more money – a few hundred.
The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for shoplifting.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can, but not a promise of 600 plus.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers bid with the opposition to the deal until the financial collapse of the country has finally occurred," he stressed.
In his interview for "Rz" he also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to discuss with him and Margaret Kidava-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Pushes go before falling.
Kaczyński is a man of the state like Banas is crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for a presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of the Great
Six dead big condors were found in the province of Santa Cruz in Argentina – TVN24 reports.
Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Great condors are probably poisoned to kill predators such as pumas, foxes, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat toxic decay.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were grown.
"It is a great loss to the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine environmental organization.
"I think that the use of toxic bait and poison exposes not only this species to danger, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
They want a jewel for the president.
Work has begun on the granting of the head of the precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy's firm – we read in the "Rzeczpospolite".
According to the newspaper, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignum officially called during the interwar jewel of the Republic.
It's probably the last time President Ignacy Mosticki used it.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's arms.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Petition voted on Wednesday to adopt a proposal to amend the Orders and Dedications Act in order to restore it.
The newspaper states that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of heads of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it had passed away with one vote.
This time, work is quick.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the President's Office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I am kindly informing you that the Office of the President of the Republic does not comment on the position presented in this petition," President Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued and again devoted little time to the case.
"The President's office responded briefly: it is for this to be restored," said the head of the committee Robert Mammutow of PIS, quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a proposal to take the legislative work which the Commission supported.
Cops are gonna teach drivers how to drive through the intersection.
Police action will take place, among other things, at the intersection of al. Cieplinski from al. Pilsudski.
The uniform action is somewhat related to recent complaints by the city's authorities against drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive action in the Rzeszow "Transitional Crossings".
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of going down, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we are actually making life difficult for other drivers," Marek Ustrobinski, the city vice president, said a few days ago.
His words appeared at the press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of the inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which creates traffic traffic.
At that time, the president called on travelers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to text while driving.
The topic was taken over by the Soviet police, who are starting the "crossroads" action from now on.
What's going on?
The aim of this action is to eliminate the phenomenon of crossing restrictions by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing their driving.
This is a common offense that contributes to making traffic and traffic jams more difficult.
It is threatened with a mandate of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to the non-application of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity of driving, late movement from signalling, free crossings and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
On what intersections will action be carried out?
Among others, at Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonian Street; at Teplinski Street from Al Piłsudski; at Targow Street from Al Piłsudski; at Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or at Hetmanska Street from Warsaw Uprising.
This type of shares in the capital Podkarpatia will be held on Friday October.
They checked out the waste management company from "The Scissors"
“The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Volominski District and District Control Inspection checked the installation on Friday in the Zielonka municipality, where waste from the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of,” said the spokesman Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the Volominski mayor carried out checks at a plant located in the forests of the Zielonka municipality.
The private “Dar-Trans” Trade and Transport Company operates waste management services under the contract with the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant.
"The inspection of the installation was carried out, and an entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to its activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the audit report would be submitted, among other things, to the Regional Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The latest inspection in Dar-Transa was carried out by the Ministry of Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
At that time, it was found that the company did not collect samples, measurements and testing of groundwater, nor did it have the results of a study of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant.
After WIPO control Darius Saturday was called on to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Private Commercial-Transport Company “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Saturday is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste on the site of the product, the forests near the Greenhouse process waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year.
The Warsaw City Company Water and Canalation informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 the STUOS was excluded from operation, which was associated with the damage to one of the combustion plants.
According to MPWik, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Margareta Kidada-Błońska.
"You have done a difficult task, you can count on my complete support," Lech Wałęsa said on Friday to Małgorzata Kidava-Błońska.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word for me," said the candidate of the National Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the list KO in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now "only a quitter".
Małgorzata Kidava-Błońska met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
In a brief conversation behind closed doors, the son of Valása – Jarosław took part.
"You have done a difficult task," Lech Wałes said after the meeting.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
That is why I hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and all of us — those who love Poland — will support you as much as possible," said the former president, turning to Kidava-Blonska.
Very Important Words
Kidava-Błońska thanked you for your support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that you can do another smart policy together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and that is how we want to change Poland," stressed Kidada-Błońska.
Kibic on retirement
Valosa spoke to reporters and said that he is now “only a quitter. ”
"Of course I am looking at it.
I hope to reverse the course of events that we will return to what was good and tested.
The three-section of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And it all needs to be cleaned up, it all needs to be brought back to normal, and I believe this time we're going to do it.
Because if not, we will have a street criterion," Lech Wałes said.
"That is why it is so important for the Poles to go to the elections, think about it, and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," she said.
"The last chance that we will use a card to improve the state of things in Poland," the former president replied.
"We must build a new foundation"
Questions about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidada-Błońska said: "Mr President said very well.
We need to build on a new foundation where we can do all the other things.
If the three-section of power does not exist, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move one step forward."
ME networkers: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinal.
In the heat of Ljubljana, Polish retinas played with the Slovenians in the semifinals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Poles coach Vitale Heynen in the lead.
The "White Reds" lost 1:3 and will play a brown medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate has adopted without amendments to the law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important public officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the Law on the Property of Officials' Families, 14 against, three abstaining.
The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Slavomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilise" and to limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the property situation of own children, married children, children trained in cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials whose project was established in the Prime Minister's Office was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions provide that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, Members of the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the General Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the persons at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to place information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons in mutual use in a wealth statement.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Law on the Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who may be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for conducting the Central Lot Register.
Under the law – no amendments – 55 senators said, 12 opposed, four abstained.
Under the law, every flight of the President will be a "official mission" flight.
On flights, the President will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the President.
On the other hand, the mission of the official prime minister and the marshals of Sejmu and the Senate will only be "run to carry out the tasks directly related to the function".
The law also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the rules on board the aircraft, members of the delegation – invited Members, Senators, representatives of the public authorities and experts – may be included; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
In accordance with the Act, if there is any doubt as to the flights of Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of KPRM will ask for clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified in due time, the head of KPRM will be required to notify the head of the Sejmu office or the Senate of the lack of possibility of organising such a flight.
New Agent of Sport
Waldemar Paluch has appointed his official for physical culture, sports and tourism.
It was Arthur Christmas, president of the University Club AZS PWSTE Jarosław, for the last four years the director of the Office of the Rector of Jaroslav University.
Bartłomy Pacek Artur was recently deeply involved in the design of basketball reactivation in Jaroslav.
Arthur Christmas is not an anonymous figure in the Jaroslav sports environment.
Graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in White Podlaska since 2002 has been an instructor at the State Higher Technical and Economic School in Jarosław, and has served as the President for 15 years.
The Poles after the first training in Paris are waiting for the last rival
Polish networkers took their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will be performing at the Brown Medal on Saturday.
Vitala Heynen's way to win the title closed a Thursday failure with Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
It was loud about their troubles with the trip to this duel.
This time they lived without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went along with the Slovenian charter to Paris, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the classmates, the world champion was upset.
As Assistant Heinen Michał Miśzko Gogol noted, this time the main task was not just to train retinal elements.
"We went to the hall, but most of it was time for the team.
It was about spending it together more than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it as a team," he explained.
He confirmed that the semifinal failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have remained brutally brought to the earth.
Without doubt, we are disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to that game.
We were discussing this game with each other in the staff, and the coach talked to the players a lot.
As two main causes of failure, I would point to failure in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with the situational ball.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.
In his view, "White Red" was not an obstacle to the stress associated with the show against the audience supported by the loud and numerous partners of the tournament.
He admitted that the world's champions might have put some smooth way into the semifinals.
"Perhaps, if we failed in a group phase in a similar style, we would sooner analyze this lesson and later play in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a cadmage," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat of Poles will be translated into aggression in the bronze game.
"I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's a lot to fight about.
Last time we won the Medal ME in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group phase they went to Appledoorn, and for the semifinals they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban on launches and a fine of $25,000 in a six-year suspension for impeccable words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players are losing their patience with Kyrgios, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the crimes of the most unheeded professional tennis player in recent years seems threatening – 16 weeks of breaks plus a lot of fines, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a fur sport can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been working on his own tennis record for a long time, and he's had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsporting behaviour, insulting judges and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chachanov – after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he did not play for long, but was able to say publicly that ATP activists were "scorrupted", which hurt the organisation's authorities so much that they implemented disciplinary investigations against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the verdict to suspend the launch and the subsequent fine.
However, the words of corruption were forgiven after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.
In their argument, however, tennis players stated that the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgiosa over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious objections and constituted a continuous violation of the rules that it had constantly insulted the vulgar people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately delayed the execution of the judgment by ordering the fulfilment of several conditions within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, it cannot in any way violate the rules of the Code of Conduct applicable professional tennis players, in particular, it cannot curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, nor any other way to behave rudely and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also beyond the season consults with those who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not deal with proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment (in social media) to the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, since in the Lavera Cup, he had to give up his boat injury, so he had to give up his next start in Beijing (30 September-6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In ATP, Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – Washington and Acapulco, he earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he'll have plenty.
GUS: Poland is getting better and better
A report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday shows that as a good or rather a good material situation, as many as 44 percent of them assessed.
This percentage was 37.2 per cent in 2016, 33.5 per cent in the previous year and, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the household situation, it has never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1 per cent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad compared to 11.2 per cent earlier and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best material situation is the household situation of self-employed people.
In this group, over 70% of respondents thought she was good or rather good.
On the second pole there are households of renaissants, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is the knowledge of the parents alone who raise the offspring, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this weight varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60% and among childless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by parents who were raising offspring and multi-child families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, that is not all, since the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear correlation at voivodship level between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best estimates are made by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9 percent of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are still Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
However, in Opolski, the administrative revenue (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was in less than 94% of the national average and in Lubusk 98%.
The highest revenues were made by the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% national average) and Silesia (104%).
The average revenue per person in Poland was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after an impact correction for price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
In the background of the previous years, it's a pretty low score.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and one year later by 6.3%.
While revenue growth is slowing down, it also inhibits spending growth.
These per capita were PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person actually increased by 1.9 per cent and in 2016 by 4.3 per cent.
Household budgets surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory income, while in 2014 it was more than 80% and by 2006.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – an American Navy reported.
In the last two years, five crew members have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush blundered off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Besides, death is not meant to be connected.
"The need for everyone to commit to presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to point out that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, commander of the ship, on Facebook.
Non-Sylonically critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Piotr Leksyecki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, each of his opinions was accepted."
Then came the criticism of some of his actions.
"To me, John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rizik, he is a great shadow of his pontificate.
After all, this redemptor – the pest of the Church and of Poland – developed his media in the best yet alive of Pope Pole," he explained.
Former PO politicians admitted: “There were dissatisfactions, the pope said something, once Rizek did not take power, but for politics he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors," Nisiołowski explained.
“Besides, this unfortunate case of pedophilia and the Church’s actions and in fact their lack.
I ran a little ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to his entire life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he said in a conversation with journalist Nisiołowski.
In the assessment of the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of PIS.
"It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, and crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, became a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rizik are shaking the Polish Church that John Paul II has done nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally to PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the elephant will come to pay him," Nisiolowski argued.
"I hope that Pope Franciszek drives Jadraszewski, Rizik and a few others of this type," he summed up.

The PZPN is pouring curry for the yards in the stadiums.
Disqualified graph
The launch of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherow and Lechia Gdańsk by small hair did not end tragically when the fans from Wejherow race by millimeters passed the team goalkeeper, Zlatan Alomerovici.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The investigation of this case by the PZPN commission measured the Gryf's severe punishment, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed in the next match to their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to league games until December 31st either.
Burdy in the Vidzewa Stadium of Łódź also called the Silesia Wroclaw fans.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the Łódź ducks to be thrown away, burning chairs and forcing the economy.
This game was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the water supply.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next issue of PP.
The ban on trips also included leagues of Extracurriculars, but it will continue until December 31st.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKIA plans to exchange labelling throughout the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKIA Reichs
At Podkarpacie, the implementation of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the recording, inter alia, of the names of foreign cities on road signs also began in Polish.
For example, “Lviv” will appear next to “L’viv”.
In our province, the changes will be made on 94 road signs set on motorway A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's going to be easier, easier, easier.
The new guidelines are based on the revision of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the cities in the neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the change we have made, almost they will finally appear on the roadways in our path.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the Podkarpak section of the A4 motorway," said Andrzej Adamczyk, Minister of Infrastructure.
On Podkarpacie, the changes will be made on 94 road signs set on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand zlotys.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on motorway A4, which is scheduled to take place by 1 November 2019.
What is the realisation of the idea?
It's going to happen without a plate exchange, basically glue.
They will now replace the existing names of the cities, written in Polish, with the already existing characters.
Both names will be recorded in one line – first in Polish and then in original, in a brackets.
This will be a great relief for those who do not know the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Somebody shot a swan from a windshield.
In a pond in Zameczna in Lower Silesia, residents noticed swans having problems with their wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had prepared an animal’s target – in his body a windstorm was found.
"He received information about the wounded bird from the inhabitants of the village of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in New Sole.
The report indicated that the animal had broken its wings.
We made it to the scene.
It was obvious from the start that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him or to put extra stress on him.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was known that someone had made a shooting target out of it.
There were debris in his body," says Marcin Walasek, the CEO of Malpol's rehabilitation centre, among others.
She's staying at the center.
"The wounds have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, provided access to water, a safe place in the center where they will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly yet.
Letting him go now would relate to the fact that he probably would not survive the winter," Valasek adds.
Following the administration of the rehabilitation swan, the staff intends to release him into the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of Żukowice municipality, after receiving information on the contribution of animal health, intend to inform the Prosecutor's Office.
The event took place in Zameczna
Gowin: "We must encourage Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education said Friday, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement.
During the "Day Signs" interview in Radio Unit, Gowin said that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PIS government tried to face it at the very beginning of its term of office, but received “the counter from the KE”.
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will return to that topic," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, so small trade".
"There will be a need to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering that Polish retail tax was illegal public aid.
The Retail Tax Act established two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from the income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from the arrival of over PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC opened infringement proceedings by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then concluded that danina had been put into effect in a manner inconsistent with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland disagreed with this position, but tax collection was suspended.
The May EU court decision opened the way for tax re-entry, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed the appeal in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU's press service reported to the PAP that the matter is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. hearing of the parties and possible hearing, is in progress.
It takes a good few to a few months from the appeal to the judgment.
"This procedure lasts on average for a year," said the PAP source in the Court in Luxembourg.
How can a child be baptized?
We're moving up a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.
Often it is the first opportunity for the whole family to focus on the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
No wonder freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to be the best on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about the baby’s dress, see if it will also be convenient.
In the shops you can find many hardware kits that do not provide you with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The primary selection criterion for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, little ones were baptized, dressed in white sets and placed in the same barrels or big mattresses.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months, annual, or even older.
It is easy to realize that so much comfort is needed for something else to get baptized.
So if your child has 3-4 months on the day of baptism, it is likely that he will spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or on the hands of parents or baptismal ones.
The best way to do this will be to dress him up in comfortable, cotton sleeps or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered to be a everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its reverent variants, such as a falbank or a lace.
For the boy perfect points will be printed with flies and shells.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have a bigger imagination in your dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, necktie dress
Many of the parents of girls who are homesick look towards richly decorated, falbanian dresses for baptism in combination with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-respirational materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for suitable clothing will be better to look at Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant clothes on cotton soles.
Delicate, tiulian skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Perfect outfit for the little gentleman: cotton suit
Up until recently, the parents of the boys had fashioned the suits as a copy of the “adult” models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or cassettes often made young elegans loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today fortunately they have been removed by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, which is soft, jersey shorts, and the blouse decorated from the front to the waistcoat pattern.
These machines look extremely vindictive, but at the same time they do not interfere with the movements of a world familiar to the young.
Krystina Pawlovich published a wealth statement
Krystina Pavlovich made a property statement at the end of her term of office.
It shows that the PSI has gathered 110 thousand PLN in savings.
Let us recall that Paulicz announced that he had left politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of PLN 110 000.
According to a statement made by the Member of the Commission, she is receiving a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawlovich has an apartment worth 570,000 PLN and a little smaller, which he rents, collecting 880 zł a month.
The Ambassador also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment of PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a property statement.
Voting over the adjournment of the Conference of the Conservative Party
British parliamentarians voted against the three-day recess in the Gmin Chamber's deliberations during the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government asked for.
289 Members have been spoken against – 306.
The General Chamber does not normally debate during party conferences, so that Members do not have to give up either on their participation or on Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before Britain left the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
According to the government's request for a recess, 289 Members were spoken against 306.
Two opposition parties already following the conventions
The lack of consent to a recess can be taken as political revenge against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared inadmissible by the Supreme Court) and for refusing to apologize for it.
After that ruling, the Municipal Chamber resumed its session on Wednesday, and Johnson’s appearance and the following heated debate was the most important event of the day.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexit and avoiding early elections.
"The time has come to realize the brixite.
It needs to be implemented to honor the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit needs to come in so that we can deal with a contract on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester on the next Sunday and take place by Wednesday, 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour Party and Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave by explaining such a long suspension of Parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media reports.
The president's spokesman has clearly demented these reports.
"It is simply not true," he wrote on Twitter Blazej Spichalski.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to the "Jewish Insider", say that Andrzej Duda, in a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP Consulate in New York, declared that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He spoke to Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that "Police suctioned anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the ambassador of Poland to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polack, Polek."
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true," he wrote on Twitter Blazej Spichalski.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to Spichalski, the portal "has invented it".
According to the JI speakers, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, named Commander's Order of Credit for the RP Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda's words and say that it is the Jews of Israel "such as Israel Kac" who are responsible for the increase in anti-Semitism.
According to Botéach, Mosberg’s statement was to be interrupted.
Who is Banas, and what did he do?
The stonehouse rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Mariana Banasia's property statements.
We're looking at another affair that shook up the ruling camp.
The journalists "Supervisier" TVN have revealed that Marian Banas, president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered the property statement of the 400-metre building located on the Krakow Podgórz.
Moreover, his tenant had sex business in the mentioned building (so rent rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building itself has reportedly been a guarantee for repayment of the loan since 2016.
He drew the attention of Bertold Kittel in the Superviser program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia the stones were rented by people associated with the criminal world to use them as a place of “emotional meetings. ”
Customers were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banas' charges were answered vaguely and inconveniently.
Curiously, the stonehouse rented by the tenants led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The fireplace itself was described in a vague way, and the income from her rental was to be reduced.
"The mother of Mariana Banasia and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 million and PLN 8 million.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", says Money.pl.
And according to the portal analysis, the Banasia Stone itself was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Mariana Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until it was completed. "I will go to your marshals for free leave," he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
“We do not hear that CBA expands its investigation or accelerates the examination of the property claims of Marian Banasia.
That is why we are forced to administer the state authorities and to make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Maricz Witczak.
"If the normal Pole so greatly appreciated the rental of his properties, he would already have 10 checks, tax and karno-cash proceedings," he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Audit Chamber.
He was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was announced by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of the party.
Before Banas was associated with the NI in 1992-2005, he worked with the institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas took the position of the President of the Customs Service and also the Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat on the post of Head of Customs and since 2017 managed the National Treasury Administration.
Banas served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master puts graphic card grip on the market
The graphics cards can now weigh quite a lot, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been empty on the shelf decades ago.
This is the solution – the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphic card – presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphic card grip model is not only a functional solution to make sure that the graphics card is kept without relying solely on the durability of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of a police officer will be punished
According to the paper, disregarding a specific order of conduct issued by a police officer is intended to be a new type of offence, threatened with fines, arrest or restriction of freedom.
This is what police allies want to do.
The idea went to the Fair Commission on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million criminal cases go to Polish courts," we read.
The “Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition which the Independent Police Union writes to the Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording for Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It would read: ‘Who does not comply with the request or command of a public official issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law shall be punished by arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.’
"Article 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who, without taking orders, prevent or hinder the performance of their duties," the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolite" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political manifestations.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and rather than alleviate the situation, it would even sharpen it," he adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month they take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Topol's writing is in the blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important postwar Czech dramatists, today listed in one row with Václav Havel.
Hence, the curse of talent has been on Jachim from the beginning, which he has tried to exploit.
After eight years, he came back with "Amazing Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonya with two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a Shakespeare fan and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the second time he stayed in the time of the babies.
But it's not the heroes that are most important in this story.
All of them are just backgrounds to observe a world where there is no room for artistic nodules anymore.
It's a world of engulfed province, old society, suspicious people and divorced youth.
"A powerful man" turns into an absurd theater.
Narration follows didascalia, and hero talk creates this world.
Europe is full of fear for its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian Neckermann branch functions.
The company, however, has problems.
According to VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the office that were reserved in Belgium will be cancelled, but the holidaymakers will be able to receive the refund.
The Gandawi court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, around 12,000 Belgians live abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were scheduled to leave with the office by the end of the year.
As early as Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought the tour would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday on Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last-ever talks with creditors and potential investors.
Believers insisted that, in addition to the 900 million-million-pound rescue plan already agreed in August, the company would obtain an additional 200 million in winter insurance when travel offices usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

"I do not think Slovenia has played fantastically.
We're the ones who played very poorly.
This tournament has not yet ended for us," said the captain of the Polish network representatives Michal Kubiak after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semifinal of the European Championships.
Görlitz offers free accommodation in Germany
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrivals of German Görlitz.
The measures are designed to help combat the decline in the number of people living in the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel old woman attracts 140,000 tourists every year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city faces major problems.
Gorlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also struggles with a permanent loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went west, which was reduced by 25%.
In 2013, it was 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.
Two thirds of them put together residents of large cities.
The program was also attended by people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program would convince people to move to Görlitz," one of the project participants said.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
While the city authorities hope that some will take permanent action, the main objective of the programme is to get an opinion from the participants of the programme.
Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme of payments to promising young specialists for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
