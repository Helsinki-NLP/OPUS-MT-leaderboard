I've read this book.
You've always been a little weird.
Go practice outside.
I can't fix the fridge.
Where's your father?
It's not Tom's book.
Be very careful with that.
I just wish I could speak French a little better.
What would you have done if you were 10 years younger?
Yumi's going to be a teacher.
I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Why don't you put on a dress?
How do you view his attitude toward us these days?
Are there any more seats available?
I think you've done enough.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Mary threw her eye at Tom.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave him for another time.
What's the weather gonna be tomorrow?
I'll clean it up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you so much!
I don't care what you think.
These socks don't come loose in the laundry.

I barely understood it.

Tom didn't kiss anyone.
Tom has a map.
I bought it.
I've learned a lot.

I wish I could continue with the French.
We graduate tomorrow.
Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and scolded.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is covered in leather.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
To speak French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
This spring is late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much lower.
You didn't give me as much change as you should.
Maybe I can find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't very busy.
It's been raining for five days in a row.

Let's ask her something else.

There you are.
The robber grabbed the bag from his hand.
Please leave immediately.
Does it smell sweet?
She was worried she might be late for the train.

Come on in.

Tom, lock the door.
I have to get back to work.

I'm really tired.
I only have ten books.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
Excuse me, how much is that?
It's time to reflect on your past.
Will he recover?
I'm starting to understand it's gonna be impossible.
I waited three days.
He had no idea when to start.
Wet clothes stick to the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Take this road and when you get to the light, turn left.
Tom knows I'm home.
Don't miss this opportunity!
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
Be careful not to fall.
You're my best friend.

You're gonna need this again.
I'm happy for her company.
Did you pay your phone bill?
We're done here, so we can go.
Hand over your homework!
Nothing interesting is going on in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I get it.
You confused him with someone else.
Tom went to see a doctor.
I don't care why.

The shirt needs to be smoothed.
Tom won't be here in time.
What's he doing today?
He almost got himself killed.
One glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing just fine.
You don't understand.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
There was a picture of him in his letter.
What are you wearing in your suitcase?
Tom died yesterday.
We go to an edie school, too.

Looks like they're onto it again.
I'll take that into account.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret to herself.
Is that your pen?
He disappeared untraceable.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that's what you should expect.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish has finally come true.
Would you like to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They're serving excellent food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'm going to study French this afternoon.
I've had a hard time solving this problem.
How long will it take?
They're so much like each other, I don't know what it is.
We got very bad luck.
Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
My rain stopped me from coming.
Ken calls me every day.
Our departure was postponed.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve sympathy.
Can't you do that?
No, they're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
I missed you so much!
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
It'll be a start.
How much sugar do you put on?
Looks like she's got a lot of girlfriends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover themselves with leaves.
Watch my fingers.
She speaks good English, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You didn't eat from the cake I made; and your sister ate.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't feel like speaking French today.
I think that's yours.
Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on a diet.
Speak out loud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Are you coming back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I admire the culture and courtesy of the Germans.
My friends call me Ken.

I don't want Tom making things any worse.
He was the master of the situation.
I have to read this book.
He married the stewardess.
Everyone's waiting for you.
What he loves is jelly.

Let's talk in English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time you go to the beach?
Don't back off.
Because it was raining, we didn't go to a picnic.
I wish Tom could have been here with us today.
I'm in the house.
Do I have to open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I need to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
We were thrilled by the news.
Are you cold?
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak some French.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They're getting along with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your place.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's your target?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a really good time.
I forgot his name.
We're in no hurry.
She's more shy than a social one.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale live.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I'm not gonna ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom has to do.
I think you should be crazy not to go.
These people are very lucky.
I've waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruit is good for you.
He has a good sense of humor.

I've waited too long for this moment.
Do your children speak French?
I bought some Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Did I interrupt something important?
The patient was getting a little better.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Over my dead body!
What's the minimum wage in Morocco?
That's weird, isn't it?
My joints hurt.
Let's go talk in the other room.
I have to go there.
I heard Tom's getting married.
Tom didn't know a word of French when he first arrived in France.
Your flight's been cancelled.
I heard you talking to Tom.
Are you sisters?
I thought there was something strange.
You live here?
I can't find Tim.
I can't feel my left foot.
What's in the basket?
I've got paperwork.
I'll go with you.
Please sign here.
My father visited my uncle at the hospital.
That's enough.
The soldiers refused to obey the order.

You must know you're facing a crisis.
I don't have a ticket.
There are no sentences in English in Tatoeba that contain the word "Lego".
Where's your school?
He owns at least a hundred coins.

He took the exam.
Am I invited?
I have no proof of that.
I love turtles.
He doesn't have children.
The young girl burst into tears.
Are you John?
Your shoes are untied.
I'm going to bed late at night.
That's what you decided.
I think you're perfect.

In case of fire, use the stairs.
Are you happy, Tom?
I have faith in you.
Mary likes to watch TV.
She's her friend.
We'll be together soon.
She's messing with you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a medieval wedding.
We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to find out who Tom is planning to give it to.
Unbelievable!
That's all you can really do.
It's time to get a good-bye.
France borders Italy.
Simple numbers are like life, they're perfectly logical, but the rules for them can't be discovered, even if you spend all your time thinking about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I've been working this week the whole time.
It happened today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show us.
There's nothing on his plan.
Do good to those who hate you.
I intend to complete this project.
I'm just looking.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
It's like the last precautionary measure of his fist and flashlight in his backpack.
I've never had this kind of trouble before.
His car's two years old.
I don't think Tom knows French.
It won't be that hard to convince Tom.
Tom bought a gift for his son.
If it was up to me, I probably wouldn't be doing this.
I'm not jealous.
I have a problem with my back.
They're having a party for Sam.
Jane is the president's secretary.
The doctor was taken over by a sick boy.
My French knowledge is no one who knows cocoa.
Who owns this car?
You need to be careful.
Look in the back.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom blamed Mary's death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
That meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than he is.
I think it's OK.
What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else I could go.
The man pushed her aside.
One hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We've been waiting a little bit.
I hear Boston was nice this time of year.
What's your nickname?
Neither Tom, nor Mary, can cook them.
Raising prices feed consumer concerns.
I think you'll like Boston.
I've heard every word.

She wants to know who sent the flowers.
It's not worth discussing.
Tom said you'd come.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He refused to speak to her himself.
That's a beautiful picture.
He didn't say anything that made her angry.
That's too little.
I've never seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was injured in the crash.
The question now is how.
I like to speak French.
There were widespread rumors of defeat.
It's very short.
Stop coming back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of being on time if everyone else is late?
The wind was blowing directly into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear this?
I think you'll be happy.
That's not a problem at all.
Did you leave a tip?
Looks like nobody's home.
I'm gonna have to decline this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
He has full confidence in the merchants.
These are the most awful shoes I've ever seen.

What's Tom's address?
Those two shirts are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Did you write your homework?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom doesn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
Christmas is coming.
I intend to win.
A lot of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we need to help Mary.
They hired a Hamalan company to move their stuff to their new address.
Can you tell me the way to the station?
Tom wasn't up to it.
This guide could be of use to you on your journey.
Is your watch true?
Give me one more chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like gardening.
They've been chattering on coffee for over two hours.
It's an honor to be here.
Anyone here speak French?
I think Tom should start dating other people besides Mary.
Mary just missed the train.
Have you seen Tom?
I took the first step.
Watch where you're going.
He's considered missing.
Tom took off his tie and started unbuttoning his shirt.
Maria is young and beautiful.
What about you?
It's not that simple.
I've never seen you here before.
Tom feels uncomfortable among strangers.
Number to ten.
My Twitter account is stopped for spam.
The girls are face-to-face.
Please don't.
Start now.

How are you?
What are my other options?
I like hard-boiled eggs.
I realized what was going on.
Don't forget me.
I heard you were looking for me.
I think I'll get to the end despite her disagreement.
All the news can't be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She read all my books herself.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I can see how confusing this is for you.
She despised him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I have to admit, I was worried.
You don't seem very happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting profession.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
That sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I'm not betting anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom's buttoning his shirt.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We're a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can make it through my savings.
Which is ours.
I have the same number of books he has.
It rained yesterday.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should choose Tom.
I'll give you five bucks.
I think Tom did really well.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were terrified of the news.
My nose is clogged.
I'm as strong as you are.
Get in there.
Tom says he's hungry.
I'm an old friend.
Is that your umbrella?
Is it possible that the washing machine could be repaired?
People used to live in the country.
I want to be a teacher.
You're crazy to buy such a expensive bike.
I'm very lonely.
I waited a month.
Please explain the rules to me in football.
That's a really stupid idea.
Last night was fun.
Are you happy?
Is there water on Mars?
It's okay.
Tom won't be at the bank at this time.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Looks like you've made a significant success of the last time I saw you.
The station's downtown.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The object is outside the scope of this investigation.
You sat in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I don't have any French books.
Although I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget Tom doesn't understand French.
I plan to go there.
A beautiful redhead landed on the front of my room.
I bet you'll make a great father.
Good night!
Someone has to go for help.
They say you play nice on the banjo.

There were 30 witnesses.
He cursed her fate.
I found the key under the eraser.
From what I understand, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to come up with a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I overheard you talking to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to get toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
That hat doesn't fit me.
What's the minimum wage in South Africa?
He is on a diet because he is slightly overweight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You take something to drink, you break your way through your elbows to the Swedish table, and you eat like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were dating Tom seriously.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't give lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's cocky.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to find an account.
I heard you talking.
We immediately became friends.
Tom spent the weekend at his beach house.
Black looks good on you.
You know everything about me.
Let me think about it and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants pocket.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's quite wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field produce?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
Way to go, you've got a curved path.
Can you give me a light?
He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found work as a typewriter.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
It's clear that Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even think they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a shot.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was terribly cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were worried sick.
I think you'll be pleased.
Teenagers have left.
I wish I was rich.
I'm just getting started.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot of things.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my email had even reached you.
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to pick up his keys with his toes.
His teaching method is both good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a small suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that it had nothing to do with the matter.
I love parties.
This is the camera I bought yesterday.
Short skirts are out of fashion.
I think we're gonna need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please say that one more time.
I think so.
Many museums don't work Mondays.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he's eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Green looks good on you.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the beach.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sassayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the weather gonna be tomorrow?
Are there any kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand what's important.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a denarius.
The girls danced in the salon.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped in front of the old house and saw the city one more time.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoreing.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buckled his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she treats everyone well.
Ken plays football every day.
You can come back anytime.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Could you wait outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train passed 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact.
The principal considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were on the West Coast.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers across southern Germany will see farms with solar panels everywhere and look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we haven't known each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know him that well.
I'll tell you the truth now.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
For the last ten years, he's been living here.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is linked to national features.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I have to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be an astrophysicist.
Tom threw up.
That's Tom's camera.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The game was postponed indefinitely.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken's arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
Thieves robbed a museum.
He's crazy about you.
He comes inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put her coat on.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's mean.
What's the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm shopping with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father rarely smokes.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wronged the address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at lunch.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's a lot older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike was running really fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know someone you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
I couldn't make them understand me.
Do you speak French, too?
I just started studying French recently, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom's still living with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have a sister.
Tom has small arms.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before we do.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I can't get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists has arrived.
The door slammed and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy talking to Tom.
The twin brothers look completely alike.
Don't hang around Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how much time I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted an invitation to visit Mary's celebration.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily ever after.
I'm mad at myself.
This was done manually by Tom.
You won't believe the things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry a lot of luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
Blame her for lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given an advantage over the rest.
I tricked you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He mocked me publicly.
The circle is on fire.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Ah, I was sick.
We're in position.
Turn it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all thought that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I'm not blaming you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do what you want; but I will prevent it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim during the vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not going to let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right by the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
The one who sows the winds will reap the storms.
According to the latest census, the country's total population is just over 7 million.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I've got nothing.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
Chat-time I think about it.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick it up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French employees.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's having a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so swollen, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He sure loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She seems a little unwell.
Is Spot gone, too?
I promise I'll get it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together at the library?
I have a job to do.
The job proposal is still in effect.
You're missing a button on your shirt.
I have to go out for a while.
Green suits you.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but right now, I don't have enough money.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis last night?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
This store has kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay till the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's about to snow.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never climbed the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jump.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat one living frog every morning and nothing worse will happen to you throughout the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia loses 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you're gonna have to loosen your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're studying French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
Tom wanted to be single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I had pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my checking account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in ?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got a six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something in person with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary had disappeared.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In esperate, the essentials end with an "o." Multiple numbers are formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I'm washing my clothes.
I've heard French is a difficult language.
I didn't really eat.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you learn French?
Carol's back at her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He's off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
Still no mention of Tom.
Pass it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I woke up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than it is in French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've already done my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
There's not much left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated on in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom searched the drawer to see if there was any pen he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't feel comfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You need to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
His ignorance, of course.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is no good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atushi may have been ill.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated Cambridge with distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Is Tom studying French at school?
What kind of shoes are they?
We've definitely done our best.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He began to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'm gonna help you get better at this.
My dad runs every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has a wonderful handwriting.
The fingers on the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and puppy.
Folio is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How long does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiasted began his worthy undertaking.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more specific.
I'm on vacation this week.
You're washing your socks.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't speak French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I have no doubt of his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you mind telling me your name, please?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time to leave.
She dresses every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak in French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make my eyes feel good.
I don't have any money.
Milly eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long poles are now a demo.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We really had fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, the snow stopped raining and the weather got warmer.
She wasn't much of a hint about what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some of the poisons used properly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You're making me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but right now, I don't have enough money.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just walk around like that, start yelling at people's addresses.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got into a traffic jam, and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the Sea Museum.
Tom is making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you "stupid."
I'm speaking French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you finish, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What have you got to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lay down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan has failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I'm just done with breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting would be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's reached adulthood.
Come with me and take a walk.
I'd love to watch the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared, don't worry.
Yesterday was fun watching TV.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves the silk beetles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?

Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.

The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
What's the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?

Patients often die simply because they bend to their disease.
I wouldn't think tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
Now what time is it?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't lost my vertigo yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
This one's mine, I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned how to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm sick of the wreath.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about this, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the fair.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.
I'm not being ominous.
There's good food in this restaurant.
I don't do that.
Are they confused?
You parked in my spot.
I don't know where he is.
Unemployment is what makes you.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
The prices have fallen lately.
Tom's an interesting guy.
Are you trying to take me down?
If you're late for the transmission, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I can't take Tom across the bridge.
Where do we go?
You can't be mad at me about this.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in that pond.
I understand that perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?

He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred is often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't fix anything with crying.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love parties.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend is coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope this happens.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was quiet.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can learn here.
Let me help you.
You're gonna love it!
I'm afraid I've touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put those shoes on, please.
I heard it was good.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'm going to study French next semester.
Tom's not giving a speech today.
I'll see you tonight.
I ran out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?

Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember meeting you before.
I see him as my best friend.
Nobody answered the phone.
I've seen you before.
You're studying Esperante.
My new bike costs me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Save it until later.
They're best friends.
You're the problem.
You're so superficial.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel collapsed because of the earthquake the other day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Shut the damn door!
We made fun of him.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the offer, so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
A barber is a man who shaves his beard and cuts the hair of men.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is this yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here.
Tom loved to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should reconsider.
I'm not being mean.
I'm the most ordinary office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out a way to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I won't be there in time.
He often walks to school.
The shells stink.
When is she getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're cruel.
How many episodes of Van Pise have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're cute, and you're cute.
My sister lives next door to Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
That wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm asking you a lot - spray with a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She accused me of not answering the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your luggage.
Soon after, it started raining.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permits.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says good-bye and wishes me a good night.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him herself.
I got a job for Tom.
Where did you dump them?

"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried it that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this bathroom.
You're on a winning streak.
I want a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for anything but to take care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number's in the book.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She hangs out after dinner.
These containers are hermetically closed.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more information.
Are you carrying a gun?
He says he avoided the danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm coming out.
Isn't that surprising?
He makes friends with everyone he meets.
You need to study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't get it.
He broke into a house.
I came later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling with fear.

I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was wearing red flannels.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say "cheese."

They're both alive.
I'm too low.

Do you care?
Apparently, Tom was famous before he released that album.
The Romans would not have had any chance of conquering the world if they had first been required to learn Latin.

That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table already!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.

He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone told you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.

We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.

See if you turned off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped in the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about your life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that thing to your parents.
Let's be honest.
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.

I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We lined up to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My father will cook me a delicious meal tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom, just hang up the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?

They spoke too quickly to find out what they were saying.
Tom's down, call an ambulance!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can I trust her?
This is the camera Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't feel like shivering.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the cabinet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's kind of weird for me.
Can you do it yourself?
In the spring days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad sing in the bathroom.

Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The pear's burnt.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.

It's either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.

Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's a bit of a celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as funny as the book.
The job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is a part of everything called by us the universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our own desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I'm familiar with it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.

I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Who did you translate this for?

Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having a good time.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I have a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.

I guess that won't be a problem.
Slow down, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."

Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use deodorant.
When I'm up, you're up.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing this.

This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.

We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
I study French every day at school.

Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Aren't you afraid of something?
He hasn't known anything since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.

I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everybody's hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I was studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid due due due for a lack of supervision, please send the amount due and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're on your own.
The question is being considered.
Tom was rescued by a random passerby.
City Hall's downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
That's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.

She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happy.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What's he trying to do, Tom?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little smooth.
I think we better go.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?

I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he was gone for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were intrigued by Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a venous infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
You think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see him again, it probably was worth it.
This is Jane's purse.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Are you a French student?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom was having a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of sayings about DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter's married.
Tom speaks French a lot better than any of his classmates.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I have a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home on a train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He must be the headmaster of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
I find it awkward in her presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs, and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
In those days, there was neither television nor radio.
She went to the museum with a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't date.
It'll be good if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We got here fast because the movement wasn't loaded.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back recently from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses look good on you.
What'd you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
It doesn't eat until it's over.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you gonna do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hi, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Uighur sentences in Tatoeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cross here.
I know this is difficult.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not take care of the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt rejected by these people.
I think you'll have a good time tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his greatest flaw.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers gush without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and in the meantime drop this letter.
This hen hasn't laid a single egg in a while.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people are gonna lose their jobs because of the car industry shrinking.
He came to my aid.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's at an end.
The moment of fame for Hunshin did not last long. They were quickly moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that cause any trouble?
He's upset that he's called a fool.
Their condition is deteriorating.
You really want this?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What are the findings?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the front of the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, that's too bad!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Aren't you intrigued?
It is a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start studying French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I already did my job.
It wasn't easy.
You think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you dump them?
Tom, how is he going to deal with this?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This is Tom's camera, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Go through that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
This isn't much fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
I'll see you in a new meeting.
I'm exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Budstrasse and get off on Zestrasse.
Laughter is good for your health!
This isn't a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Advanced".
When the sun of culture is low, even dwarfs cast a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give in to the threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Do you have a shot?
I hope it's helpful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's up late.
Tom's doing fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom would cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put water to boil, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the highways are covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want some orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like French.
I think we need to make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate to fly.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I climbed up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this around in paundi.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the uneven road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind you.
She took her exam.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I've made some mistakes on the exam.
This book is not owned by Tom.
Where was that?
I've got to get him out of here.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a mature man now.
Let's not fool around.
I'm better.
It's not art, it's a tooth vagina.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so resilient.
Have you heard of him?
She washed her shirt in a hurry.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you wear different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, baby.
Tom had a one-only wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's going to rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I won't be able to help you.
He got out from under the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men get in shape driving a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just squeeze your thumbs.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep countryside.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She was twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What can that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What is your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come on down.
Mary's getting caught.
They yearn for the city's life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was going around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a stick of a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discussing it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw out those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by panic attacks.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you do that?
I think you've had enough.
You told me that another time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom barely understands anything from French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner spends a lot of electricity.
Don't get involved in this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be abolished.
First the good God made the man, and then made the woman, and then he took pity on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Machines can do a lot of things for people today.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from a flat foot.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of this self-criticism, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road goes up the hill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't fit in the lock.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom, turn the light back on.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you're gonna find Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so many bad wreaths, she hardly even has any teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try on the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They went straight to their destination.
The boy came through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandpa's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you in love with Tom?
Persistence pays off.
They arrived separately.
To speak French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe Earth is being watched by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking around the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you should put your beard on.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soft drink?
A lot of people share my view on this.
The blouse is clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his great endeavor at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
A child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl between the crowds.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, and I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated from Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
Milk makes cheese and butter.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I wasn't serious about that.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
I'm surprised this building still stands.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakone.
Go through these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom set off the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
You boil 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I never gave you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it out?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather has prevented us from leaving.
Now I'm learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm terribly busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on the winning streak.
I can't be mad at you about that.
The distribution of television has greatly deprived us of our time to read.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't sneak into my closet.
The new coronavirus is very contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here informally.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toasted cup.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me very significantly.
It's forbidden to smoke in the school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people can speak well, while others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom took his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a God?
I'm walking the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I never should have let you do this alone.
Convicted of death.
I've only been waiting for five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsch" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom got his knees cut.
I'll go back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over 40.
Are you wearing the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is rekindling.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't spoken to anyone today except Tom.
I can barely hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average large amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What is this really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
For the third quarter, GNP exceeded 1 per cent of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything in there?
They were all at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
It wasn't as much a disease as the lazy one.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog is watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He sometimes watches TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't bother us so much.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's why Tom won't know anything.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself never to do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans failed.
I haven't seen you in days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think that's true.
I lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
Basho is the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.
Tom, put your knee back on.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They've got five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How you doing, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Put the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father arguing with him.
Keep your room clean and tidy.
I've had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I studied his face for wear marks.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
I'd love to sing about you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I can't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Watch me do it.
We're going to the movies.
He often goes to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was terminated.
I'll be by your side if you go and do it.
What's the name of the Boston Hotel you stayed in last year?
It's a complex problem.
It's 10:00 now.
It's raining like a bucket.
You're a bachelor, too?
He's known as the great poet.
We won't be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse standing there.
I was buying books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like to play sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, if you please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest medical innovations are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing that.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it down as a lost cause.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the towels?
You need to get a real job.
You two have nothing in common.
A lot of scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't do that.
You're a good singer.
The cat eats.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.
Speaking of trips, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educated his children well.
I was just being nice.
Tom raises tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks young shy.
It's made out of Tom.
You can read French, right?
I'm so sleepy.
Be more specific.
I was on vacation.
No one will know.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom wasn't wearing his belt.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where is the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me my magazines.
She tied him to a chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Have you been in debt yet?
Can you teach me how to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
There's something I need to tell you first.
A cup of coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have a choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy looked pale to his father in appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop for me.
How do you tell them apart?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has alcohol problems?
Is there someone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard from him in months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
I kind of understand that question.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the guy who gave me this bike.
We will not fire under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom is a mystery.
I wear sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom is so angry.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you weigh that?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?
I'm not supposed to speak French very much.
Ask him about the road to the station.
He used to go fishing in the daytime.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I give up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works at the wine cellar.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six in the morning.
She makes me uncomfortable.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The raisins are dried grapes.
I've been to India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of that awful scream made him tremble.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Amy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took my things off.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no room for concern.
We've got physical.
Did you have fun last night?
This sweater is worth over fifty dollars.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the shop.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get all wet.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, you'll need them later.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
That book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I'm on Highway 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I've got nothing.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a flight to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my watch.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's work?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone is a comfort.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I could barely handle the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom is very modest.
Thank you for that.
Ala proma niki, Turkish panic, oh giddy vancho, our captain.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to go to.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We have a lot of lotus leaves.
We firmly believe that when I make up sentences, the author must avoid succumbing to harmful habits inherent in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely unnecessary in light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When's it over?
I get sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He didn't pass the exam.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Good-bye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilos of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that near your house?
Jane filled out one statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You shouldn't say things like that when there's kids around.
He flutters easily.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's been silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You're learning French, aren't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we can find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better and better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an interrogation on the date of the exam.
Maybe he's avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan virtually every family has a washing machine.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The Raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're shivering.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hi to Tom.
I think Tom might be drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, an unbeliever.
There's little chance I won't make it to the meeting.
He always congratulated me with a gift.
How would I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's OK, right?
She took a short look in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy is buried in the Arlington cemetery.
I'm not giving up.
What do you care?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to the Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work hard.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very hot lately. My favorite football team is going down.
It was easy for me to relate to the sweet talk.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language bearer.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while there's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room is a mess.
They spend some of their free time taking care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay three more days.
We delayed leaving for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know borders.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John were here, I wouldn't have to come.
You better put your sweater on under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is that?
I heard you laughing.
I totally erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims too fast.
Add this site to "Advanced".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what concerns you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain, and the man soon died.
I noticed you weren't home last night.
Threatening us.
You want to buy this skirt.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French.
You're leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They set up the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been keeping my dailys in French for the last three years.
I'm a lot bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
It's either him or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing only.
I play in a group.
The birds are singing.
Tom finishes work at 5:00.
Although Tom left early today from home, he was late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
There will come a time when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they take the bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be precise.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: who has gold, he sets the rules.
The house is haunted.
Tom's going into town.
Everything that's not forever is forever aged.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You always disagree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should pick Tom.
Something's happening.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
What beach do you like to go to?
You can always give a part of the job to younger employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't make a man believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioner's not working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Is there something that scares you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid 200 bucks in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
You made me do it.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up this watch for a little bit, and not even talking about splitting up with him in the end.
He didn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
I shower every morning in the summer.
Buckle up your shirt.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't get to his speech in time.
I prefer grapefruits to oranges.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister smoothed her shirt.
I told you that another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time left?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I got your book until I left it, I was always laughing, and one day I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter is tight for the round.
I've seen that, too.
The dolphin is a species of mammal.
What color are these?
He shook his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She set up a room with beautiful furniture.
The pocket calculators can be bought at the price of a pair of socks, and they are needed by thousands of British children at school, no less than pencil and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I borrow money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom runs around like a headless chicken.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people went to the meeting.
He put on his coat and got out of the house.
Tatoeba's new website will slide home hyper database from a search engine, and it will go to a dadebook-OS server with a tattooed CPU made entirely by papabius.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it a lot.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I completely forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's papers.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting on too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden are inhaled.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, what would you choose?
The answer is yes.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This kind is threatened.
I think you'd better go to bed.
I like you very much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on packs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Be careful, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved more sensitive to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to study things.
So we're all in agreement.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie looks really good on you.
I think you're gonna make a great dad.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is Switzerland's capital.
You won't believe me.
Can you come at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a carefree shop?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
And if I'd told you, Cal fide.
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
He looks like a man from afar.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter what she's told.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not be hasty.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is grown-up milk.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I have nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Oui!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deep asleep.
She called it what she didn't.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were caught in the cold.
It's okay for dogs.
Kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated you, Tom.
Go ahead.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we can make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in, like, three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone mediocrely sends a message into a bottle, it's just a childish fantasy. When Christopher Columbus sends a message to a bottle, the fate of an entire country is on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.
Kids play Dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room with no clothes on.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works shows nothing he can boast about.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She pushed the door a little bit.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote several sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
Then I visited the museum for the first time.
Is she staying at the hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary came down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I give up.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your car trunk?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't go, Tom.
Dima slept with 25 men for one night and then killed them.
I don't care if that's true.
I don't blame anyone.
I will never forget your kindness.
No toilet paper.
You sat in my seat.
I don't speak French as well as Tom.
She got good English marks.
What do you want?
Three months before Tom finished college, he died.
I hope John comes.
I'll open the wine and let him breathe.
I'm doing fine.
Your education is important.
Tom stole your bike.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
It happens.
Did I say something wrong?
When you get to the light room, turn right.
