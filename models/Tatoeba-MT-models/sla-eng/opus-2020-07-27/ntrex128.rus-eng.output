Members of the Wales Assembly do not wish to “go to the Mappets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to adopt MWP (member of the Welsh Parliament of Wales) is gratifying.
The issue involved plans to change the Assembly ' s name to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes about this abbey.
One Labourian, expressing his party's views, expressed concern that the new abbreviations “rhymed Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales, but from Wallia twp, meaning “tupica”, but from pwp to“ duck”.
According to the Assembly member from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole “was not satisfied” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviations, but note that MWP is close to being written to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken approximately as a letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting a draft law on the replacement of the title, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be appointed will, of course, remain behind them”.
The Welsh National Assembly Act of 2017 has the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the Parliament Wales option, instead of the Assembly, found broad support for the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of the Wales Parliament” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the option of MWP received the greatest support from the public.
It appears that the members of the Assembly are offering other options, but it will not be easy for the presiding member, Elena Jones, to find a satisfactory solution.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on their name change
Macedonians will vote on Sunday to rename the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The public vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name Republic of Macedonia implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on change of name, said that he was not going to accept his results.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country's name is the whole price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Harlem Revenues: St. Martin’s Wheels Silenced Forever
“The guards of the area I was talking to said that they used to be at every corner in the bar and in the church,” says Adams.
“And now there is none left.”
The disappearance of bars is still understandable:
“Communication has changed.”
“Bar has ceased to be a kind of hospitality of the entire area to which they came regularly.”
But as far as churches are concerned, it is concerned that the funds obtained from the sale of assets will be sufficient for a short period of time, however their leaders may expect.
On the site of the church, he added, there would be a multi-bedroom house, whose residents would hardly support the preserved revenues in the area.
“The majority of the buyers of these apartments will be white, ” says Adams. “And that will be the day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their followers.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Communes in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left their arrival in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black income stationed next door.
When St. Martin's church moved into the hands of a black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where they refused to hire or raise black people.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire, and during the reconstruction work, Father Johnson’s visitors ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who turned him into the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon “cologs for the poor. ”
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it “a cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that he was the first black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, to be the world's first ever to be invited to play on a larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriuezer, St. Martin's church still has no replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin's Church have been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church diocese.
In July, a parishioner, the governing body of the arrivals of secular leaders, turned to the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the value of work” to a meeting of visitors, although the latter had no relation to the selection of architects and contractors assigned by the diocese.
Some visitors expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old diver fishing for lobbyists
Official sources report that on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by sharks and injured in California.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bikon Beach Beach Beach in Enzinitas.
According to Chad Hammel in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with his friends and heard the boy screaming for help about half an hour later, and they set sail on the boat to the place of attack and dragged the adolescent out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was overjoyed at the notion of the lobby, but quickly “suggested that he was shouting, ‘ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Upon reaching the diver, Hammel observed that “he had completely severed his skin around the lock.”
“I shouted to get everyone out of the water, ‘Here is the shark!’” Hammel said.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Reddy Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
During the press briefing, the savior of Captain Larry Geils reported that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had not been classified as dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach of Swami in Enzinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Geils noted that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to conquer the British perfume-cosmetic market
Seinsbury is going to set up cosmetics and perfumery offices in Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists, modeled by luxury universities.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds sterling and continues to expand, while fashion and household goods are falling, and in order to capture a significant share of the desired market as an experiment in 11 stores throughout the country, there will be spatial cosmetics and perfumery offices, and if they are successful next year, they should be expected in many other stores.
The owners of supermarkets are looking to fill up the shelves previously placed under TVs, microwave ovens, home goods, and investment in the perfume and cosmetic market seems to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinesbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic goods to 3,000 names; including for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by type of product organization in Boots stores.
In addition, a company line of Boutic Cosmetics products will be reorganized to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two Seinsbury stores will be represented by the Fragrance Shop perfumers, the first of which has already been opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy small quantities of products every day in small benches near home have led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinsbury, says that the outlets will gradually turn into a department store, and his network of supermarkets fights for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidle, offering more services and non-food products.
The Argos cars have been placed in hundreds of supermarkets, and in some of them, Habitats stores have now been found since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which has resulted in an increase in the sale and purchase of food products.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinesbury and Boots was organized, but then there was disagreement between participants about the distribution of drug sales income in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinesbury pharmaceutical business (only 281 stores) to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for £ 125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of luxury facilities to care for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumery and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants, who will always be ready to assist the Council.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable shopping will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones "angry" responded to Holly Willoughby's 11 million pounds deal.
Peter Jones, the star of the "Lead Dragon" show, was angry with Holly Willoughby's way out of the 11 million-pound deal she was planning to make with Lifestyle Brand Peter, but instead she chose new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was compared to Goop's actresses, Guinea Peltrow.
The 37-year lead programme “This morning” announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand behind to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to Peter Jones' rage, star of the Logova Dragon.
According to our sources, Jones was “distorted” when a gymnast at a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckingemshire, admitted that she would not have enough time for their common brand of domestic clothing and Truly accessories after entering into new contracts.
Their brand was compared to a child actress, Guinean Peltrow brand Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double Willoughby's state of affairs, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old leader announced his departure in Instagram and Jones himself left Great Britain on a private plane towards one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to the footing of all participants in the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what had happened on Tuesday, because before the launch of the brand, there had been a number of weeks left.
The headquarters in Marlowe has a whole warehouse filled with ready-to-sale goods.”
Experts believe that one of Britain's most popular stars, one of the leading “This morning”, could cost the company millions of pounds of sterling due to considerable investment in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in starting the line.
In addition, it is a breach of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kepp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly's brand with Tara Kepp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples often spend their vacation together, and Jones also owns 40% of the firm's shares in Dan Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will be the Ambassador of the brand M&S and will replace Anthony McPartlin as the lead broadcast of ITV "I am a celebrity".
A source from the vicinity of Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his business affairs."
Complex negotiations, “and then we love each other”
He joked about the criticism with which the media violated him because of the “unworthy President” of the commentary and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse such claims?
Says Trump, imitating the lead news.
“I have not renounced anything.”
He noted that Kim Chen-Yun was interested in the reunion after Trump named their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Lee Young Ho addressed world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday, stating that North Korea was still awaiting “corresponding responses” from the United States following the initial DPRK disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, according to a diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“With North Korea, it will be wonderful,” he said. “
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen-Yun have resulted in an end to the missile tests, the hostages were released, and the United States soldiers who remained in the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Chen-yun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“It would be easy for the President to know, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street breaking into this completely hit hall, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Disasters recorded, victims calculated by hundreds
In the early days following the earthquake that struck Lombok, the NGOs told foreign NGOs that they were not in need of assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had lost their roofs above their heads, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team for departure in Palo, but we do not know yet whether the foreign team can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for Natural Disaster Management, the leadership of Indonesia is assessing the situation in Palo to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains badly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they can rarely be found on other shorelines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, there was no siren in Palo to warn the population, which most likely led to so many casualties.
The transport between the many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palo, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made Indonesia ' s veto infrastructure a major point in his electoral campaign and spent inconvenient funds on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko's administration, which is running for a new term next year, has made funding problems worse.
The President is also criticized for increasing the interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more were deprived of blood as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other crossbows.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score to a match against Chelsea goal in the far top corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from the 89th minute defeat of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Gerdan Shakiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea Gate, when his team played 1-0.
He moved to the left and pierced into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and felt at the far top of the net.
Golicoper Kepa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with the LiverpoolFC.com website, Starridge said, “It was all about being in that position and getting the ball, players like Shak always play the most on the attack, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw Kantah coming to me, and I took the sword, and I broke through the gates for a while.”
As a result of the first half of the match, Chelsea led with a score of 1-0, and the goal of 25 minutes was killed by Belgian Edin Azar.
Central Attacker Chelsea passed the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, and halfway through the field broke into half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played a single touch.
He then passed the pass to Azara, who had come out of the gate.
Azar was adjuvant with protection, and from the left flank struck the Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, striking the far angle of the net.
Liverpool will meet with the Napoli team at the championship league team stage. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will play with the videoton club at the UEFA Euroliga match, which will be held in London on Thursday, at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian Tsunami increased to 8,32
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed in Indonesia reached 832, the National Disaster Management Authority reported on Sunday morning.
Under the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, the earthquake was reported to have caused tsunamis of up to 6 metres high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the official representative of the Office during the press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was wrecked by the wrecked houses.

The monument to Cromwell in front of the Parliament building sparked a heated debate on “rewriting history”
The expulsion of Cromwell would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the numerous cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society referred to Mr. Creek's proposal as “the disaster” and “the attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconocortic movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of the authorship of Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell as the defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case of monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by professionals.
But it can be argued with confidence that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century had affected our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of the section.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve great appreciation and respect.”
A Chinese farmer killed a killer pig
At one of the markets in south-west China, a farmer was a pig victim, local media reported.
The bloody body of the victim (only mentioned in the media is his last name, Yuan), with a ruptured artery, was found near the bread market in Lupanshui province of Guizhou, South China, as reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
Pigsucker is preparing to introduce vaccinations to pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005, Sinin County of Qinghai Province of China.
Juan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Juan’s breathless body, and a door to a nearby pigsty was opened.
There was a huge heifer in the pigsty with blood on the rim.
During the forensic examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms [250 kg] bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bloodied and combed, ” explained the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated in a separate investigation squad to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer ' s death.
Pig attacks are not common.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, seriously traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal lured a Valiant peasant into a tractor and released him, only to fear a woman who had been burned to death.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon U.S. state was eaten by his own pigs, as a Canadian farmer described in the CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as “a launch mechanism”.
"The pigs are playful,
They are tasteful and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You should simply instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to much of the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to lose power as it moves through a more cool water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days it will bring torrential rains and floods to northern Mexico and south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached its 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, which is 360 km south-west of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Hurricanes are expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States, approaching the coast of Lower California, bringing tropical humidity north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days in the South-West, heavy rains are expected to occur as a result of the tropical humidity that hit the emerging low pressure zone.
Dilutions from 2.5 cm to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainwaters, contaminants and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air humidity, precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the south-west of the United States, largely in most of Arizona, it is expected that up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains shall not be excluded.
At the current risk of a tropical rainstorm, pedestrians in the desert have serious consequences.
The lions can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and lightning can cause violent winds and dust clouds to rise.
As a low-pressure zone emerges, the waters of the South California coast will be flooded.
Perhaps a drop of up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small contaminants and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
It's the first rainfall since the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and mornings in Arizona, the rains will be tropical, spreading to other territories by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rainy season will pass in the four corners area and will be extended until the evening of the Wednesday.
In October, there will be a sharp temperature surge throughout the U.S. territory, due to low air temperature in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most central and eastern United States territories, the weather is expected to be warm in early October and the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the area from the South Plains to the North-East.
In New York City, air temperature can rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid - October.
Senate hearings in the Brett Kavanaugh case have seen more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christina Blazi Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of more than 20 million viewers on Thursday.
The political opposition over Kavano's claim was a surprise follow-up. On Friday, an urgent message was received from the media: Republican Jeff Flake proposed that charges against a lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she is confident that Kavanaugh was intoxicated and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh made emotional statements, claiming that 100 per cent were confident that this was not the case.
According to the Nielsen research agency, Friday’s debates saw more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen’s ratings do not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
By comparison, this is the average audience watching the American football match in the playoffs or the Oscar award ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose leading hot support for Kavanaugh's appointment: Senate hearings that lasted the whole day averaged 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Second, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reported.
After hearings, interest in the case did not wane.
On Friday, a real drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After a moderate republican senator from Arizona reported his intention to support Kavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS TV channels managed to seal the cell, as on Friday morning on the way to the Flake Legal Committee meeting in the elevator with a group of activists criticizing the senator.
The whole world saw him drop his eyes and get a bang from angry women on CNN.
"I am standing before you," one of them said.
“Do you think he is telling the country the truth?”
“For you the strength, while so many women are powerless”, they tried to explain their position to the woman.
Flake told activists that his office had already prepared a statement, and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from all the cameras.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh's nomination for a judge and to send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast a live broadcast.
However, Flake made one condition — to investigate the FBI on these charges against the candidate by next week, as a democratic minority had done.
Flake claims he's changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats of Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision took effect, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump's order opened an investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" over the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting the narrow party interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister is arriving at a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published in one section of May's interview, former head of MID, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Shashki plan in Brexita, claiming that she believed the introduction of customs duties between Great Britain and the EU was “absolutely ridiculous”.
Wade Sims' death in a shootout: LAPD arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of murdering the University of Louisiana forvard
Police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Diane Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
The police released a video of a fight involving Simms and Simpson in which Simms lost his points.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the spot found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to the Advocate publication, Simpson has a $350,000 deposit.
The mayor of the eastern district of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary opinion on Friday: death was caused by a combined neck and head gunshot.
The Division thanks the Department of Criminal Investigation of Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents for assisting in the investigation and investigation activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good faith in the identity of the offender”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
Two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne was also a member of the Louisiana State University team.
In the past season, Simms scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices on average for a match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death had caused shock and the real woe for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” added the coach.
Volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
The volcano Popocatepetl fell asleep in the ashes of the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population stay away from the volcano, with 183 levels recorded in its crater.
According to the Centre’s observations, there was often commotion and a sense of irritability near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social network users have published photographs of frontal glazing of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes.
After the 7.1 Mw earthquake of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded increased volcanic activity in 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, in Barcelona, a multi-thousand rally was held on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps, without clashes between the supporters of autonomy and the police; six members of the riots were detained.
Police officers pushed out protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw away detentions with eggs and powder paint, raising clouds of dark dust in the very centre of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police launched a crowd-restraint.
For several hours, the supporters of independence chanted, “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” and their opponents replied with the slogan, “Give health to Spain!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were admitted to a hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain was held, and it was recognized as an illegal Spanish Government, but it was an important milestone for separatists. A year later, tension persisted in the region ' s quest for sovereignty.
Catalonia voted in favour of leaving Spain with a huge overcrowding, but the phenomenon was low because the opponents of the exit were mostly boycotted by a referendum.
According to Catalonian official sources, in an attempt to block a referendum on the country ' s polls last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists spent the night on the declared road to a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it.
The demonstration still took place, but it took a different route.
A 68-year-old electrician, Narcisse Termes, who attended a separatist rally in his wife's company, suggested that the hope of acquiring sovereignty by Catalonia was becoming more and more chilly.
"Last year, there was one of the most important events in our life.
My parents wept for happiness, given the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in suspended condition," he said.
In the recent December elections to local governments, the Catalonian parties in favour of the separation from Spain received a significant victory, even with a small break, but this year their movement loses its supporters because many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police-support rally, said that the conflict was heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
"The tension is growing," he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, from the end of last year ' s pretrial detention cell, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in regular elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and reprisals by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the homes in Londonberry had been beaten several times by a car; the men in London were arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39.
The raid took place on Thursday, around 7:30 a.m. local time in the Ballinogard Kresent area.
The taran caused damage to the gate and the building itself, according to Criminal Police Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that a shot could have been fired from the bow in the car.
Livingstone victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's bullet goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingstone team
Because of the battle killed, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the Scottish Club's head coach, Stephen Gerard, it was only a second defeat for 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's exact hit leveled Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian Club in the starting table where they split the second place.
The Gerrard Club was undefeated during the season of the Premier League, meeting with group leaders, Harts, eight points behind Rangers on Sunday.
On Thursday, Rangers will hold a match of the League of Europe with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingston Club continues its gameless series in the division, playing six matches, and has not received any defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's chief coach.
Missed points for Livingstone in the fight against violent guests
Top coach Holt had to keep an account from the start — the Rangers clearly failed to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt didn't come out, and then defense attorney Alan Litgoe, swinging too wide, couldn't stop Kaeg Halkett's ball from getting into the net.
The host has allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on the dangerous moments of the game's resumption.
That's exactly how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers took a free shot and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity that Declan Gallagher and Robinson passed over to Menge, who had killed him in the central position.
By then, Rangers had the advantage of owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was impenetrable, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time went on the same pattern, although Kelly still had to take a hit from Alfredo Morelos.
Doorman Rangers Allan McGregor took the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgo made a big tip out of the standard position.
The balls were constantly caught in Livingstone's fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalty demands — one for triggering Glenn Middleton Halkett's spare player and the other for playing the hand — were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, coverage with Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the players were magnificent and once again exceeded all expectations by continuing to climb the Olympics.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged since they got back to the top of the ranking, and a great deal of credit has been given to Coach Holt for mobilizing this team from the very beginning.
His team had a lot of real heroes.
Captain Halkett ran an excellently organized defense, and Menga refused to let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
The Rangers could not get into the rhythm.
Although they had a good playtime with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last few minutes, the match was not enough to hold the ball, but only once did they have the protection of the host team. The Rangers, who fell into the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdogan's cool reception during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, there was a great weather, and both of the top people were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries — a visit that already involved some conflicts.
The Heads of State have not been able to understand issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony of a great new mosque.
Cologne has the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousand crowd to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdo-Ghan lay near to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, also gathered to condemn in full both the Erdrogan policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to Germany.
The existence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguity of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
A car accident on Deptford's roads: collision with the car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the vehicle encountered a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident took place near Bestod Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossroads in the south-eastern part of the city of Depfort, at approximately 10:15 local time.
The driver and the ambulance were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died without consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: only a mile and a half from the accident site, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a motor vehicle whose driver had disappeared.
The London Police report that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and inform his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roadblocks and bus routes have been blocked at the scene: motorists are asked not to go to the area.
The riots in Long Lartin prison: six police officers wounded
According to the Long Lartin Administration, six police officers were injured during the riots committed in the men ' s prison.
The men's prison of the strict Long Lartin (Wistershire) has been in a riot since Sunday, which has been closed down around 9:30 a.m. local time.
An operation called Tornado was launched to suppress riots involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
The police suffered minor damage to the soft tissue of the person; they were provided with medical care on the spot.
According to the official prison representative, “specially trained staff have been recruited to resolve the incident at Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We will categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and that their measures of repression may be changed for a longer period.”
More than 500 prisoners are currently held in Long-Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized by one of the prisoners.
And last October, the prison leadership was forced to bring in special-purpose units to calm the dissipated prisoners who threw pool balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the zone of intense tropical cyclones, but this time it is lucky: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, the last branch, must pass over the desert area of South-West and carry the risk of torrential floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of floods on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and will be poured out on Monday night.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported in Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 320 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, a total of 15 cm on the Arison Mogolon-Rim plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Rockies and the Great Bassain, it is possible to land up to 2.5 cm to 5 cm of precipitation, with a rainfall of up to 10 cm.
For areas where the torrential tides will pass, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, for the region has long been suffering from drought.
Although torrential floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not pass in the South-West of the United States.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of Arizona territory has at least severe droughts (the second heavyweight),” reports the weather.com website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, with a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane was found in a water-cooler zone on the Pacific coast, thus losing its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico it is expected that there will be plenty of floods at risk.
“In the territory from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, it may fall to 7–10 cm of precipitation, up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Then Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico's territory, and on Tuesday morning, she will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclones, from Arizona to the southern part of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the heavy tides in Lower California, north-west Sonora and the desert areas south-west of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
Landfalls are expected to cause dangerous rainwaters, pollution in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects detained in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy received severe knife wounds, suspected of murdering three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy.
The victim was found in the area of Axelsior Terras, Midsomer Norton, about four o’clock Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects between 17, 18 and 20 years of age were arrested in the Radstock area, reports Avon County and Somerset.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime with any video of what happened on the cell phone.
Donald Trump: "In Kavanaugh, all the hatred, all the malice of the Democrats has been broken"
“The vote behind Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his associates in Wilinga, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the Kavanaugh nomination process, “all hatred, all malice,” of the Democratic Party, has been overtaken.
On Thursday, Kavano testified at the U.S. Congress in his emotional appeal by categorically rejecting Christina Blazi Ford's accusation that he was sexually pursuing her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in favour of the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unsettled public service list”, said the president to a crowd of his associates in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the issue of Kavano's nomination, referring to the importance of the republican election to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“Until the most important elections in our lives, only five weeks remain.
I do not participate in them, but I do participate in a race in a different sense," he said.
“I wear like a burnt-out and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting us in every way”.
For the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate for the approval of Kawano candidature should take place no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republic Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, and many were abducted by giant waves that captured the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which was hit by the incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in Palo, where waves reached a height of about six metres on Friday, which led to the immediate death of many of the present.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of running away immediately, and lost their lives as a result of it,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“Tsuns were not one, there were cars, logs, whole houses, and elements that destroyed everything in their path,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had hit the coast with all its power.
Some of those present came to the trees, saving their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palo.
The aerial survey of disaster management shows destroyed houses, shops, destroyed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still rocked by underground pushes.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy emissions caused by the earthquake were about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected from the geographical position of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “large”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the ruins of the destroyed buildings; 540 were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destruction could be even larger along the coast 300 km from Palo, in the Dungal area, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communications from Dungala were “completely destroyed, no information was received”.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the Dungal area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a limit,” the communication said.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the tsunami in Palo, but authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in effect.
A social media video appeared in which a man on the upper floor of the building screams about the upcoming tsunami, desperately trying to attract people to the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water will be broken down, carrying all the houses and cars.
The authorship of this video has not yet been confirmed by Reuters.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have resulted in massive power losses, causing communications to disappear in Palo, making rescue operations very difficult.
From Jakarta and other cities military transport aircraft were dispatched with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacked food and essential items, government sources reported.
The airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a bad situation.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungala to Pala, where the staff found shelter in the tarpaulin tents broken up in the yard of their office building.
“They saw a great many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a bad situation.
Charity organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to reach Palo.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the disaster zone has been declared.
That's not what happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariani, Spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a national disaster, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but for now the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the people who had disappeared still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will bring the people back to the best.
A little boy fell into a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue workers pulled out of the wreckage of the building a woman who spent two days there with her mother's breathless body.
Hendon Subando, a coach of Indonesia ' s national paraplaneism team, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped at the Roo Roe Hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s hard to survive emotionally,” he said.
He remembers how, after learning about the collapse of Roo Roe's hotel from other paraplanes, over the next hours, he was desperate to contact whatsapp with his pals from Pal who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were depicted with one gray branch, not two doves.
“This means that the communications were not delivered”, he said.
Stupendous theft of $26,750 during maintenance of an ATM machine in Newporton Livi
On Friday morning, the criminals stole $26,750 from the Brink's Incasator, one of the ATMs in Newport on Livi, says the Newport police press release.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of a armored microbus was picking up cash from an ATM located in an entertainment complex and was going to charge it with new bills.
At this time, “Brink's employee was run off his back by an intruder” and stole a banknote bag to charge an ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these persons are requested to contact the NYPD Police Department at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Yee
The rapper, Kanye West, came up with a new name: Yee.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: “The person formerly known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old West has long been wearing this alias and even named it his eighth album, which was released in June.
News of this appeared in advance of Kanye's arrival at Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will act as cognizant instead of Ariana, who cancelled her participation because of “emotional experiences”, the author reports.
West had previously stated that the alias was not only a reduced version of his name but also a religious meaning.
“Yes — the most common word in the Bible — it means “you, ” “you,” West explained the name of his album in one of the recent Big Boy radio interviews.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first I was Kanye, which means “one, ” and now I am just Ye, that is, a reflection of everything good, bad, misunderstood in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or simply Diddy, asked this year to name himself Love or Braza Love.
Westo's rapper J.Z. also changed his name a few times: with and without letters, letters, or sentences.
President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military forces against civilians
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador never swore to resort to military force against the civilian population on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, President López Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration, the students were given their first shots at the crowd and the massacre began, killing 300 people, as a result of the increase in left student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship to study and open up more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects have led young people into a criminal world.
The funding for development of II should be doubled.
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence (II) — the United States should double its investments in its scientific developments, Li Caifu, investor and entrepreneur in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several American ministries had previously made statements on work on II, although in general the United States did not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China submitted its own plan last year: its objective is to become the first in the 2030 innovations.
“A double increase in the budget for research in II would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in IFI,” says Lee.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be made in the United States, said Li CNBC in an interview this week.
Li, whose book entitled “Super-Powers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a system of artificial intelligence that surpassed the highest player in the U.S. Otello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Li mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Li is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in the same way as the National Science Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is below, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence had established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with partners from industry and academia, and the White House had announced the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced investing $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research by II.
In the meantime, US legislation, which has sought to establish the National Safety Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, allowing the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a proposal for a new title, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs in Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter appearance would correspond to a minimum of 50 per cent for the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of title would require a two-thirds majority vote of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, the elector of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, placing chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our heads high, not to overwhelm the thresholds of the cabinets,” said Kavadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was much needed by the country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the guarantee of our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this was lower than the required exercise.
Another interview conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this amount is claimed to be positive.
For the referendum to take place, the event must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policies of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes around protecting Brighton to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling argued with Brighton's protection, bringing Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Teehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal of 65 minutes, it seemed to him that it was nothing to do with him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport in the center of the field.
He ran between the three Brighton defenders before breaking out into the open space.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He circled one of the defenders and rounded up several more along the Brighton Penalty Zone.
He then passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English attacker in the penalty zone returned the Aguero ball to the right foot and pierced the Brighton doorman, Matthew Ryan, into the right corner.
“Aguero is having some problems with his legs,” said Manchester City trainer Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he struck a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky an initial advantage in the fight against the Premier League.
That goal was scored for 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero received a ball deep inside Brighton
He gave a great cut on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sanne made a few cuts before giving Sterling the long-distance stand.
The Attacker of the Blue Sky threw a ball at the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City met with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions group on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. on the Rhine-Neckar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer's going to take his points off of Colorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nationals broke out of the battle for playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Scherzer hopes to take over against Colorado Rokis on Sunday, but only if the Rokis play ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division will the issue begin in playoffs.
By winning 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, Rokis has won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to win the title in the first division.
“Although we are playing just that, but at least we can hold positions, knowing the great significance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?"
Nashionals has not yet announced the pitcher on Sunday, but, according to the latest figures, in the present situation, sherzer is inclined to play this role.
Scherzer, who's going to play his 34th game, threw his ball at the pitcher pad on Thursday, and he's going to be a pitcher on Sunday.

Trump holds the West Virginia electoral race
Referring to the importance of republicans in the interim elections, the President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, a candidate nominated by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is very, very important. I am not running, although I am really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means necessary, and we are watching the despicable and repugnant.
They don't care who they insult, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want -- power and control, but we're not going to give them back to them."
The Democrats, he claims, have set the goal of “resisting and obstructing”.
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, perverse and false”.
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to Senator Diane Finestein, who made a loud voice out of the room.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the content of this document to be leaked?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the tongue of the body has betrayed her, I have never seen the language of the body contradict the words so much.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not show tolerance for those who express their views
When the Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
In the end, I am the last in a number of members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who have not yet been told that we are not welcome for what we say.
The same attitude toward my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, mistrust was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, ironically, are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight-year term as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party was that.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in keeping with many meetings, and the promise of “more human and soft” policies has long been forgotten if it ever was.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Labour Party is becoming more and more apparent, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to mine began to expect that I would radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with — whether national security issues or the EU single market.
Every time I make a public statement — not to mention what I am saying — there should be a series of insults on social networks calling for the abolition of elections condemning the centre's policy or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face the flow of attacks on sexual or racist soil every day, but never retreat.
The biggest disappointment in this policy is the fact that such an amount of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with each vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party is already becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling me to sit quietly and to speak less, and then I will be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a student of the school, outraged by the contemptuous attitude of the Government of Thatcher, which led my school class to literally break up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether the work of a local MP or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, I didn't do it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which will be assuredly responsible for economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that no threat of lifting the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament of Nottingham East
R 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Air comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but, no doubt, Er deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match between the Tennet League.
They are now leading the table, the only undefeated team of tens.
Finally, all thanks to their excellent protection and the ability to choose the right moment, which gave host team and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” Peter Merci commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's about to pay tribute to the Air, they've done better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Fraser Klimo, brought Er forward, but the yellow card released for the Vorios game by Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased the term “Er” from a fine before, right in the middle of the game, scored a point, and then in the break he made a solitary attempt by making an account of 17-5 in favour of “Er”.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt at Baggott reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruard Knott, who was strained, and after his re-entry, Air moved further due to the attempt by Stafford McDowell, realized by Klimo.
Acting Captain Air Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose was again forced to pay the rivals for another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
Nevertheless, the masters returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received the yellow card to intercept Klimo without the ball from the penalty line, McFherson made a touchdown behind the incoming mole of Air.
The climate realized the advantage without stopping almost from the very exit, after Kyle Roe was struck by David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's extreme attacker to the fifth attempt at mastering the field.
Still Game Star is about to start a new career in restaurant business
Star Still Game Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hospitality industry: he was known to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a script he writes to, and is filmed along with his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemfill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last on the show, and Kiernan seemed to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to take part in the “a thriving restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our seas”: Bolivia hopes to find its way back to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the La Paz naval headquarters.
Blue flags are hanging on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with a slogan: "Ours are right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia without access to the sea, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost in Chile's favor as a result of the 19th century's bloody conflict because of resources; the living and desire to travel back to the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the bravest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision to be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and mental balance, and, of course, there is a positive outcome there,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is struggling to re-election next year, is also anxious to see a decision delivered Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, that will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to rule the Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the latest arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complex”, says Pas Zarat, Chilean International Law Expert.
For the past four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, but it has been postponed all the time.
“The current administration of Bolivia has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” says Zarat.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court decision had been rendered too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Kalzadilla also disagrees that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political player.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he argues.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to see once again that we must strike through our past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not continue until it is able to trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, declares that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it fails to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the pledges made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of the resumption of blunt nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Yin.
Rie claims: The dream that long sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But the skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of the arsenal, which the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive major outfits that promise to show up in the mass sale and carry them right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headwear, which is part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snooty works to the podium.
A different piece of Valentino: the main beige outfit, decorated with wide fields of feathers, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jeweled orbstones, wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all these main suits are not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared to the world as a collection of miraculous masks, which had to be very important before Halloween.
Many of these petals had their mouths sewn on, and they resembled Hannibal Lector's portrait more than that of a box.
One of the copies reminded us of the equipment used for underwater navigation with tube and protective glasses, and the other with the melting ice cream.
If you're a big fan of fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into a mass sale — directly to you.
The helmets of great size go on the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot straw hat that was already worn by everyone from Ryanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which won such wide popularity in social networks, gave birth to and sent out to walk on the podium another huge accessory — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the bathing suit itself.
The orange bag of the roasted Rafia with a white leather handle and a riviera cap from the Rafi became a bright copy of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Selebritist Luke Armitage relates the publication FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale the following summer, because the designer made such furor with his works, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue with the tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other important disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and are seeking to provide a higher level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their careers and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector responsible for developing and implementing an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, you will turn to his heart."
This is a convincing testimony that we cannot rely solely on English if we are to build relations with and trust citizens of other countries.
As a result of the last exams this year, we see that languages take the lead in the league tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest rating of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils received A in Mandarin (in Chinese) while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish also received A.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now being used in the same way as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent school curricula and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for employers ' difficulties in filling vacant jobs had resulted in a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming a prerequisite for a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by acquiring another additional skill that will benefit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitive advantages.
According to a survey by YouGov involving over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well enough in foreign language to support the conversation, while French was the only language with a two-pronged percentage of respondents said 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Learning several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
Schools in Scotland have quite a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools are concentrated in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the light of the country's future development by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice from several languages with a teaching staff, whose members are experts in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create a school environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the global business environment in terms of the future development of the country, so this should be reflected accordingly in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice of diversity and advantages for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The emotional expectation of fans to see LeBron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers has almost ended.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the pre-season Sunday match against Denver Naggetts in San Diego.
But it is still necessary to determine how long it will have to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight”, said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Truell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on Lakers.
“At this stage, I do not need my career in pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the player replied.
Trump electoral race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the nomination he had proposed for a Supreme Judge had been postponed, Trump sought support in the upcoming interim elections, for the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote was to take place in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00. Eastern time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting with Western Virginia voters online on direct YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings that will take place this week in order to appoint his candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, to serve as High Judge, and Trump's proposal has caused a lot of negative responses, as Kavanaugh has been charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a period of up to a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the November elections to increase the electoral pace.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at enabling these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, “to activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important to its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, as we are entering a tense season of election agitation,” Reuters reported.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling may attract supporters from “Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, ” reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to Trump West Virginia on this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, as it is here that it has received an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is behind the polls.
“This is a bad sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (the Reuters citation).
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Assembly shows willingness to fight and hopes on Sunday for couples competitions
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday's game was two-by-two probably exactly what Ryder's Cube needed.
The emerging initiative is an extremely elaborate sports concept, but it is the player who believes it, and it is particularly prominent in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spit while going away.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage and another twelve on the horse.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the wind in the sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit high, not least thanks to the form of Spit and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and everyone can boast of three points of four.
The sleep was unfavorable from you to the Green before setting a personal example.
The victory bells grew louder as his round continued, throwing a decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when Thomas and I stepped back two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory at the 15th hole, was met by a similar adage, one of what they say about his faith in the chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus only on our game,” said Spit.
That's all that's left for the players right now.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of Cup Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked four out of the four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't recruit a god on Saturday day, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday day, and again Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the impersonal ills strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player that has strengthened Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both of them were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio García, the morning hero of the game in four games when he was with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two double gods on the first nine holes dug a Spanish man and a Swedish manhole from which they could never get out.
So no one will help you get out of your pit on Sunday.
It is so exciting to watch the game in four games and four players because of the interaction between couples, the councils that they exchange, and which are deliberately silent, and how a strategy can change into one moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and it has far gone forward on the last day, but this session of the Quartet has also shown that the U.S. assembly has all the strength to fight in which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day, the Ryder Cup of Europe is in charge of 10-6.
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of Kuba Ryder after the completion of Saturday matches in four games and fours with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National account to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team's mistake in four games in the morning, winning 3-1.
The United States has increased its resistance in the Quartet by winning two matches, but they have not been able to narrow the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, who were named "Mollywood" after the sensational weekends, became only the second pair, who won four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubk Ryder.
By smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four games, they were then wonderfully united to win over the fallen spirit of Woods and US newcomer Brayson Decebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who spent two Saturdays, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four and four in seven in seven.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the four - ball game in the morning, returned to Henry Stanson's partner on Thursday, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke with a 2/1 account of first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk from Paris on a refreshing day south-west.
earned by three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points served as a guide for the Americans.
They won a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in four games and returned later to play with Polter and Rory McElroy with 4/3 on Thursdays, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kuba Ryder, the team had to leave behind at four points, leaving alone, given that the Ferik team, as the masters, had to play with a touchdown to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their reach.
North Korea says that “categically” will not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions were increasing distrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear range and the obligation not to build up nuclear weapons and to develop nuclear technologies.
“We do not see a symmetrical reaction from the United States, however,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally take action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the already resounding North Korean complaints of resistance to Washington's “stepping” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as was done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Inom and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “denocularization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised North Korean security assurances.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for the weakening of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “the denuclearization must be done first,” and raises pressure through sanctions to force its purpose and even oppose “the declaration of the end of the war,” says Ri.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions exacerbate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the United States leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, “If South Korea were a party to this issue of denuclearization, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a impasse.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim “the suicide bomber”.
This year, at UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not indicate any time limits for the process: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to halt the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the United Nations Genasembly Kuwali and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, said that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandittic demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, at a meeting with Moon this month, if the United States took “measures”.
According to Kim, he told him that “the appropriate measures” he spoke of were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to relax in special classes.
The new course introduced at Harvard University this year helped all students to learn more to sleep and to fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to wake up “nights in the spring”.
One of the academics found that the world’s most successful students often have no idea of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considered to be the first in the United States.
After its opening, he was keen to introduce such a course by giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I am very sorry that I learned about this only now that I am almost finishing my education.’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, ” said The Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting success, as well as how it improves the overall self-esteem of the individual.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it had been found that students were severely deprived of sleep during the training week.
The job lasts for an hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the course, an image of a dormitory room is offered, where students who press on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books receive information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light — affect sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these exercises do not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, like any other person, the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that the false sense of pride that a person can “sufficient all night” is still common enough, and modern technologies, just as increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
He said that enough good quality sleep is the “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, anxiety and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, as lack of sleep moves the brain to hunger, making him constantly feel hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop a course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to undergo a similar curriculum before entering a competitive training facility.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up an alarm clock to warn them that they should sleep and wake up, as well as to remember the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps that violate human biotytics and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins the Gerrard team
The Rangers survived another sad retreat, as the goal of Dolly Menga led the ungainly Steven Gerrard team to a 1-0 in Livingston.
The Aybroks team hoped to win their first victory in a victory after the 4-1 victory in February in St. John'ston, but the Garry Holt team only defeated Gerard from 18 games as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving a light victory to the Harts team, leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost the spirit, seemed not to be going to settle the score.
While Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to third place, and only Hibernian, by the ratio of the heads that were killed, withdrew.
The Rangers may also have additional problems after a line judge named Kaluma Spence had to heal his head wounds after some object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements for the team that went through Air in the semifinals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt followed Livi 11 with the same strategy, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-formed composition narrowed his opponents at every step.
Rangers may have ruled in the possession of the sword, but Livingstone was pushing far more when the ball came to them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes when Meng Scott Pittman's first transmission stopped Allan MacGregor, but the half-protector took the chance.
Kegan Jacobs fined Craig Halkett's captain, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to send the ball to the next stand.
Rangers have taken control, but in the last third, there seems to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident that he had to strike a penalty strike at forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Loules clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers only struck two times in the first time, but former Ibroxa goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Kulibali's blow to the head, and about this weak blow to Ovi Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livi, killed for 34 minutes, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserve it solely by their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson the ball, trying hard to hand the ball over to Menga to finish.
Gerrard started acting on a break when he changed the Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and that replacement almost immediately resulted when the ultimate half-protector gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran away from his intercept line.
But Livingstone continued to lure guests into the game they had planned with Litgo and Halkett, constantly making long transfers.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgo passed the field.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, again required a fine after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger
And now the page of our almanac "Resurrection Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the pillars of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the pillars of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film “Colocola Coronado, ” with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — as if unlike scientists — in the main roles:
Man: What kind of thing is that?
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earrings, you can actually hear the impact of atoms generated by mineral radioactivity.”
Evans: “Here, it’s heard!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see anomalies.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anomalous cells and kill them.
The part of the vaccine’s treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalies.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells have the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then the cells must be reintroduced
Test vaccines show promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who received this vaccine, and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalies, has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 protein characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Bethesda, Maryland, states: “The results we received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia, which included the removal of immune cells from patients and their “training”, how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanye West spoke in defense of Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance in the SNL.
It's all gone wrong.
Kanye West was educated in a studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke in defence of President Donald Trump, claiming that he would resume his post in 2020.
After performing his third song, “The City of the Ghost, ” which he performed, “Let's make America a Great Again”, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," the performer said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Cristina Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
On television, the crowd was not dismayed by West’s statement, but the video was uploaded to the social media by comicist Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this step.
West also complained to the audience that his hat was ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They're all over me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “And they also said that my position is not rigid.”
West continues: "Do you want to know that it is not cool, that you should put on a superman's cloak so that no one can tell you what to do, do you want the world to continue?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, members of the SNL actors seemed to be scattered, and one person said to the publication, “The whole studio is silent.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many puzzled Westom's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group head Kendis Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SPASIBO FOR THE SUPPORT OF MANY”.
The leading talk show, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity), who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
So do we," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dog, originally named Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, one can bring the performer who has recently become a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder due to divestment in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihamora, police reported.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Peace Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The Capital Games Star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow's swinging sword in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO Games of Thrones.
However, a 31-year-old actor has recently criticized the macho stereotype, saying that such characters often suggest that to be respected, young people must be cruel.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that he felt that “something had gone wrong” and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married a fellow on the Games of Thrones, Rose Leslie, admitted to being “indifferent to the problem. ”
“I personally take this question seriously: where have we been wrong with our sense of courage?” the actor asked.
“What do we teach teenagers that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television can be partly responsible for this outbreak of toxic courage due to too many muscular characters.
The actor continues: "What is born and what is acquired?
What do they teach on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel that they have to show just one particular aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today, with young people, something really is wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any blemishes or sieves of the Games of Thrones after the series ended next summer, stating that he had “end up with battalions and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in Sam Shepherd's re-recorded "True West" about the producer of the film and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best final of the Games of Thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life,” the actor said.
Rose was played by Igrist — the passion of Keith Jon Snow’s character in the fantasy series, which was awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who have HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, sexually transmitted diseases indicate a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health representatives at a conference in Yunnan Province said.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China ' s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men end up marrying women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to medicines against HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information about the leak of information on the guilt of senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A US Parliament member, Maxine Waters, on Saturday, rejected the charges that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the drafters' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that claims were falsified by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lying, lying, and even worse lies,” says Waters in his Twitter account.
It is reported that published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during hearings with the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Charges against the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identifies the source, was linked to the Waters office and made public information about Waters staff, Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures us.
“The members of my personnel, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions, were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unwarranted claim is a complete lie.”
Waters immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House Spokesperson Ari Fleisher.
“This is an angry denial,” says Fleisher.
“It means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something, what didn't you do, why be angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself either.
Nor should we dig into the motives of prosecutors.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleisher seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Kavano, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republic for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In her statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We make sure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again — the weak parody of Spy Rowen Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain is in one way or another; this is also true of the new parody spy franchise, Agent Johnny English, which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Overload".
Will a self-ironic painting with a "obviously we're all a piece of shit" for a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, profane Johnnie English’s pre-resin person had his right to chaos for the second time — his name most clearly suggests that he is a broad-screen comedy creature designed for a non - English cinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, received a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bin's features and a portion of this guy, who made one single note to the Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Initially, this character was based on the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, in which the hero left behind total chaos.
There is one or two pleasant moments in this latest issue of J.J.
I loved the scene when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the shovels crawled down his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially because “serious” cinematography such as “Agent 007” and “The Mission Is Unfulfilled” now offer comedy as an element.
The sense that humor is designed for children, not adults, and for me, the strange ills of Johnny Inglesh are not as creative and appropriate as Atkinson's trailers in Mr. Bin's films.
The permanent message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated the super-secret British network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an on-call agent named Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an epidural role.
It's the last drop for the Prime Minister, an overwhelming and aggressive figure who's already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can for the Quasi-Tereza-May character, but there's nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy was compromised, she would have to withdraw someone from retirement.
And here is Johnnie English's unscrupulous ring, who is now working as a school teacher in a pontificate institution, but also provides an informal lesson in secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of “year”.
English is returning to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with its former, unhappy friend, Buff, who is also played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the commander of the submarine, the role of the “joy hockey sticks”, in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's secret service made terrible mistakes, and they're facing a beautiful rock woman named Ophelia Bullet in the performance of Olga Curilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously enthralled by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems — the creepy Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Ingleish and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: masked by waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on Volt's luxury yacht; and English creates a complete anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality set to learn about Volt's interior.
All of these scenes are, of course, a sweet and embarrassing contraption, but there's something totally childish about it.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And, as with other Johnny Ingles films, I couldn't help but think, "Can't the British film industry give Rowen Atkinson a role that is really commensurate with his talent?"
Labour deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of British citizens to four days for a five-day salary.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, is planning to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company leaders to give the savings workers from the artificial intelligence revolution an extra weekend.
This would allow staff to enjoy a three-day weekend on the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “inscribed” on the party's economic agenda and would help the country's population to side with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
The highly placed source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the party's approach to changing labour balance in terms of the economy, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power out of the “noble directors” and “consumers” of utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current water canal shareholders may not get their share back, as the Labour Government may make a reading on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector capital to workers who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes," whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Justice for at least a week and has questioned whether the Agency's findings could prompt any senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, if the FBI can find anything to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“On my way to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and I came up with this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His response was decisive, determined and unequivocal.”
But Graham's vote remained inviolable.
“I have firmly defined Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to dynamite,” he said.
“Doctor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett strongly denied all this,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
I didn't see anything new in it."
What is Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York City — an annual musical event in which an impressive star formation with no less impressive mission — an end to poverty worldwide.
For the past seven years, as tens of thousands of people in the World Citizens' Festival have flocked to the great meadow of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, as well as to share the real purpose of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of World Citizens, which was opened in 2012, is a continuation of the global poverty reduction project being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket at the event (if you are not prepared to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteering or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12 - year celebration of the world’s citizens been in achieving their goal?
Is it the idea of paying people a free visit to the concert to truly persuade fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “klitivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing online petitions or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizens' organizers have stated that since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” have been recorded at the festival by its supporters, with many different goals.
It is recalled that as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group recorded 390 pledges and pledges made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds have been provided directly to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children to discover their full potential” promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the region's undernourishment, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can do social injustice with regard to the undernutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen organizers respond: “It will be a long and difficult road where we will occasionally stumble and fall.
But as in the great civil rights and apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Jeanelle Monnet are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York and will be led by Deborah Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
United States dollars may be used by the Navy to block Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
US Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could "help its Navy if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy in the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke contacted the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compared Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is a more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” says the Minister, calling Russia “a pony with one trick”, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump administration had set the task of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including United States President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” project of the Northern Stream-2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, Berlin made a “plenipot” Moscow pipeline.
In Moscow, it has been repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington ' s violent resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists from the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our supply of energy, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will carefully explore the possibility of voting for the presidency in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that she would carefully study the possibility of voting for the presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the city duma in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “pent” our broken government, and to do so “up top” needs a woman, ” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I shall consider carefully the possibility of voting with the Presidents.”
Warren appreciated the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “this district leads in the wrong direction”.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Cavanaugh.
In her Twitter tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Finally, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Centre for Political Studies of Saffolka/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of Democrats discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims to make an official decision by January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin described the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Paylin in a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump.
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, served in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same as other families who have suffered injuries and injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talls, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest “an opinion” and said of her son and other veterans of the war: “They are returning to others, crippled, asking whether the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military they have left their country”.
Trak Paylin was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against women by interfering with the situation of alcohol abuse and weapons storage, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasily Police Department.
18 states in Colombia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to the NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note Friday in Washington on the support of asylum-seekers challenging policies.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons in a criminal group”, had been ill-treated, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace suggest that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are applying for asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems of criminal factions and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed non-documented immigrants to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the district of Colombia, Karl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring decades of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the action and that such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court consultant stated in a communication.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting the entry of immigrants harm the economy of the United States, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sashns, ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sashns in his 11 June statement.
This instrument has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue people in Palo: the death toll is doubled in search of survivors
The situation was becoming more difficult for the survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35 - year - old Risa Kusum’s mother, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Each minute, the ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water is in a large deficit.”
Residents return to their ruined homes, dig in wet things, and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had a vertebral and shoulder fracture, rested near Palo’s army hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the room because of continued strong pushes.
He cries, remembering how a severe earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're saved and now they're fine.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “accused” by means of “advertising advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertisement in the United States daily, describing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the payment supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa City, charging China with an attempt to interfere with the election to the US Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the US elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have informed Reuters: a new phase is under way in Washington's growing pressure campaign against China.
While for foreign Governments it is the norm to place commercial advertisements, Beijing and Washington are now in a position to escalate the trade war, which makes them equal to the import tariffs of their countries.
China's responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to defeat exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic's Trump Party, by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, alleges that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and business.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this grass by posting advertising in our own free press”.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government enjoys the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying for and posting advertisements in Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“But in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissuasive voices and see the true diversity of views that Chinese people might be able to learn about China’s alarming economic policy, because local media are under strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers had “resurrectioned” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not give an exact title to the publication.
Analysts warn that Kavanaugh's dispersal of Republicans push women voters away before the interim period.
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative response, especially on the part of women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation have gone to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
Such things cannot be returned later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s attempts to investigate the FBI at the last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn to Washington, D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November ahead!" against the Senate, when the Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to put forward Kawano, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond," said a news site-free political scientist, Stu Rotenberg.
"People say the situation is already strong enough, and that is true.
But everything can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against a candidate for Supreme Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the move, this could trigger a response.
“It’s already a riot for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to the NBC News.
“It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavano has sat on the bench of the defendants, but also the way the Republicans deal with it,” says Guy Cecile, director of the U.S., a group that helps to elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have split up on whom to believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and are a little more inclined to the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe exactly or probably Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, whereas only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Fleeq, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, testified on the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Judge showed her her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open platform called Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview by Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt was to obtain “peace domination”.
“We have to do this now”, he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment”.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage sites” or SDs.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The app works in the same way as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – everything can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce's CEO, the idea was that the company had provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several established developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programming community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google whether his companies should make fundamental changes, which would make all their business models completely different.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Li's voice has been quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even the launch of Inrupt, Berners Li will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: church servant awarded Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglis and Luukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed four days later by a sniper, so he never realized that he had received the highest British military prize.
A monument to this event was solemnly opened to his two grandkids at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wang conducted his battalion through the St. Kanten Canal “in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself at the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led the group forward, and then with one hand, he threw a gun at the field and knocked down three troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that “he could hardly have done the same heroic thing, but it is soothing.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also wreathed after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
The MMA's didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they showed them Peppa's pig.
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see the complete Bellator 206, but you haven't been allowed to see the main event.
The San José Table contained 13 combats, including six main-program combats, broadcast all night live on 5 British television channels.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British were stunned when they saw Peppa Pig on screen.
Some sufferers were not impressed because they had not slept until morning precisely to see the battles.
One of the fans on Twitter called this a change in television broadcasts for a children's cartoon “some kind of sick joke”.
“It’s been a public order that this content is inappropriate for six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President Bellator for Marketing and Communications, when he was asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they were planning to set up a timetable in such a way that future battles could also be seen by British viewers.
“What matters is re-examination, I think we can resolve this issue,” says Koker.
“But there is a Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we cannot resolve this issue until Sunday after our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Trust me, when the message was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical malfunction.
It turned out not to be a matter of State importance.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that amount, but there's been a break.
Yes, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced a sense of inadequacy because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Diiver Tom Daly says that he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first programme of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that victory in the Olympics had become less disturbing after he had a child.
Kirsti Young's permanent longtime show took a few months off because of her illness.
Daily, the main guest of Laverna, said that he felt “more insignificant than any peer” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, "So far, these feelings of negligence and inadequacy have been quite real, but they have given me strength, and I have been successful."
He wanted to prove that he was “meaning something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learned about his sexual orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The world's three-time champion said that his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “were caught up with him. ”
Last year, Daly married an Oscar laureate who was 20 years older than him, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
“If there are so many things going on in your life at this young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer with the same fundamentally opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daley said that “all of his perceptions had changed. ”
“If you asked me last year, it would be all that ‘I need to win the gold medal’,” says the athlete.
“But you know that there are things and more important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept what he was dying, and one of his last requests was the first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you’ll be gone by then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’ says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” says the athlete.
Next year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life to dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, it was not the best thing,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, the Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and is still so fond of him.

Mikkelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday at the bench at Kubka Ryder
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Cup Ryder match, but he'll have to raise his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played the biennale for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürich to the bench on Saturday for four games and four.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five - time winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own playing field in hopes of correcting what concerns him.
Never having the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National rigid route, where a long shelf is usually punished for improper blows.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michelson will meet with the exact British Open Francesco Molinari on Sunday at the ninth match, which joined Tommy Flytwood's rookie to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 single games make a wild start, the Michelson match could be crucial.
Ferric expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, grabbed me on my back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferric commented.
"He is quite confident of himself.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michelson will beat Nick Foldo's match record in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven others, although Ferric said that his presence brought great benefits to the team.
“He is a funny, sarcastic, witty person, and he likes to have people with him, and he's a great guy who's interesting with them,” he explained.
"I think this week young players have had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has learned from experience that significant single-level leadership in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an unfavourable one.
The Dutchan debuted in a match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severjano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only slightly ahead of the lowest difference by winning the 141⁄2-131⁄2 bill.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far”, said Bjorn, captured in photography, after viewing the 2018 Class, winning the 5-3 box of Le Golf National, both on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be on full alert.
Go and do it right.
As long as the scoreboard is not on the table, nothing is yet.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said no silently, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that what we are up against is the greatest players in the world."
Happy with the way his players made themselves uncomfortable on their golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have gone too far in this.
We have another trial tomorrow.
Individual statements begin tomorrow, and this is a very different matter.
It's always nice to be around your partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you're experiencing all the strength of a professional golfer.
That is the idea that players need to have in mind in order to make themselves fully available tomorrow.
The partner now remains behind, and he must make every effort as well.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will speak better individually than their partners, except Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferrick himself went through all of the last days, becoming part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he finally lost, when Europe hosted the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had put his players together before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it as quickly as in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it exerts great pressure on the mid-point matches.
We built our game plan accordingly and set the kids up the way we thought they were right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McElroy at the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that they will cover all the shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The reintroduction of a new German warship
The new frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the cold war era, but this would not happen at least next year because of the faulty systems and the avalanche, local media reported.
The entry into operation of Rainland-Pfaltz, the main ship of completely new Baden-Württemberg frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, referring to a military representative.
The vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the naval fleet in 2007 will be replaced by the older frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful rifle, many air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some steel technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the newest frigates for up to two years away from the domestic ports.
Nevertheless, the constant delay in the entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are already getting old by the time they enter arms, notes Die Zeit.
The evil frigate F125 came into the headlines last year when the German naval fleet officially refused entry into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipowner after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made warships useless in fighting.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg would be operated by crews of about 120 sailors — only half the labour force in the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the IMF to introduce updates in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as those used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of retention on the anchors of the most recent frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the naval forces actually “completed the stockpile of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said that the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been removed but had not been replaced.
He was visiting that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be loaded with a fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouses
A new study carried out in one of the Scottish top sites is designed to show how flying mice use landscapes to find food.
It is to be hoped that the data received will allow a fresh look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and will assist in the continuation of species conservation.
A study organized by scientists at the Scottish National Foundation will examine the usual bats, the soprano bats, and the brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nightstands that inhabit the Inverew Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor the action of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using hand detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the screams, as well as the activities for which the various groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work for the management of the habitat, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forest habitats, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The population of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain has declined considerably in the last century.
They are at risk of disappearing because of construction and construction activities that affect their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger, also as duct tape for flies, chemical treatment of construction materials and domestic cat hunting.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using sophisticated echo technology to precisely identify obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
There are 10 trained experts who regularly conduct interviews, checkouts, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only reservation in Scotland for flying mice in the Threeave in Damfris and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Three, a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all elements of a good living environment.
But much about flying mice remains unknown, so the work that we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a good life.”
It recalls the importance of checking the presence of flying mice prior to maintenance within private property, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, grass or destruction of their places of residence is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, Scottish mouse conservation officer, appeals to the public for assistance.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we just don't know how many of them live."
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Kristian Ronaldo denies the rape charges against him, calling them "feek news", and claiming that people simply want to fight, using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spigel, which issued charges against the football player.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was charged with the rape of an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to talk about the incident, Spigel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a video in Instagram, where a football player has 142 million subscribers, hours after reporting charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information "feek news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fairy tales, says five times the winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
"They just want to fight with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, say my name, but it's only part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything I have is great," adds an athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Spigel for charges they have described as “unacceptable information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of a legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel Hotel in Las Vegas.
After getting acquainted with the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal fashion, according to documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent of a good guy, but he was one per cent flat.”
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but that was by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and the hospital took her injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear that she would be avenged” and feared “public humiliation”.
34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence as she continued to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was planning to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved on to the Italian Uwe giants in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “pity about car manufacturers lost forever”
Minister of Business and Enterprise Greg Clark said that Britain would “deploy this forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its position as world leader in the field of car production.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, not far from Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese auto-producer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The plant in Bernaston is made by Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it released almost 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain emerges from the EU in late March, production at our plant will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto-producers, the supply chain will be placed at high risk if there is no transaction under Brexit.
Toyota production line is launched “exactly” and the details for vehicles manufactured for purchase are delivered by suppliers of Britain and the EU every 37 minutes.
Should Britain withdraw from the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be gaps at the border that industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store its stock in Derbisher for more than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, sounding at Chekers, of future relations with the EU "has been calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We need a deal; we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, again, not only to succeed at present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on the air of BBC Radio 4 “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota had not been able to specify for what time period production would be suspended, but in the longer term it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsovallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory union, says that the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to recover them.”
The representative of the Government said, “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to White House information
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “removed for another week”, as the fight for Brett Kavano's candidacy for Supreme Justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If Trump dismissed the Deputy Attorney General from office, thereby endangering Muller's independence, there has been a lot of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of impeachment by the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “would not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate judicial committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, addressed Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, but perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court”.
But let us see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not conducted briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings was not caused by the “warning of the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing in public”.
She suggested increasing direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President is holding more meetings in response to journalists' questions than any other president before him,” she added, without adding, however, the exact figures: “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have had over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it is a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly responds to questions from the White House by attending open meetings or press conferences with high officials.
Conferences are rare for the press only.
Freestyle, and sometimes the odd conduct of the President in front of the journalists gathered this week in New York, may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland with a letter on the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in the Scottish GHS to express his gratitude for the country's name and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, an SME, addressed this letter to staff members less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the cost of issuing status applications for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit continued, and this autumn a expected decision must be made.
However, the British Government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, it is now my wish to reiterate my appreciation for the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie carried out an emergency head injury operation
Michael Organe from Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers' half-protector Christian Abercrombie carried on an emergency operation with head trauma on Saturday after 31-27 in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessy Rod Reed, head coach, told reporters that the trauma was sustained shortly before the break.
“He went to the side line and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen on the side line before placing it on the stretchers and carrying it on a medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the type/degree of injury are yet available”, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was only in his second year, it was the first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 ball in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher Herb fee when buying real estate in Britain.
According to the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher Herb fee for the purchase of real estate in Britain, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
This step will undo Corbin’s attempts to attract young voters
The increased herb fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year in favor of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher Herb fee in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless — this will be announced today by Teresa May.
This step will nullify Corbin ' s attempts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more accessible and raise citizens ' income.
The increase in herb charges would be imposed on individuals and non-tax firms in Britain, and the additional funds thus provided should encourage the Government ' s efforts to help homeless citizens.
The allowance for existing Herb collection, including the increase introduced two years ago to purchase secondary housing and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
Treasury expects this step to provide up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate is purchased by non-British residents, leading to price increases and making it difficult for buyers who acquire their first housing to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “dark cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country buying housing here.
A new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the herb congregation to help a greater number of young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of duplicating real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to waive the quotas for affordable housing in order to remedy the “disgusting housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and an end to unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: "Last year, I said that I had dedicated my Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
This includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, real estate is also available to hardworking British people.
For too many people, the desire to acquire their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to run Scotland”
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become the Scottish manager at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the revival of the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separated from the top three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's all," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching with my father behind Scotland in Hampden, and this has always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity would be possible only if I could become a successful manager of the club.”
The predecessors of Ross, Sunderland's managers were Dick's lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardeis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says that he has not experienced such authoritative names in such large clubs, having previously renounced Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
According to its structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," says the coach.
“To get him there is not an easy task, but I will think that I have done my job only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only worked for three years as the manager, becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts Training.
Then he helped Alloa to rise from the third level and in the next season moved St Mirren from lower positions to the winners of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real cross,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was better for me than a game.
That sounds weird, because I've done everything well, made a good living in this job, and made some progress.
But the game is harder.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at being the manager.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel more comfortable than the fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can have a full interview at Sportssound on Sunday, 30 September, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 1:00 a.m. to English summer time.
According to the survey, 5:30 — the perfect time for a pint of beer
Summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but it reduced sales in restaurant networks.
Statistics show that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting company that received this statistics, says: “Sun’s continued activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8% and in restaurants, vice versa, significantly reduced.”
The fall in restaurant income by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling liquor showed much higher results comparable to those in restaurants.
The pubs selling only food also suffered from the sun’s heat, although not as much as the restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out of the street just to miss a drink.
The sales of pubs and bars grew by 6.6 per cent per month and the food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain critical when it comes to non-existent market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the continuing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved more than ever to be for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will provide much-needed breathing.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the contraction of brands.
Sectoral sales monitoring of Coffer Peach Tracker for British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry reference.
Every fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents.
According to the survey, every fifth child — some of whom are only 11 years old — has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
20 000 high school students surveyed the growth of the Facebook Insto pages
This news has increased fears about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had the “core” account that parents know about.
However, every fifth child — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates accounts in social settings that he hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of Facebook insti accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about the content of sexual content.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally obtained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, stumbled upon a teenager who called on others to rape him.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles in social media, half of whom admitted that one was usually secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says: “Many adolescents seek to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact”.
Eilid Doyle will be the “vote of athletes” of Scotland's lightweight athlete
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's best-known athlete in athletics, and President Yen Bitty claims that this step is a great opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of the extensive international experience of athletes over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are confident that its participation will be of great benefit in Scotland,” says Bitti.
Doyle says, “I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a regular commentator at the BBC, after a transferred stroke losing his ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter account: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would make it right, and if so, to what extent.
It was a gruesome job, but I'm fully healed, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing a trick exercise today!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Milkootsos advertisements comparing nursing mothers to cows shared Internet user opinions
The dairy company sparked disputes on the Internet by publishing advertisements comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows.
As “the world’s first silent breast-bearing milkworm, ” the consumer technology company Elvie has published a commercial music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milkysoas gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a haystack under a music track that says, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
Then the choir: “We drain, drain, feed our babies with breast milk, drain, drain.”
This advertisement, which was posted on Facebook, sparked disputes on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed reaction from the viewers, many saying that it sheds light on the “wheats” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken from them within days of birth," one user writes.
Elvie molocoosos dress directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here is another comment: “It is clear that it is as traumatic for mothers as it is for children.
But why not use them to advertise milky sauce for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds: “Adverted from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, protected the roll, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just wonderful. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I fed the baby, I'd definitely buy one.
Breast - feeding really made me feel like a cow.
Ads are a little crazy, of course, but that's how they feel.
A genius product," one user wrote.
And another comment: “Mother-freaking commercials (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, in fact, feel a little "cow."
This advertisement is not to praise or mock our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetectable milkheads hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milkypox is absolutely insensitive, has no wires or pipes, is freely placed in the bra for feeding, and is undetectable, allowing women to move, hold young children and even go out on the street while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and child development specialist for Mother, comments: “Molocootsos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
We wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems while demonstrating a ludicrous and cheerful sense of freedom, which gives a new milk-othesis, as a parallel between women and dairy cows.
This is not the first time Elvie's milky sauce gets into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Jakubowski, using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved unhinderedly to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly crossings of the border has remained relatively constant, partly because the rigid rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate the children in the service.
Usually, most sponsors are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid of endangering their stay in the country, taking the child under the care of the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified at Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to be provided with care for minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously tried.
“Approximately 80 per cent of those who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
That is why we continue to prosecute these persons," said Olbens.
According to the shelter employees, in an effort to accelerate the process of child rearing, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be brought before the courts within a month after the detention, not 60 days earlier.
To declare its legal status to the immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are deemed to have no right to help will be promptly deported.
According to shelters and information workers who have appeared in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may result in violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that taking children to tent camps without having the time to prepare for it or to say good - bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Addressing the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war of the country for the eighth year.
Mual, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of counter-terrorism and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused “some Western countries” of spreading irrational insurance, which had caused refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until a political agreement on the cessation of war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major plot of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “a fixed time frame”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related fighters, who would “be destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will soon be convened, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the terms of participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “consideration of articles of the current constitution” and caution against interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
In line with this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal fail to complete his presidency prematurely, which is likely to be the case for many liberal viewers.
And this will no doubt be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
There is no sign of fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, Prime-Time ratings have increased more than twice — to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“It’s the fire that people are reaching out to because it’s beyond our understanding,” says Neil Barr, director of ABC’s “Delivered Survivor” drama, of a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skovall, a long-published comedian writer and author, “It’s so funny: several unpleasant truths about the entry into the Hollywood Boys Club” offer another theory.
She remembers riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, "Because it's funny!" said Mrs. Skovell.
In all this chaos, there is something of value — fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's news links can determine the future of Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of family reunification of immigrants and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, when you have been watching for six consecutive hours as a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's “deep background” for your book The Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 coat of ostrich skin (a garment that is immersed in pride), or the sharp description of Stormy Daniels, let's say, Mr. Trump's anatomy is already beyond ordinary knowledge.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“It’s often his work to make us feel that the reality of the show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars about the changing acting composition of Trump’s show and the daily twists of the plot (the fight with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Chen Y.).
You can't afford to miss any episodes, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flies this week, the northern coast of Kauai was 27 degrees warm, brightened by the sun, but he hid inside his home and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
It could not escape the screen, at least not when it showed how Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Legal Committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ says Mr. Flace.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outside money flows into the fiercest interim elections run by the White House
No wonder the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow from a change in districts in Congress where two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, which has not been changed recently, supports a Democrat, a member of the Conor Lemba House of Representatives, who took place in another district in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, a republican Kit Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is significantly in conflict with the new 17th.
The maps were reviewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old areas were assigned to Republicans in violation of the Constitution as a result of election fraud.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on funding campaigns between the party's financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lemba became known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special elections in Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the county, with 20 points of leverage.
Political experts give the Democrats little advantage.
United States dollars punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, which had caused Washington to react negatively.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and was also owned by Panama until the partners emigrated the Trump management team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the United States heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, said the press secretary of the Department of Heather Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country of Central America with its high unemployment and killings.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have taken place to take stock of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-ranking representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and had actually stopped considering the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be presented by Vice-President Mike Penz as a sign that the administration really attaches importance to this meeting.
The three American diplomatic representatives have successfully returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm a foreign analyst who is part of the administration, but also spoke in an anonymous manner.
Study History
The next step could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is currently very significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was also reportedly investigating the existence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia and its attacks in the past elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he is prepared to speak to the voters again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “if”; I do not wish to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and this has prevented the possibility of the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history is unfolding at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he proposed to make secret records of the President ' s activities and to discuss his inadmissibility for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein argued that the Times were incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is nevertheless approved as Supreme Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in favour of Congress in the medium term, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can go through them with the dignity of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman, sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who was once occupied by an ambassadorial house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she was driving me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With the family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic in the run-in with the Vienna Rapids Football Club.
The Rangers accept Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive victory in Spain over Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will enable them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe group.
The knee trauma prevented Graham Dorrans' half-protector for the first time in the season from going to anyone's account 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trample to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
“We went into the game, believing that we could get something, and left with no one.
Perhaps we could have done it eventually, but in general, no one was likely to have a fair outcome.
They probably played a better game in the first time, and our success came on the second time, where we proved to be better.
There will be another big European night this Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tricky game because they've shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the sufferers, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, given everything that was related to my injuries and the swaps at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is excellent, and the boys really enjoy it; the workouts took place on the hurrah.
I hope we can move forward, put the season behind us and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their retirement savings
Although the interviewers had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the value of long-term care.
However, only 10 per cent said that they had spoken to their children on the subject.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but do not try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide on Life Insurance.
And that's what we have to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they will likely have to do if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical treatment, since this choice can be an important factor in spending.
Consult your financial consultant: he will help you to develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by the traditional long-term care insurance policy or the mixed life insurance policy, which will help cover these expenses or self-insured through your own property, provided you have the money.
Get your legal papers in order: get rid of legal battalions.
Establish a medical authority and appoint a confidant who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that financial confidence-building be considered.
A trusted person should be selected to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small things: Imagine that your older parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on what medication he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on the paper in order to prepare properly in case of emergency.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have financial resources but also to select doctors”.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Draw up and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracomba, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle.
The man fired his pneumatic rifle several times, returning home from the revelry.
The victim, in the chest, the abdomen, and the arm of the bullet, was 40 years old, in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting that took place at approximately 2:30 a.m. English summer time as “a coincidence”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
As a result of communication, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the earthquake centre by 7.5 points.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pal and Donggal, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, is located at the end of the narrow cove on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district that stretches 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative district was smaller than the province, with 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the last 100 years, tsunamis have been destroyed several times in Palo and Donggal.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
Tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcano Ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The sequence of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the densest island of Indonesia, causing the tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 Magnitude earthquake took place in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the islands of Mentaway in Sumatra, causing tsunamis to reach 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and the tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in the destruction of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's Lombok tourist island, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice-President of Sarah Payne, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Pailin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the situation of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report a alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTOU, Peilin is in the Mat-Su Detention Unit and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “same innocence”.
Peilin is threatened with three minor A-class crimes, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payne, called the police, reporting an alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Court of Veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsification of the report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's harsh behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Murdered
At least 384 people were killed as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-ball earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications do not work, and in the coming days the number of victims will increase.
The earthquake took place not far from central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media shows videos of an accident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami struck the shore.
The Federal Procurator's office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspected terrorist in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, who has been suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which has resulted in the deaths of eight persons — a rare punishment for a federal offence that has not been committed in the State since 1953.
In October Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly took a rental truck to the Home Depot to attack a bicycle road on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, beating down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notification of the intention to achieve the death penalty imposed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty may be imposed on both charges.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was sentenced to 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “thoughtfully planned and deliberate”, Saip carried it out, it is described as being “disgusting, cruel and criminal”.
“Sifullo Habibullaevich Saip caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Lora Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernána Ferrucci, Hernánano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnekko,” says the intention notice.
Five were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty in the Southern District of New York for criminal offences.
In September 2009, accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time, the death penalty for the federal case in New York was imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s court documents, the native of Uzbekistan demonstrated a lack of remorse following his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the prosecution, Saip told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch a video of IGIL on the phone.
He also requested that the IGIL flag be hung in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denies his guilt over all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipo side, said that they were “clearly disappointed” with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision on the use of the death penalty, rather than on life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all their participants,” Patton said.
The defence of Saipowa had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Parliament member from Tori says that NAIJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Farage conference, he swore “to mobilize the people's army”.
Former leader Ukip said that politicians should “feel” of Eurosceptics, as one member of Parliament, Teresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the conservative party, Peter Bone, said at the Birmingham rally that Britain would have “come out” if Mr. Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that the Tori party against the EU joins a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan, which was sounded at Chekers in the midst of attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave to Survive in Solihall that he wanted to "encourage the Hammers".
He suggested that Mr. Farague should be leveled and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Deputy Wellingboro added, "I will continue to stand up for Brexit, but we have to play checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to remain completely was not true”.
Brixit from the Tori Andrea Jenkins party also attended a rally, giving journalists the comment, “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Chekers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote in favour of this plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and choosing us first.
Please put the Chekers aside and start listening to what you are told.”
In her strong appeal to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that if the policies were going to deliver the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be made to feel the need.
“This is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let it down for you."
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit, to feel impetuous.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of that country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved Tori v. Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, criticized conservatives because of security concerns in the mobile application of their party.
“And these people argue that they can set up Canada plus, IT systems and technologies for border work for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s one big farce.
Good Brexit does not exist in principle," he argues.
Warren plans to "examine" the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
A US Parliament member, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “examine the possibility of presidential balloting”.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told about her future at a rally meeting in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is being re-elected in November against a member of the Jeff Dil Republican Party, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has the chance to take up the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, in Holioca, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a council meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for the women to go to Washington to “behind” our broken government, and for that to be a woman upstairs”.
As a result of Sims' murder (occupied), LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of a basketball player named LSU Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department released a video of shooting to help identify the person who was able to film the video.
Simms, aged 20, was shot at a campus at South University on Friday morning.
“Waid Simms received a gunshot wound to the head resulting in his death”, police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to participating in the incident, carrying a weapon, and shooting at Wade Sims.
At the time of the arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The young man grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 startups last season, and gained 17.4 minutes on average, 5.6 points and 2.9 picks for the game.
Gran Pri Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Champion after commanding tactics gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Bottas had been trained on Saturday, after overcoming Lewis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mersedes' command tactics will play a major role in the race.
Bottas was already well on his way to Hamilton, when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton moaning in the tail of the entire group, a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to a stop one round later, and then went out behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, rushed forward, leading to the fact that the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the interior free, risking to stop after a double movement to protect himself on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from behind a series of nets and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
Then most of the race he ran, holding on the tires, to finish quickly, pushing Kim Rikkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he left for the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight circles, as Rikkonen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult because Walter did a fantastic job on weekends and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a few tricks in stock," said Hamilton.
Traitorized Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not publish a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct statement given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the Senate found that participants in those events were “disgusting, repulsive and false”.
“The only possible response to all of this and what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate is beautiful, it is anger, anger, filth and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I did not do it.
I did not do it.”
Remember?
Diane Finestein, did you "send" information?
Remember her answer... did you "send" information to the document? -- "what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Yeah, stop.
We, what did we say?...No, we didn't "salve," he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Fainstein sent a letter detailing the charges filed by Ford v. Cavanaugh, and in early September, it was illegally made public, but Fainstein denies that the leak took place in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not download her information,” said Fainstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of escape seemed to displease the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: the language of the body was very misleading.
She may not have “slapped”, but the language of the body was the worst I had ever seen.
As he continued to defend his candidate for the post of supreme judge, who had been accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President assumed that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They certainly try to regain power in all available ways.
We are watching despicable, disgusting, they don't care who they insult, who they have to step over to get power and control through," the Mediaite quoted the President as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duerer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 game Saturday in favour of Dundee.
The Giants gained an early advantage in two goals thanks to the strikes of Patrick Dueira and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duaire led the Jeants.
François Bushar compared the score of Dundee, before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen strengthened their victory.
For the people of Adam Kiff who won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, that was the third defeat in the elite league season.
Between the sides, it was the fourth meeting of the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
The first goal of Dueira was to arrive at the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's bare belt with David Rutherford's support, after which Boviler doubled his advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the masters to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt was able to balance the bill at 15:16.
Duaire confirmed that the Giants had taken over the initiative on the first break when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bushar re-aligned the account by shooting a goal at 27:37 p.m.
Coney and Charles Corcoran united to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity for the first time in a match to win leadership at the end of the second period, after which he and his team established a victory, by fighting rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five matches, are now heading to Milton Keyes for the next match to be held on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on board could avoid an earthquake.
The Indonesian air carrier was posthumously assigned to the title of the hero after he deliberately went to his death so that a plane with hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing as a result of a severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground pushes continue to destroy the area, and many residents of Palo’s city are under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the terrifying height of Mutiar Sis Al-Jufri Airport, Palou.
It remained in place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he felt that the roof was falling, he jumped off it.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation representative Johannes Sirait said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News Agency reported.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balipan, Kalimantan, to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before he was able to get to Palo.
"We are very sorry for the loss," he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of victims of the earthquake can be reached by thousands, as the disaster management agency reports that access to Donggal, Siggy and Butong cities is limited.
“The number of victims is probably growing as many people are still under rubble and many have still not been able to get out of there,” says the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which were six metres high, devastated the city of Palu, where the death toll would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: "The victims are being helped every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross employees are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
Tragedy has already taken on quite a serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidododo arrived in Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces in particular, saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to accomplish all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombock, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight, which had suffered a collapse in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person had disappeared while it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely fled the sinking plane.
Air Niugini states that as of Saturday day, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and aircraft crews after they crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The reasons for the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The United States Air Force and Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane could not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane says the plane's getting too low on the runway.
"And that's very good," Jane adds.
Jane told us that he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was in the belt.
He also said that the stewardess panicked and shouted on board, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen repairing the docks nearby also helped rescue by using the inflatable boat on which they were delivering people to the shore before the plane went under about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have been killed during the past two decades in airplane accidents with companies registered in PNG, but none of these disasters were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove that a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning in 2014 from a woman resident of Mississippi.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Roulette, testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to produce a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old Quinn Tellis accused and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim the night she died.
Roulett explained that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people with several mobile phones; according to this, Tellis spent the night with Chambers, which is contrary to his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to his cell phone records, he was near Chambers; when the circumstances turned out, Sanford was questioned by the police.
Sanford stated in his testimony that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they were only called for one week.
Roulett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” says Hale.
The defence must begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the “aware hip hop”?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight the negative attitude of this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group of Bristol argues that hip-hop content has changed, leaving the initial political and social problems.
The group wants to return to its roots and make the “aware” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sued a family couple because of a racist text
The New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had turned out to be “another black” who had mistakenly sent a nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, arguing that a lawsuit has been filed with “the purpose of extortion”.
Linsie Plasco-Flexman, mother of two, expressed concern at the fact that the new nanny offered child-care services by Giselle Morris was black when she came to her family on her first working day in 2016.
“NOEEEEEE, IT’S NOT ONE MORE BLACK”, said Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a text to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she twice mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris.
Realizing her bloatedness, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that a nanny who was an African-American was doing a bad job and that they were expecting a Filipino instead of an African-American, reported New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris now goes to the family court and seeks compensation for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The husbands disagree with the charge of racism, and they claim that Maurice's dismissal can be considered a reasonable step, as they would no longer be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she really didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, of the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone who you have been rude to, even though you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!
Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation”.
“And are you prepared to pursue a man in such a situation?
Not very nice of you," added a bank worker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already passed its sentence on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with a talking bear, says a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It is very interesting to know that Paddington is very successful.”
She also explained that her father had worked as an operator for the BBC before he had decided to write the children's book on bears and would have refused to publish with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his book was both “joyful and bitter” because last year their author did not stop.
With regard to Paddington's bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became famous.
“He was a quiet and modest man,” his daughter says.
“The Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really take that success as his own merit.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success in that way.
Subdington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
“I kept calling and saying that everything was really bad, that something had gone wrong,” said Mrs. Ednan Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes, and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications her doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families around me.
I had to hold myself firmly.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan Laperusa, complaining about her daughter's loss, boarded a plane with other passengers, coping with the great loss she had just suffered.
“No one knew what had happened,” she said.
“My head was gone, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming sense of compassion for Hope.
He needed so much my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women survivors of loss of loved ones prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, living in Leeds, says that her son was a great cook and had a fucking adorable smile.
"Everybody loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, there is a light in the room.
But before he died, he left his job because he was experiencing a truly terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was found dead by his own brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop worrying about the chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards “to make people know that there is someone to turn to and tell everyone, even if it's your friend.
You must not sit there and keep quiet and talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she had lived for 15 years — not shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or anything about it,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
And when they opened their gifts, he did not even look at the children.
She says that his death was a great injury to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shocked our family.
It ripped her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the hairline: the FBI is starting an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked — an investigation limited in time and volume — we could bring some unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break up” against the growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The interim elections will be held in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, everything will go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who has been working at the White House for Mr. Bush from time to time, and who thanks Bush has met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equal vote and confirm his candidacy for a Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea decreased with Kim
Since Kim Chen-Yun came into power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined, the South Korean legislator stated.
Apart from the data provided by the Ministry of the South, Ben Seug stated that, compared to 2,706 escape cases recorded in 2011, this figure had decreased to 1,127 cases last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers who had exported people.
Phinehas does not make public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (PMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was following the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen-yong in Singapore, where they reached a common agreement on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yoon Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue by their sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally”, Mr. Ri said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Kavanaugh “extergent”, and claims he is not fit to work with the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “extremely” and said that because of his temperament, he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to act this way, she would have been called an outcast,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony at the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that occurred when they were both still teenagers.
Kavanaugh spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even screaming and gasping about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's Democrats, calling it “a grotesque and well-planned murder of an active person”, organized by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kavano's testimony merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he treats the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority of the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: If he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is present,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the D.C District Court of Appeal.
Pelosy added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Cavanaugh regarding the Law on Available Medical Services or “Roy v. Wade”, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings of his candidature, Kavano asked whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to allow a hysterical and biased person to serve as a supreme judge and to say, ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi says.
And women have to own it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of rage; it cannot go through without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think?”
She went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman who was working somewhere in charge, and she said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed the technique by which she explained to her interviewer, "You can think that I am crying because I am upset.
I'm really upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in a man-dominated office: I cried once from angry anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a heartless manager, who I was always terribly afraid of, and dragged onto a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They do not know that you weep in anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think they've finally brought you here."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on some frivolous plot and left the race, and Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me 30 years later with a smile.
“There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign had already come to an end, and it was heavily lagging behind in fundraising, and so she swore she would not participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given her $1000 for men, had only offered her 250.
“What do I do for them, what do I do for them, what do I do for them?” she wondered.
When she gave the speech, declaring that she would not carry out the official campaign, she was so affected by emotion — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access to voters, as well as by the discrimination on the grounds of sex, that she was suffocating.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schroeder, “how the press reacted to it.
"It was possible to think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my diary?

How Trade War With America Can Help Beijing
Experts believe that the first valves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is still far from over, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made the first warning early this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected goods amounting to £200 billion (150 billion), in fact taxed half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has each and every time applied equivalent counterattacks by setting US taxes of $60 billion, ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response against the United States will be equivalent every time, and the second largest world economy is unlikely to begin to face at least the smallest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to withdraw, but publicly withdrawing the United States would be too shameful for Si Jinping, President of China.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing is able to properly play its cards, the US trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a speedy political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic deadlock in any of these countries is in fact far more dangerous than the observers previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Centre for New American Security, Asian-specializing Analytical Centre.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria is “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by war for more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe fortifies victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Cup of Ryder 2018 by beating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already won six consecutive games on European land, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who gained 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, took his first long shot at the 16th steaming hole, giving up his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds, becoming 1-by-4 players who once went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5:4 player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Turbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, resigned 2-1 Jan Polter from England, who may have been a member of the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Hispanic Sergio García, veteran of the eight Cups of Ryder, has won the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stay here today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have a cup again.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Remus, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a 2-1 single game account.
“I feel incredibly proud of this victory — I have grown up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23 - year - old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, with Jack Niklaus alone.
The U.S. assembly struggled all weekends in vain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the high-class golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furic said after his team's unsettling statement: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to shake Europe a little.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played beautifully.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Cuban Ryder Committee, and we'll move forward to succeed.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost."
Red tide: News The concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects a general decline in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, extensive flowering is reported, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red tide stretches about 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Li.
The oats can be seen about 10 miles off the Hillsboro coast, but compared to last week, their numbers have dropped significantly.
The Red tide is also observed in Pascoe district.
The average concentration in and near Pinellas District was reported last week, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro Coastal Zone, high concentrations in the Manati and Sarasota Districts and in coastal zones, the average concentration in Charlotte District, the high concentration on the Lee Coast and the low concentration in Collier County.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts there is still a possibility of irritability in the airways.
No such likelihood was reported in Northwest Florida last week.
