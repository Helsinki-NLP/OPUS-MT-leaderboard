TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network of TikTok censored video clips mentioning Tiananmen Square, Tibet Independence, or the banned religious group Falungun, described The Guardian.
The documents from the publication indicate that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the annex to advance China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
The majority of violations concerning China's policy fall under “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unfavourable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that social network activities do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in the Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under “the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or public figures”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Xin Yin, the Indian policy of Mahatma Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kyn Hee, Indonesian President Joko Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, according to the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by the social administrators and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too severe are the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited to the TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were outdated and no longer applied: “We are now using a localized approach to modernize, and we are attracting independent local professionals.”
Russian users TikTok do not have specific restrictions on publications, according to the co-founder of the Praduser Centre, Rustem Bogdanov.
Preduser Centre is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All bloggers' advertisements "Preduser Centre" agree with the social media, but user materials can be posted without agreement, is passed on to Bogdanov.
On the question of whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, Bogdanov responded positively and said that he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov: “Basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: there can be no shocking content, discriminating statements, etc.”.
But any content that the moderators don't like, Zaripov notes, can be deceived by these rules.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of them under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the neurosect analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, says Bogdanov.
If the nerost has decided that the user is younger, his account may be deleted, he adds.
According to the RBK, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the Kovorking WeWork.

Russian warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, the number of phone calls from frauds has increased, replacing the bank’s phone number.
This is reported by Commersanta, referring to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communications operators with more than 2.5 thousand phone numbers from which clients of various financial organizations called.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
Another 218 had been blocked and 59 had been restricted to financial services.
CB Deputy Head of the Information Security Department Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered a replacement number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Centre Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a duty under the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanka and Alpha Bank, information was confirmed on an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a replacement number.
As reported in the Bilaina press service, part of the information on the fraudulent calls transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with clients have been included in the lists.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Centre Bank plans to establish a fraud database to which the communications operator will address each call to verify the number.
He explained that it would be necessary to amend legislation to create such a base.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the Alliance at the 74th session of the UN Genasembly.
The genius described this during his presentation at Columbia University in New York.
Replying to the question whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had really discussed the issue and stressed that he had not stated in his reply the deadline for Ukraine to join NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, writes RT.
The Crimea offered the Green Alternative to NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, should instead take up good neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-Chair of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinec reported.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the predecessor's mistakes, but should listen to the [US President's] council Donald Trump, who has heard with acid, and to establish relations with the President of Russia," Czech journalist RIA Novosti said.
Chegrinec noted that Zelensky was a good actor but a bad politician.
He said it would only be possible for the Ukrainian President to remain in power if relations with the RF were established.
Earlier on 27 September, NATO's Jens Stoltenberg announced that he had interviewed Zelenski on the subject of the country's accession to the Alliance.

Money is more important to football.
Barcelona blackmails Naymar.
Spain's Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player, Najmar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the French move to the Paris Saint-Jereman.
The case was almost brought to trial, but the Catalonians offered the player a solution without Femi’s intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Najmar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had an interesting focus: By agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forwards were in the GNP for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans, and now he wants to take away the remaining 18.
Few Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for the late payment.
When Neumar’s claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Bluegrants insist that the bonus was believed to be the whole contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only a quarter of the euro of 40 million has been allocated to the player and requires a refund of the proportional part of the first payment.
But most interestingly, in the summer of Najmar and Barsa, we almost agreed to return the prodigal player to Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for a back-up of the forwards remains.
According to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not settled in a pre-trial manner, it would exclude the possibility of a Brazilian return.
Najmar himself wants to return so badly that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.
The most important thing is to continuously increase your financial literacy.

He played for the Red Cross Club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze of the Russian champion twice.

A man with a samurai sword tried to stand in a dumpster's trunk
The resident of the American city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over the weight found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller dug into a dog of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, a late - night stroller.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black freighter among the discards.
Miller saw Bivers's find and got upset.
He thought he could claim to be a freighter because he was the first one to dig in the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bivers grabbed the truck and ran away with it to his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same dog and began to pursue the opponent.
He drove Bivers around his house.
Miller pulled a sword out of his legs and started waving at them in the direction of the truck hijacker.
Beavers told Miller that it was recorded on video.
I noticed the camera, and Miller ran away, but he threatened to come back.
The Beavers left the truck in the yard and went into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman walking into his yard and taking away a load of insults.
The police have already searched Miller for driving a car without a license.
The man was detained, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a strange woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he responded that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he had stopped, had not allowed him to smoke.
Mass riots on threes
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests, the more noticeable it falls into fragments and loses its political filling.
The evidence of mass disturbances itself does not support verification, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case down on brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the lifting of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must be encouraging to society, but it will certainly leave in the extreme irritation of the force forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances) - Alexey Minajlo was suddenly released from custody without any obligation, and then several hours later, and completely rehabilitated: SCR dropped the charges.
Almost two months later, several professional communities took him into custody: historians, priests, literaries.
After that, there were only two accused in mass riots (probably 13): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house on 3 September, and Samardin Rajabov, to whom the court extended arrest until the end of December (also accused of violence against the representative of the government, para. 318 of the Criminal Code).

He also added that punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
At the same time, however, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and on the exit of the country from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case has been brought against Bartecki on the first paragraph of the 82nd section of the Criminal Law of the country - “Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish police abuses on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has drafted amendments to the Police Act to protect the detention of order from the proliferation of defamatory and degrading information on the Internet.
On Friday, there was an application for public discussion of the bill on the Federal Portal of Laws, and the draft document itself had not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is designed to protect the honour and dignity of the police officer from “proliferation in information and communications networks, including the Internet”, of information of a debilitating nature, including those of a discrediting nature”.
How is it intended to protect the police from defamation on the network is not clarified.

For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300,000 roubles is provided, and for the re-infringement, an administrative arrest of up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media by blocking Jaroslav edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Novgorod Regional Court of Novagorod struck a local resident with 30,000 rubles for placing on the network “two records of information in an inappropriate form that offends human dignity and social morality and manifests contempt for society, the State, the authorities exercising State authority in the RF”.

Of the most famous are the base dust.
The phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.

The club from Astana, which in various years was called Dynamo, Celnik, Astana and Janice, was disbanded in 2014.
He was the one who protected his colors in 2004 and 2008.
“I learned about the renaissance of the Zenis football club, organized by its sufferers.
And he couldn't stay away!
I spent a year and a half in this club.
It wasn't the best time for results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its loyal painers who have always been with the team!
I'll always be in memory of the Munajtpas Stadium where I killed my 200th ball in my career!
"Genesis" has to be restored!
He's got a huge story, and he's got great painkillers.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the authorities of the city will give them back their home club!" said the spindlemen in Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched the Onx rocket.
For the first time, the mine defences launched a winged missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onics started off at a distance of 350 kilometres, and 200 of them flew over the land, which is a record for this type of rocket.
The safety of the shooting was ensured by about 10 Pacific warships and ships, as well as by naval aircraft, reported to the MoF Department of Information and Mass Communications.

The hydrometcentrum called the faithful folk sights
In Russia, there are many popular perceptions that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the hydrometer center, we checked all the observations that are supposed to be working.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted, in the short term.
As scientific head of the Russian Hydromet Centre Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be pleasant, as our ancestors observed.
And if the light of the sky shines, there will be rain on the next day.
The second working observation is based on bird observation.
More often they talk about petals, if they're flying low, it's usually for rain.
This is explained simply - when the air is soaking wet, the mowers wet their wings and the feathered ones have to lower themselves to hunt insects, says TASS.
On different continents, there are people's perceptions.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
On that day, it is believed that we must observe the trumpet coming out of our den to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil stains have been found on the beaches of north-eastern Brazil
The oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in the north-east of Brazil.
The vortex of pollution was scattered over 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of coastline.
Reports of the first oil stains discovered began on 2nd September.
By Thursday, however, the number of them, as well as the territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it was stated that they were not in conformity with the oil obtained from the sites in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped off one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably got into the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil union of Pernambuco and Paraiba Roger Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected North-East states, environmental defenders found nine sea turtles entirely covered with oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning contaminated beaches.
For the time being, the Institute’s experts recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil side and report all detected pollution.

The Russians have no reason to retire - V. Matvinko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvinko, believes that the Russians do not have enough stock to fully earn the guaranteed pension product bill in the country.
The practice of increasing pension through personal savings in the world is quite common.
It's another matter of how timely her introduction is.
“I think a large part of the population now has income, of which there is nothing to give them to increase pensions in the future,” said V. Matvinko.
In the opinion of the Speaker, the Russians cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and payment of the pension, because “the constant changes in this area have finally confused them”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, the social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account national realities," said V. Matvinko “RIA Novosti”.
The head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees, and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings, must be provided.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September that a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPT) should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance.
Among its core elements is the very voluntary order of accession of citizens to the savings system, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax exemptions for business and tax deductions for citizens.

The rightful owner of the picture of Getty Images Image caption News About the Care of a Favorite Superheroe From a Cinematized Marvel has angered many loyal worshipers
One of the most famous comic book heroes, Spider-Man, will remain in the Kinovellen Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in franchise films.
This was known from Sony's press release, which states that the third part of the Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on 16 July 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to consensus on income-sharing, leading to the "Spider Man" leaving the quino-male Marvel.
The kinogaro's rights lie with Sony.
She rented them for Marvel's Disney movies.
As a result, Sony received income from the productions in the cinemas and Disney from the souvenirs and toys.
At some point in time, Disney was reported to have stopped making such a provision, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey to the filmed Marvel will continue.
"We are all very happy at Marvel Studios that we can continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a mark.
It is a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," his press release says.
And Faigi recalled that Sony was also creating her own filmmaking, built around Spider-Man.
"It happened that he was the only super-powered hero to be found in various quino-males.
So as Sony continues to develop her own spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account a excerpt of The Wolf of Wall Street, in which hero Leonardo di Caprio screams, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on companies’ conflicts emerged in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash prize from films about Spider-Man, provided that both companies paid half the costs of painting production.
But it didn't work out for Sony.
News of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the Kinovese Marvel angered many loyal worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have been very cooperative for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue joint work has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spiel Man] fans.
We are glad that we can go forward together."
The film "Misters: Final", which united Spider-Man, Tora, Halka and other Marvel superheroes, became the most cashier in the history of the world cinema, moving from the first place "Avatar".

The expert told me why you should give up tea in packets.
A team of scientists from Canada representing the University of McGill found that over ten billion microplastic particles were added to the tea cup in five minutes.
The powder can also be added to the packaged drink, said the Nation News expert in the field of food security, Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be specified on the package.
Drinks at the end of the season don't get thrown out, so they can be in tea.
"Better, the packets don't always include tea plants," Tihonova said.
She said it would be better to refuse to use such a drink in favour of tea for the allowance that is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in its composition but also in its production, the micro particles warmed up to high temperatures, which allowed them to begin to allocate harmful substances.
“The best thing to do is to buy clean green or black tea - it will be less in such a drink,” the expert said.

As reported in the Parliamentary Gazette, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Economic Policy Council, Andrey Kutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkinu, and Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, proposing to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation actors to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional links
The Economic Policy Council Committee of the Federation has compiled information from the regions on the business development and legalization programmes in place, as well as on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told senators about SME development issues and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between the regions has been insufficient, resulting in the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes across the country by the business community in all regions,” said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (to be edited).
In addition to the specialized ministries, regional data are also sent to the heads of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such exchange will be to provide information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator of the Parliament.

The self-employed continue to get out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelic Region proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business” because it “is best suited to the content of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanova area, amendments are considered necessary to extend the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities in the area of housing and repair, physical training and physical training.

Sanctioners in Russia dropped 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, the supply of agriculture and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has been estimated to have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to RF President Vladimir Putin in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioning countries, compared to 3 million 442,000 tons during the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
It is the supply of goods that have not been placed under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, falling volumes of prohibited imports were offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Let us recall that, by the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the rules on the destruction of agriculture, raw materials and food that were prohibited from entering Russia in the framework of counter-sandries.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the regulation was extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 until 31 December 2020.
Initially, the destruction order applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, as of 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, as of 1 January 2016 - Ukraine joined the list.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the illegally imported "sanctionary" (products which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government authorized the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal way.
As West sanctions continue, the RF has also extended its response.
However, products imported for personal use by citizens are not subject to this measure.
The ban does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kg.
However, the head of the Council to the President of the RF for Civil Society Development and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously called the “just immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on human education.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption was launched by Rosbaznadzir at the beginning of June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council to the President of the RF.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it was wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how we can use it for the purpose of assessing quality.

Chile began building a 1 billion-euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, the building of an E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) has officially begun this week, while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project is being developed.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on manufacturing equipment and building an observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 100 feet [39 m].
It will be collected from 798 6-angle segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 metres, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photos of the planets outside the Solar System, the stars in other galaxies, as well as the earth's diaries.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the centre of Milky Way.
Despite the fact that construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other experts have been developing for three years since the announcement of the first E-ELT plans.
A contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
