Petr Čech: Break at the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big break.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently deputy goalkeeper of Chelsea, now does not sit over the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
She sits in the NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is preparing for a Czech representation at the game general with Americans and then also at a sharp start of qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch in the new season Prime Minister League gets the advantage of Thibaut Courtois, Czech first in ten years in the London Club he got a replacement position.
Before that time, it was speculated that the Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in battle with Atlética and failed even to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about Paris SG's interest.
By the season of the French League, he had two wins and two drawbacks, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing boot club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance sheet in the league, and he broke up with Lille on weekends at 1:1.
On the boulevard English websites today, news came out that Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, Chech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybeth wrote course 4:1 on it.
Peter, is it possible that during the remaining few hours, you'll change your uniform?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe during the day, there's an offer that won't be rejected.
How would such an offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what kind of offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties, above all, depending on Chelsea's position if the club were to decide whether or not to do so.
Is it technically feasible to make such a leap now that you're in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new area?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, and they're all at some party meeting, and there's definitely a lot of overstepping going on today.
So somehow it would be realistic.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing him out?
The situation where I did not catch the new season in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of careers.
But there's no reason to panic, to pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this fight about the position of goalkeeper Chelsea and he is at the coach he chooses to make the decisions in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from the personal page of the family’s need.
Is it possible you'd catch another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But anything in football is possible.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring the very American ideal that working rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect union organisations as civil law.
"As trade unions operate, jobs are in place for the middle class," said Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congressional Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to present, together with the example of occasional rights, John Lewis, a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation gives workers the same legal option to prevent discrimination in trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and to stop anti-committee forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees facing discrimination, if they want to join the unions, to be tried by a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation - is the right and necessary initiative.
I'm sure it's not a radical initiative, at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents suggest in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union struggles that have taken place in recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to collect.
When the United States captured Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions were playing a role in forming a new Japan, including their language, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to assemble, negotiate collectively and act as guarantors. ”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's Fascism will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and they included a clause that openly states: “The right to create societies that secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every profession or profession.
The arrangements that will restrict or seek to damage this right will be repealed. The measures leading to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and the Roosevelt guarantee that “everyone has the right to form and enter trade unions in order to protect their interests.”
The Americans for generations have accepted the basic premise that human rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in a position of equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the union power of the nation has not diminished, but it has been extended.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and production, to an unimaginable level.
Those who invade the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and expansion of civil rights protection in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is greatly delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have raised America and made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have closed all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
On Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which according to lawyers would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A regulation under the signature of Louisan Governor Bobby Jindal in June to enter into force on 1 September would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of the exercise of their practice.
The judge’s resolution means that doctors may continue to carry out legal abortions temporarily and in the meantime have to provide this authorisation.
“The proposing party will be able to carry out its activities legally and in the meantime to obtain permission,” says Federal Judge John deGravelles' resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain a permit for the resolution that was last in a series of similar measures.
"Today's decision ensures to women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the delusional law to prepare them for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law by the prosecution.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics, which were not among the prosecutors, and also requested the granting of this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have approved similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures illegal.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, together with the American Maternity and Gynecologists Association and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this authorisation places requirements on physicians that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The victims of the abortion objected to measures aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would have resulted in the closure of clinics.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has stated that in Louisiana only one doctor conducting abortions is authorised.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the abortions, this doctor would also, out of fear of his safety, cease the procedure, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities indicated in their response that they would not punish doctors who carry out the abortion while waiting for an application for the grant of rights to be settled.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer is more common in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video holding their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 % of five years after diagnosis of ovaries.
Research head Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines can slow lung and ovaries cancer
Women's researchers monitored during the seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the survival chance affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest rate of survival was observed in older women who were diagnosed with cancer in the advanced stage.
In women in rural and remote areas of the state, about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that factors may be delayed diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best treat gynekooncologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving medical services at a distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programmes to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan reported that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is irrespective of the geographical location of the low, which emphasises the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquercancer is published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, in her 33 years, young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive forms of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under 35 years of age could lead to the loss of up to £10 million per year by today's young generation of consumers.
According to the report, people who rent their own gardens spend 55% of the amount they spend on their own.
As other threats to the sector, which earns an estimated £5 billion per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the likeness of longings instead of gardening used as a parking space and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of owned houses fell from 61 % to 43 % over the six years, one household is the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society stated that living in a sub-dwelling or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden counselor for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular plant cultivation in flower plants - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also for this year, he predicted a higher discharge due to better weather, which came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin at the reunion of his youth organization, which resembles Hitler Jugend most of all, saved the nuclear weapons, and basically revealed to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can control both the drunken nationalism and the fact that the inferiority complex can transform them into imperialistic lusts.
Time is running in the east, probably not in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the East it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and it was necessary to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration ruled Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazi powers were seized, followed by an explosion of nationalism similar to today's situation in Russia.
And then the exact same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimír Putin, and certainly many of the Russians, are probably struggling after Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled in front of them.
Probably Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe few Vladimír patted on his shoulder, maybe didn't invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe he just started underestimating him and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, he pretended he didn't want to go anywhere, and he was grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to go back to his lost position.
He starts slow, he's got time.
He's probably a life leader, so where would he go?
He's banging the Caucasus, now he's slapping the Ukrainians, then there are midgets from the Baltic.
Those Russian bears have been pinching their fur for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice that by now, which is kind of jumping out and is definitely making a snag to the Far East.
And those Germans of Vladimír also have a pretty good temper, and I put it on their ass at 45.
How about we make a new Novorossy in Karl's Vary?
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours, and how they're being squeezed there, and they're already trying to knock some of them off.
Our veterans will remember how they had been in Czechoslovakia until now.
The Prime Minister, Mr Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be peeled like onions, and I'll eat their entire EU.
That would have been so much fun if they'd jumped out on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as explosives, we'll use our fellow countrymen who live on their territory.
The Russians are all over the place, and when they're told they're being squeezed there, they're just pushing them, and we're not gonna let them, we're gonna protect them.
And once again the Russian will rule, for what else is born to.
After all, Europe is only good as a template for proud Ivan to dance to.
Turkey calls US diplomat for espionage news
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on US and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Prime Minister Bulent said that the US Charge d'Affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by former US analysts, the National Security Agency was Turkey's priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has bogged down the importance of the report and has declared that all major states are monitoring each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service focused on Ankara, sparked a more embittered reaction from the Turkish government.
The series Game of Thrones presents the next tricks of the fourth row
Artists of the Games of the Thrones are currently recording episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how fourth - row tricks were created.
The most visible are computer modifications to the serial environment and mass scenes, when a giant army of famous Daenerys becomes of the noise of soldiers.
Magaluf Police Director Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented to the Office of the Mallorian State Prosecutor evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants of the City of Calvia.
The head of Calvia police on Mallorca's holiday island was arrested after the charges of the ascended entrepreneurs and the owner of bars in the notoriously celebrated party district in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after being charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punt Ballen, a street in which most bars and nightclubs are located in Magaluf.
On Friday, according to the Mallorca Diario Internet Journal, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants of the city’s district of Calvia to the Prosecutor’s Office in order to combat corruption.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish State Police for connected to the corruption charges and will be heard by the judge together with Navarr.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of night-time enterprises as having a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer about making money, but about survival," one businessman said in court.
Don't mess with our lives.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the main site of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist appeared on YouTube, providing oral sex to 24 men during the bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to monitor drunkards and rioters in a number of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where an oral sex event took place, was forced to close down for a year and together with tour organizers at Carnage bars to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluf Tourist Resort, which is mainly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol - related accidents, including fashion waves known as “balconing”, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO brought south South Australia an ice surprise, came with a heavy rain and a sharp wind, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm precipitation is due in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night of Sunday.
The last rain presented itself together with a few short jumps associated with storms and wind waves, which began eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought about 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few early spring doses came in last winter, the city’s temperature dropped again on Monday at only 15.8 °C.
It is believed that storm weather has contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to land shortly after 19:30, at a short distance, but it was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to land a delay.
Wind waves at Adelaide Airport at that time reached the ground at about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave the second landing and eventually landed at around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused the delay of other flights, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, they will reach a maximum of 16 °C in Adelaide on Tuesday, and there may be one or two overdoses.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas rockets and mortars attacked their homes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is remembered for fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to the communities in southern Israel the perceived attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the shell employees, who were hit by a rocket, removed the remains from the wall from the shards and slowly await the return of the children.
“We’re a little afraid, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibucu Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that “it’s a little strange” to go back to school again.
"We have had a few difficult moments and we have not left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the inhabitants.
Until the cease-fire of last week's war, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements, such as Saad, remained inside their homes or their homes, fled to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, where a shooting from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, with a return weight.
The minister of education said that about 12 families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, saying: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a timeless peace.
Although the cease-fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key problems as a request by Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and to reopen Gazan airports and ports.
Israel demands that Hamas be disarmed and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers who were killed in the war.
The new round of indirect actions is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these numbers and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan radicals fired during the battles on Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country 4,591 rockets and mortar shells.
More than 5,000 air raids and other attacks were again carried out by the Israeli army.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in hundreds of United Nations schools that turned into a temporary shelter.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and due to the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed last week at the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that school will be opened soon so that we can complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm behind you.
And Lafatu suffers from fever
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague in the middle of a preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent introductory match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 - member cadre, the Spartan attacker David Lafat has problems with the temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's got some problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right as soon as possible," Coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it is two or three days, or tomorrow it will be fit, it will be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide about," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has a disease, but it's not like they can't train or participate in a match Wednesday with the US," the Czech coach said.
Sunday night Willow called as the last player of the Spartan publisher Luke Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, and other midwives were included.
I have decided that Luke is a 25 - year - old speculative player.
It was a very difficult decision, but I am behind it," Vrba pointed out.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, nominations could still be changed.
For example, in Liberec Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick, flashed on a weekend with excellent performance.
Of course there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see how David Lafat is doing.
In case he can't be available on Wednesday, I don't claim that I can't dominate any of the players who took part in the Czech League," Vrba noted.
This afternoon there is a team of training sessions in Strahova, then a classic pre-war training session in front of the U.S. duel on Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by autographs.
The game with Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premiere victory under the Vrbo.
In the last three preparatory matches, he lost two drawbacks and lost one.
The qualification match with the Netherlands is then on the programme on 9 September from 20:45.
On foot going to the Netherlands to Italy
Willow is pleased to have more time for training than previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we haven't had so much time on before.
Now we will be able to concentrate only on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba praised.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy, and the duel will be monitored by former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna take a look at him.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba told bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the capital city of Australia, Data CoreLogic Hedonic rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9 %, more than twice in one year until August 2013, but profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne run the market.
The RP Data numbers show that the prices of flats in Sydney increased by 16,1 % last year, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11,7 %.
Among other strong markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was located, which damaged the state's ordered expenditure reductions and where prices increased only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be “a real test for the market. ”
"In view of the continuing high level of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months," he said.
My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry is testing comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother died, Henry went through “excellent” therapy, and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were grown-ups - went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass with beer or the beauty of hitting cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Recently Henry visited Dudley's lair, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he saw what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light there today, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy maze where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and planting.
My dad always got in the tub and he was just lying there, and then he heard him slowly starting to sing for himself, because he was laughing at the store.
When I was walking around, I realized that this is the years I'd been working to feed the family, and I began to appreciate it more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't tell anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, made it possible for him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With French, who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a very, very large weight and began to manifest the symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to hold a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After he got credit from criticizing his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
Followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's Plots.
It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16, and he worked at the factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parody and wrote about him in a New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-70s: “For a long time I was the only black copycat/combe on TV.”
He was studying for the march.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make fun, be a star, and be on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the right to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, the entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually performed his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer ours for that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with a crowd.
What was “years and years valued the main product of British television” but was also “a grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced figures that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984, and in the 1990s he was among others known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the chef’s comedy series!
For the next decade, his commercials, papers, TV shows and role-playing movies took him away, but after sending his Lenny Henry.tv series to the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're going to do now, Len, it looks like you're stuck in one place or you're getting a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first one was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't teach him very well at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said: “You should try it. ”
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
“That’s it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the kidnapping of the audience.
“The voice in my head said to me, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You play, so stay in character."
Henry in Plotech in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the Word of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it gives determination.
The game was also well received, so it is like a sign from God that says, “This is what you should do. ”
Of course, it says so with a loud voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has a comedian's brain - the whole time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances when he enters and emerges from the role of an impersonator.
I decided not to stand up because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want, I do live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy about it as I used to be.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
It's a joy to sit in one room with a director who helps give up the outline of the beginning, the means and the end of the road - I don't think I want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine on non-existent employees
Kenya started with a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after the state service has left.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars a month ($700 000) on the salaries of non-existent employees and, in the event of further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that the payments are still deposited in bank accounts even after the employee dies or after the staff member leaves the government, BBC from Nairobi, Wanyam Chebusiri, reported.
All civil servants shall be required to arrive at the identification centres for the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, in the declaration of the Government.
He goes on to say that anyone who does not arrive without an apology will be expelled from the payroll.
"By setting up real public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its economic savings and will also be used to clear the payment charter at both levels of government, and will solve the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigur, the Ministry of Development and Planning's secret.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "scramble" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "scramble against the government".
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking officials detained.
Some of them were involved in a December investigation into corruption that focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising criminal gangs and telephone wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time of the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer vacations.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools had a traditional 1st September ceremony.
Not all over Ukraine, there's peace.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, joined by the Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, visited by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that the children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated with children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found the boss for a difficult time.
He carries with him a cloud of fame from the banking world, media management and internal conclaves of conservative parties.
She's got her own front lines.
The career began in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world Pearsons.
She was the CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, and she gave up her post when Pearson's junior partner took over the highest position in Pearson's parent company.
It's been said that a million pounds were coming in.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the Director's work as a potassium with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of its own management of the BBC, but also out into the public's voice in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands thorough reform.
Which, however, would risk coming to a company that's as complex as the Chinese dynasty, spreading it, and thus losing himself to work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
As the competition range expands and the new technology challenges old security, it brings with it immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC a great danger.
For a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British public buys a share in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is 96% of the household, each of which costs only 40p a day.
Moreover, the BBC's promise is clearly rising to 53% of its supporters, compared to 31% ten years ago.
BBC service models have changed: Today my newspaper headlines are displayed on my mobile phone and the shows I missed, I can see the player.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says an offensive tweet has not been approved.
Tweet from the official Twitter account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic state attorney who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account, which has been separated from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and withdrew it," he said in his next post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the questionnaires immediately.
Although tweets have been sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published a humorous, humorous picture of State Agent Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which, Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 elections, brought in before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet said: “I don’t always drive three times as much alcohol in my blood as the limit is allowed... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for calling me to account. ”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Authority.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, was responsible for the Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the supervisor to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is against the Constitution.
Perry interrupted the $7.5 million payment from the state fund to protect public interest, which has its headquarters in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it will be celebrated.
After he finished his presidential campaign in 2012 at the fifth place on the committee of his party, Perry responded to speculation that he could have finished, a tweet with his own picture of him running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is going back to normal.
One of London's most prominent development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble led Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's demanding clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point of 2013 has returned to the normal level of transactions.” He adds that it provides a “stable environment for functioning”.
The London housing market was doing well during the decline, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to data from the cadastral office, prices in the city only jumped by 18.5% last year, far exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and in Wales.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening libra they have not been so attractive to foreign buyers of London real estate in recent months, some of them have also intimidated the introduction of new real estate taxes and the possible "separate taxes" with which politicians came before parliamentary elections next May.
Last week, Foxtons, a London real estate agency, warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which presented stricter lending rules, would also slow down during the second half of the year the rate of market growth in real estate and price sales.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced prices from home prices to 3% for the year 2015.
The volume of transactions according to the UA Ellis real estate office in London’s most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased the cash for forward sales to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well - looked-inhabited home in a good location remained the same, thus keeping the forward sale. ”
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 properties by the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, prior to the annual meeting, Pidgley said it was expected that Berkeley's annual earnings would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley stock stopped at 23,96 pounds in the afternoon at the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar's holder, Jennifer Lawrence, escaped to the Internet because of a hacker who claimed that he had a “list” of hundreds of more starting actresses.
Speaker stars of the movie "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and criticized the hacker for "obvious violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who has stolen the photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker's photos, originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly obtained thanks to the gap in the Apple iCloud Internet repository system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsenová.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. rest of the world” Winstead also criticised the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, famous for Nickolodeon iCarly and Victorious TV series, denied that the photos would be real.
It's better to ease it even more in the middle of the conversation. *meaning word play*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the spokesman for pop stars Ariana Grande denied that alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary demonstration of Howard Jacobson’s glorious new novel about love and the letter “J”
They dissolved, it's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complicated, too sharp, isolated, and perhaps a little edgy.
And then she shook his hand.
He's got it all figured out.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this ability was a startling love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the loneliness of life’s boredom and perhaps even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild warm hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
In the south, there was an elderly companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the snails slipped into the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was ingrown, and the weed resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a hut of children's stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the pre-nomination list at Man Booker Prize 2014.
The choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on the stretching chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying the unexpected warm spring afternoon, instantly setting up a public station, which the region provided comforting music and soothing news when his father, in this regard, reminded him of the old song of the long forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with covered roller skates.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played songs like that on radios.
They weren't banned - nothing was really forbidden - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into the desuetude, just like the word desuetudedo itself.
Human taste has proven to be beyond the law, and like people in books, they choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks, and romantic lovers, so they choose ballads in music.
Kavern was torn down by day and began to play the imaginary piano and the rude, comical voice of the serenade of Aillena's great feet.
Ailinn didn't get it.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was little.
His father told him that he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny anymore, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn's never heard one.
Not even jazz, even if it wasn't built out of law, they didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
In life, there was only room for one "if."
When she started playing the tune, people wanted to know exactly where she was going.
It's the same in humor.
His unpredictability went to people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor of a song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when favorite singers weren't black.
No laws, no pressure.
A loose society is one in which each part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, with temperament and constitution, went for entertainment and athletics, singing and running.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of the electronics gift, have taken responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a phone.
The Poles that remained were the plumbers, the Greeks who remained, washing the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while they were afraid of being put into the fire, feared that the fire would eat them next time - they opened a restaurant where the lab was selling and smoking water pipes, they were not paying attention to themselves, and the inactivity was slowly eating them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could have originated from the obscene words Kavern had just sang to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not repulsive," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but a neglected garden was an illusion of security.
Not a word could escape behind the soundprints.
Ailinn still didn't.
Why would your father like that?
He was going to say it was a joke, but he was afraid to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said at the end.
She shook her head unbelievably and overshadowed Kever's view.
All over the world, there was nothing more to see than the confusion of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked again.
No, not the feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
Do I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles," he tried.
I'm kind of perverse.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that was lurking in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was a deliberate cruel Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons, and she got off the bed, dropped the radio, and spilled the unsoaked wine.
Beige wine, so it wasn't worth the drink.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I am sickly attracted to you as an idiot," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes at the moment she stood up to him.
Did she think she was gonna get hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same thing as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shook against them.
The same confusion of men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more insensitive and flimsy than their ancestors, smugglers and depraves, angryly strayed from the pub to the pub, ready to reach out to any woman who dared to refuse or laugh at them.
Asshole?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First anointing her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antibody of faint ballads about love which the radio bled - first anointed her, then one murderer.
According to Kevern's opinion, overculturalism was an act of violence on its own.
Ailinn Solomons had him go away.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt unrelenting herself, but his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
Almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave - as if she was watching him from a window on the floor - a man who was touched by what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was broken for him and for all men in general, no matter how many of them killed her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hung up, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel like she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember the only moment today that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomons, herself, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 20-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where it was reduced or stopped directly, was most expected to be spent on its disposal of enough money and energy.
"It has done much and much more to do," she wrote, "to calm down the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the busy, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers rising above the lively walls of human kindness, there has been rarely ever."
Some things, however, are irreplaceable.
It may seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the poohs.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unfortunate stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is old brutality held in rural areas as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that there is new and violent intolerance at home, in the workplace, on roads and even in sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to get too mundane," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I have the impression that I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again upheld her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Keep your voice down.
"I am not asking therefore," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I would have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain type of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and commendable in itself, can at times distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are predestined to the church - things you call “stricken” and“ brutal” could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
It was as if it had happened, yesterday, that he was preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinovitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
He had pink - colored recommendations on his head on the light board that Ofnow had sent to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
To speak is better than to keep quiet, the singing word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand your reservations,” Esme Nussbaum replied, “when she was sure that her superior had finished, ” and I am not saying that the wound did not heal as we suggest it had healed.
My main concern is that if we do not get ahead of ourselves, we will make the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED.
This time, though, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz has joined the fingertips.
That was to mean endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps you may have taken and perhaps didn’t make your grandparents as mistakes.
You are also far too far away from talking about venting their “anger ” and“ distrust ” on the “other ones. ”
I should not remind anyone in your place that we do not speak of “us ” and“ them ” in our understanding of the past and in our protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
“Through whom, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “we are not blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was just or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add here - we agree on this together.
And just as there's no guilt to be seduced by, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the device is appropriate and possible.
To what is the past but to learn from it?
There's a past for us to forget about.
If there's anything I can add...
Luther Rabinovitz blew the fingertips.
"I will take your report into consideration," he said and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a way that was described by the passersby as “brutal and furious. ”
Coincidences happen.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims no coup plans - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesoth Kingdom military officers denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
The Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official headquarters and has occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After he declared himself threatened by death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntle Ntoi's speech army said it was not really a coup, but an army's response to the threat of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the leadership of the defense components of the Kingdom of Lesotho was acting after several information services reports were received, that several groups are in the police ranks that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a trigger in the country," said the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesothian defence components of the mark of coup d'état are likely to be carried out," he said.
The soldiers of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday, and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane declared that in his view he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended Parliamentary meetings due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the opposite claim, he did not undermine his government’s actions.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
According to a closely monitored survey in August, production growth in the euro area has slowed to a minimum of 13 months.
The final index of purchase managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell in August to 50.7.
The number higher than 50 stands for expansion.
New orders have expired and factories have damaged growing tensions between the EU and Russia because of Ukraine.
The numbers come from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area and with the risk of inflation deflation of 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that the ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to the one the United Kingdom and the United States had joined during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty of the manufacturer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's main economist.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months at 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has again moved from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have disappeared are also not too soothing," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to bring oil into the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing that can be said about the production overview of purchasing managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing. ”
He added: Producers in the euro area now have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds more uncertainty to increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has clearly affected - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the expensive ones.
He stated that as "more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were detained as hostages by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during the suffering that lasted three days and that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
Just ten years after the terrifying school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, were warned last night by surviving heroes against the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
On September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorist children and parents were captured and murdered, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy brought together the East and the West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to action and the future.
After ten years in Beslan, we returned to southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - should end.
A girl trying to get back into a wrecked gym
It was captured by Russia's leading photographer, Dimitri Beliakov, as he was only trying to get back into the bombed-up school gym in his underwear after the bomb exploded.
The confused Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
I had blood on my feet.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she had recovered fully, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I've got a piece of scrap left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn't destroyed it," she said with determination.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
Once a year, I go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Jerry Gapoev were killed there.
When we were little, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten the captivity, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I watch my picture on the Internet, when I go through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, they'll understand the disaster and they'll stop it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain shot believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia children's school begin at the age of seven) and he survived the school's grade siege in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At that time, the seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, he was running and he saw the crying butts on the way, he grabbed the baby by the hand, and they were running off with a shower.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead. ”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara wondered about the freedom and lay in a hospital with a wounded leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing news news of the World), where the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say the memories are getting pale.
I remember right after I dropped all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or they died.
We're saying they stayed in gym.
For a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose anything in the toy business, and how I went to the convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer for war.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I’m terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror,” says Damir, who participated in volunteer activities at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work with the police one time, and I hope I'm admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no kids out there screaming and running, and it took a few months to keep quiet.
He vividly remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for being able to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though she's ten years old, I still remember seeing her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste in borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how you used to play with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir shot at them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there's been and there's still going to be a lot of children killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a terrible thing it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's a nice and quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and he goes to the gym every now and then, and they light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember him lying on a couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons at play.
I can hardly believe I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I got back to my feet after the explosion, I looked around, and I saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my boy wasn't supposed to survive this hellish chance.
“I remember shouting, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced that he did not hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is different from the rest of us.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photograph was taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors of Beslan Grigori Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigori today
When he was running for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, he was terrified in his bloodbathed face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy stayed there for three days alone," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's always harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass before we remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Constantly returning memories: Grigorija's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternally like a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he was alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there's even a statue of the paying Gregory.
Grigori doesn't like looking at that picture, and at home we have it hidden in the library.
I understand that, but I also think that because of that picture, people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigorius says: “It is important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth will never be revealed.
Now they're investigating the meltdown in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
It takes tens of years to forget a little.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had a nightmare attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when it's September 1st, I go to gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, yet he survived
When the attack was underway, he was caught trapped in a gym, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw away.
Now I'm older and they say that kids with bad experiences can handle better - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I went to see a psychologist and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after that - it was the first time and the last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I am sitting on this well-known picture.
Survival: Gregory Farniev today, on the laptop with his photograph taken at the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I need to be careful about my knee, which I've injured, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't go to the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg for health reasons, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My next favorite is animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished my second year there.
He's learning how to treat all the animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should experience anymore.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will be here all the time.
He's in and he's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'll take part in the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there than I was.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown-up today, but he's carrying on.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's been undergoing several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's already outdone the whole thing from 50%, but I can't get over it and I can't forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and the pain only makes it worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me and that's the greatest gift God could ever give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's happening in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now nearing our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all the rebels and throw them away, as far as we can get.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who carried a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev carries to a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
In 2004, the world caught its breath when little Alyon was carried out by a Russian police officer in the arms of a Bezlan prisoner.
The terrorists let her go, but they kept her 30 - year - old mother, her ten - year - old sister Christine and Brother Makhar in prison.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona’s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife, Svetlana, they have a little girl named Christine after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, does not remember the attack at all and grew out of it a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that “they are a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep children away from memories that the tenth anniversary reminds us of.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to get better pictures and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a wide selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, and they all cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieving the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras and cameras have a scenic or recording mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment under water.
And before you go into it, find out how deep you can dive in with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for up to 5 feet, another for up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in regular and waterproof execution.
Do a few shots every time - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you compose photos, but the outdoors don't have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly visible underwater, and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a Bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure diffusion, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The deep depth of the light is greatly reduced.
If possible, stick close to the surface when taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but under water it's even more important because of the diminutive light.
This is especially important if you are recording with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill in the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to helping the sick to alleviate the pain caused by sickness and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and illness, patients treated in a debilitating majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with flu symptoms, and he found that he was impatient, and he included his wife, Juliet, indignantly.
He noted: “I want everything to be done sooner rather than later. ”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
His colleague did an x-ray on his chest.
He skied in the French Alps once for two weeks.
X-rays came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the vaginal or the pulmonary tract.
For most cancers, it's hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
Almost in all cases, asbestos - construction fibers, previously referred to as “miraculous, ” are now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma was not difficult to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even at the time of asbestos use, only a few groups of people came in close contact with him, such as shipowners, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in the industry in another era seems difficult today as a reason for concern.
Such a complacency, but it's not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is on its way to Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accidents victims.
Number of deaths resulting from mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we only now feel its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all forms of asbestos were finally prohibited by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before mesothelioma develops.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we study, and in the shops we shop.
So Mesothelioma does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged gardens from London’s trading houses to public schools do not constitute a refuge.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where they should treat us are the warehouses of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even consider isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and nurses - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital, who then showed mesothelioma in the last five years," said in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis for so long is not normal.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are going to have the same disease? ”
According to Professor Julian Pete's leading British mesothelioma expert, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic occurs in Britain, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the files from the archives of the courts to which the disabled often turn and demand compensation, it shows how much the mesotheliomaic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she exposed Janice Allen’s asbestos to negligence.
She worked nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, when she was overseeing two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was a flag ship company, a business on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two kids who are over 20.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed of being involved in a dream.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to its fibrosis structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even in brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and WHO consider it a “big health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous but brown asbestos (amasit) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high occurrence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]. ”
Staff member Marsk & Spencer was exhibited asbestos in a flag store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a substantial part of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment. ”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by ‘current use and ventilation’ of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as “a strong stream of air”.
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services has insisted that the Westminster Palace be given a “positive medical certificate”, it is now counting on the need for one million pounds and several years of work to be thoroughly examined, electricity modernised and asbestos removed by Parliament, and that after the 2015 elections, Members will be more likely to sit at the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre than at the Westminster Green benches.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
It is impossible to say whether this disagreement will cost lives.
Everyone can just wait now.
One person who was never able to determine when asbestos exposure occurred is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly, I was shaking.
It came out of nowhere.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd get home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the vagina, the epithelial around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that it was mesothelioma.
Eventually, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him chest X-rays and introduced his chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent to his lungs for analysis.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came into the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and was in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the epithelial of the chest cavity and the epithelial lung.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take too much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mesothelioma. ”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started meeting with the nurses from Macmillan Charity Organization, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It has turned out that asbestos has been used extensively, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to manifest a disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who are not at risk of employment.
The most dangerous thermally isolated tubes in the hospitals were in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be at risk.
However, staff members who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
It now appears that there were several decades after the hospital war a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could endanger the life of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed until today.
The students built Bunsen’s kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and councils because of its excellent insulation and inhospitable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Sometime in the countless hours of chemistry, the students built Bunsen’s kahn on an asbestos base.
A website was created dealing with the question of asbestos in schools.
The harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to recall in the 1970s when fighting the garden house.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the effect of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It’s taking a while before you realize it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I found out I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was to switch from being a doctor to being a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was difficult to understand all this," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told 12 months.
I remember saying to myself: “Well, I won’t live another Christmas.
That's how it is."
Mesotheliom is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers are breathed, they can settle down in the tomb, the embodiment of the lungs.
Asbestos fiber irritates the vagina and can cause mutation of the cell.
“The problem is inspired asbestos fibers shaped like needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the leading centre of mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during practice at the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “respiratory activity pushes them to the edge where the cartilage is located.
It's been invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is discussed in a heated manner.
Some people think she'd be worth a shot.
Treasures don't agree.
"You can't remove the ankle," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “is not responding too much to chemotherapy, ” which is“ having some effect, ” but does not cure.
"Sometimes there will be someone who will survive lung cancer," Treasure says.
But in the end, they're all going to die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The author, Stephen Jay Gould, died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After the mesothelioma was discovered, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and consultant for the equally disabled.
When they called, he happily introduced himself, “Hello, you have reached the cancer center. ”
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
His illness was diagnosed four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last for four months, and probably only extend his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “has been able to show things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Loic Lang-Lazduski from the breast surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a claim, and they'd have to approve his payment.
For patients with mesothelioma, the question of money is crucial.
But when different treatments eventually fail inevitably, many patients face further financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small amount could pose a health risk.
And here we are faced with the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled down, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, following the investigation of the case, spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the asbestos in the criminalized interior was removed in the 1990s.”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Recruiting exposure of fatal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after this happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or failed.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who now defend themselves with accusations have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been approved this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek redress, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The law created a 350 million-dollar reserve, which is built by insurance companies and which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally charge them as compensation - approximately £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
“It’s an agreement signed by insurance companies,” says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if the time and the mesothelioma people were able to track down former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps. ”
But Penning and Morgan admit that given the seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People are too suffering and need help right away," Penning said last December during a second reading of the mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following initial consultations, Lang-Lazdun surgery was recommended, which, unlike Tom Treasura, thought had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - three treatments in which Lang-Lazdunski may boast survival rates of five years up to 40% of patients.
Abbott's strengthened it.
"Of course, this is not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott undertook the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Checkpoints showed no signs of illness.
I went to another checkup in March [2014].
I had several stains in my chest [cancer].
My 50th birthday just came in.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott went back to six cycles of chemo.
There are currently no signs of tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how the boiler alarm works.
If you hear the bad news, you'll start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly we got a lot of people calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such conversations.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not limited to hope or only a sign of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) an unhappily certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, “mesotheliom does not threaten life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the growing debate on democratic reform Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow the Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began organizing and preparing only hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not surprise us, but it made us angry," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause “chaos”.
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong management to China, Beijing promises that beginning in 2017, residents will be able to elect executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decisions as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows for a direct vote, but it also makes clear that Chinese leaders hold the committee's nomination process firmly in hand, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after summer months, which recorded some of the biggest and most followed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong cost the movement of the occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial quarter unless Beijing gave them general voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks, the wave of protests would start.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as a last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all the options for dialogue have been exhausted, and the establishment of the Centre is inevitable.
In Hong Kong, the authorities prepared for Beijing's announcement all day and on Sunday strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and placed policemen and barricades.
Inciting unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from land increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also growing fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are an increasing pressure from Beijing bending.
Some people criticise the occupation movement of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the rescue boat of Hong Kong.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage, depending on how many people participate and how long," says political Regina Ip, who has long been criticizing the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
Also in recent days, the Chinese state media has come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong draw as subversive agents controlled by the West.
During the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which reached 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the biggest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
Voterist?
The League in Jihlava bears the name according to the political movement
There are approximately 1,600 amateur athletes playing a small dig in the Vysočina region.
And their highest competition is called together for the Jihlava League.
The name is based on one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
Plus, ten on his candidate is the boss of the little kick in Jihlava, Jan Mrák.
"There was a general crowd where there was no problem with it," said Mrák.
The situation around the first league of small dignitaries has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended a change in the grant distribution system.
The little digger got a million crowns on the city's website last year.
Even this year, it's hundreds of thousands.
According to law, the procedure of small diggers is not contrary to either the law or the master's directives.
However, the situation is for the Authority to step up the rules on grant allocation and subsidies," said the spokesman for the Master's Department, Radek Tulis.
Taking subsidies from the city and expressing it as a small kick-ass support in the elections of one political party, I don't think that's gonna work anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to high-level football.
That the CzechSSD should be a regional takeover, ODS Division or KDU-ČSL 1.
What about class competitions and stuff?
I wouldn't do that.
On the contrary, I would like to see the sponsors from a number of companies turn to us," noted the chairman of the Regional Football Union, Miroslav Vrzaček.
The head of the small football on the other side and the movement in the name of the league does not let go
According to players, small kicks would deserve this sport in Jihlava with six playgrounds, wardrobes and social facilities.
"For example, the playground is not ours at the Stoupes, we are in a rental," Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club warned.
The most suitable site would be the Czech Mill.
For example, in my opinion, there will be a pointless space for skaters, who are about 50 in Jihlava," Mrák warned.
The Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small mine uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and On Stoupy, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have maximum use.
We plan to upgrade or build sports sites in schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that for a small dig there has been enormous progress in recent years," he added.
Other political parties in league names do not appear according to John Mark.
We have limitations.
If someone in one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other there anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said the councilman for sport Karel Voldán.
"But whether the electorate is using the Small Kicker's Society and the grant of the city for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including private jets or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service had its own security page.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to seeing our VIF (very important frescher - a very important fresher) variants this year to ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
The speaking society said that since the services had only just begun, they had no reservations yet, but added: “The students will start making reservations in the next few weeks. ”
The company also stated that while students pay £9,000 a year for schooling, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today students are different about expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIP program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunnová, vice president of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who attend university this month need to cope with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep pace with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists rebel against racism and police after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, he killed an officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for a funeral with their hands on their backs are chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a shift in the online discussions of white women.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white female feminists prefer sex over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the white male response concentrates 100% on race.
Compared to the reaction of blacks shortly after 9 August, personal articles with headlines such as “thinking a white man over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not only about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at such a level," she said.
People felt that what had happened must be said.
For the crisis we are facing, it is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially won that they had to draw attention to it.
According to an English professor at the State University of Ohia Koritha Mitchellov, Ferguson brought to light problems that African Americans have to face every day and that are not perceived as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories from my partner's life on Facebook and get 150 characters from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about baroes being trapped in their own country, it's quiet deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who were dealing with race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no between race and sex dichotomia.
According to her, the blacks could not have shared these problems with luxury: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today combine the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's questions and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white women rape," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white men.
According to Hattery, the gap between white women and black women came when a fighter for election law like Susan B. Anthony examined the lands at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of women or blacks could have election rights.
"They decided to bet cards on women's voting rights and on the right for blacks to focus later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we'll get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for women to organize against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was created 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the white feminist response to the issues raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to ‘ catch up’ with the issues that the blacks faced for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell filed.
The second wave of feminists who have made their career a struggle for reproductive law and access to contraception are now exploring what it means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinemova took the attack on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian who demanded that the white Americans protest racism more widely.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and opinions on race, which differ greatly in public opinion surveys - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinemová advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and sex, her comments on the question of race in America are a matter for some people.
A specialist from the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book “Who Stolen Feminism?” said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young baroeans, are “more vulnerable than their sisters”, but Steinem’s remarks on the Ferguson site face a criticism that she had earlier raised.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but hardly any for boys.
But when the White House launched a little program called My Brother's Keeper, which was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused a lot of feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The attitude of the police towards the Black Community is not the only problem that comes to the fore in the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youth in the southwest this year, the question of reforming immigration laws came up again - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organisation mobilising women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order for the question to be presented as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them will be placed in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.
The place of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The Realtor removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, it rested on it in a pig's living room.
A one-bedroom separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private trip to Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the sofa of the pig.
The Realtor Connells said that the pig in the photo is a pet of the owners.
"The photo was mistaken, and that is why it has already been removed," the spokeswoman said.
In the property information, Connells’s former prayer office described the former prayer as “an isolated one-bedroom house. ”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a city in the southwest of the fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in southeastern Perth, and one lucky guy takes $1.1 million home from Saturday's lottery haul.
The traffic in Harvey was already five years old, and the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
A happy winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city in Southwest Perth.
It's the main topic and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia divided one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and only a few weeks earlier a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple have been betting for 20 years and said that winning will allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th largest lottery winner in West Australia this year, totaling 85 million dollars.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers Want Higher Wages
In a press release, GDL identified the protest as a warning strike, for which he purposely chose time outside the traffic peak.
The chosen time of strike is taken into account by the GDL to many people who return from the weekend to the railway during the first working day.
At the same time we think of people arriving for work during the day," the union said on Monday morning in a press release to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should mainly affect freight, less passengers," added GDL.
The DB's official response to the strike announcement has not yet been published.
It is not even clear how the protest action touches international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The boards require a five percent increase in driver's wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average wage of drivers varies depending on the years spent between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to enter into salary growth while reducing working hours.
They stress that the driver’s wage assessment must be developed in the same way as other railway personnel, for whom DBs are not counted by the week’s cut-off.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at Barum rallye.
What exactly happened?
It was a flaw in the material.
The car was brand new, so I didn't think anything like it could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been properly repaired and continued at a slower pace for the service, where would the mechanics have replaced it?
If we were to go there straight, yes.
But there were two more heresies waiting for us, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the wine.
Everything was caused by the fact that we'd been touching the car for over six months to be on some level.
The race showed we did it.
You ran it so you could actually think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
Work didn't come in vain.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barrumka.
I'm afraid the tech said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who dropped out of the championship fight early.
They fell out of it and the foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
Especially for spectators, it was a shame because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, which you are preparing for the car, has been moving for a long time in the peak.
But he paid for his flight out of the line and gained almost a two - minute manca.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the levels of the winners.
I mean, he was driving the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He was very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant in rally races?
Not at this point, I'm sure.
Last year I said Barrumka was my last race, and I still didn't.
I've decided to take her again.
It was my 19th launch here, and if there's another chance in a year, I guess I'll do it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy that?
To some extent, we started just because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or strangers, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What do you have in store for Barumac?
Team's moving on.
Next week we'll go to Vyshkov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much around here.
Plus, he wants to borrow Honz Sykoro's Fabia from us at this race.
Mira and I have a European twofold in Switzerland and Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you indicate anything yet?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Korsica rally was part of the world championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the show.
Doesn't he get you to try the tracks again?
He doesn't.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been allowed to issue a certificate of incapacity from your doctor, which serves as proof to the organisation that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer.
After that, the agreement was made that the days would be recorded as vacations, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require that the employer's consent to the leave be confirmed in writing, this procedure has been proven in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the use of leave, as in your case, may be suspended and absent from work, as a long-term unpaid absence, so the reason for the immediate abolition of the employment ratio under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a legal dispute with your employer, you thus lack evidence to prove it.
The working relationship with you has not been abolished according to § 53, you only have the given days listed in the bill as an unforgivable absolution.
The unforgivable absence in the score sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to obtain material security in unemployment), but it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there has actually been an injury, which has led to your inability to work (this is not the so-called "incompensation", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the presentation of a written medical certificate of incapacity, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to receive the leave.
So you avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track.
Returning to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little after the Atlanta Motor Speedway race track.
Stewart ran into the castle the second time after his right front tire broke in 172.
Stewart drove a wrecked car into the garage, didn't give reporters a word and left.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that Car 14 is disappointed, but he will now focus on the Richmond race in Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We're gonna go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart ran into the castle for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Bush, which demanded repair of the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good ending until today's race," Johnston said, adding, "it didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, he missed Stewart three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and he needed to win either a race in Atlanta or a subsequent race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into a tragic accident in which a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, which led Stewart to a race.
The authorities said that investigating the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion had a warm cheering before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked at 10th and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 he got out of control, came out of the second corner, and ran into Stewart, which sent both cars to the castle.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi controller, earns 12.3 million
Prague completed the tender for the new taxi service post administrator.
For 103 parking stands, it will receive approximately 12.3 million crowns per year.
Until recently, 150,000 crowns were collected annually for the same taxi driver’s seats.
Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09) informed of this.
Back in the day, the city used draw to select administrators.
The winner then obtained a flat-rate rent of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
At the present time, the above offers are decided.
"The year since the cancellation of the original lease contracts and the opening of the tendering procedure has proved that the new rental system is far more favourable and generally fairer for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive spot is Na Pershtýn
The highest price was offered by the applicants for a location on Na Perštýn street.
They'll pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the General House or at the Václav Square.
The Council adopted new rules on rentals of taxi stations in autumn 2012 and in summer last year the original lease agreements were declared.
The selection procedure was held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 sites.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We released her every time, creating the second pond near the cabin.
Then we poured Savo there.
It's an incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar has always provided enough delicious scented water.
And it wasn't ever done professionally, but Grandpa did it with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three crucifixes and generally self-loathing, like everything else on the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, we thought the water didn't smell right.
We were wondering if there was anything missing.
In the place where the pump was going through, it was possible for a little bit of bad luck, there was a plate quite unslept, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that it was moving a brick.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we illuminated it to the bottom.
So we let her go again and we cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seals around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a glued package on the ground with some bones.
That's what it looked like.
And another one.
Now it looked like a dazed mouse.
At the ceiling, where there are holes, Grandpa's invention, there were fish leftovers!
And hard to eat!
Our basement's self-inflicted, too.
Someone'd say Grandpa just buried the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only smothered sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
They're used to ships.
And the car.
And a cot on the beach.
The door with wide spaces was usually open, as someone walked there in one piece.
There are several holes on the ceiling that have already been mentioned.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
There's no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to work, and that's it.
But now the luft didn't even help.
He smelled the whole cellar.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also fired things that were around: boards, heraclita boards, and so on.
Our remote cabin was welcomed by a disinfectant blanket.
We were wondering who might have dragged the disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here all.
It wouldn't be easy for her to come to our place.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
If he didn't blow Franta's guts out there?
It's practically been here all year, stupid ideas, it's him.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and to check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
One day we heard our wife's anxious bark.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The chain leaped over her, and she was pouting like a fool.
Her mom took it out because she thought Réza was picking up a garbage hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially wrapped in a clubhouse and partially straightened out.
There's a soot on the balcony.
The line got a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The bubble, long over a metre and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza was defending her.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When we saw too much of our whole family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and she went through the door into the basement.
We followed her.
She jumped for the well as a flash.
By the way, we recorded another smelling package on her board.
Smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shaky.
And that's what we've been locking up the basement for days.
That...
We went out, and we all fell for one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's a mess at the well.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on its neck appeared.
And then she hopped up on the well, and she's got a whole thing going on.
She wrapped herself around a pump and started digging in.
The fired employee got revenge, bought notebooks on the company, and sold them.
A corrupt employee bought a computer company after his release and then sold it.
He was able to spend his money before the police were arrested.
In a short period of time, a man bought 16 computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after takeover took them to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," Chief Commissioner Rostislav Brückner said.
The motive of fraud was revenge on the employer for release and also profiting money.
"In interrogation, he claimed that he used money to pay off loans," Brückner said.
The police also found out that the fraud is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
Money could have also ended up in winning instruments or in video-lotterial terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money at his place," the Commissioner said.
A con man who has already been convicted of theft is now in danger of being in prison for a year or five years.
So far, the police have not told us whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars who bought the notebooks at the price and sold them.
"It is true that they were picking up brand-new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it or how much fun I've had in Run Prague.
This year, the organizers have prepared some changes for us.
The biggest change was the route that led to the flood rather than lead back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit on the other side.
With the entire team, we decided to treat our readers personally on the stand, where we took photos together and made videos.
To get my perspective from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
Along with my friend Katya, we obediently entered the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes before we started.
We greeted friends who passed us into the faster runners sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
The screams of brightness, but instead of a quick start, the cupping to the starting line followed.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, we turn the measurements off, and we run at ten o'clock.
We intertwine with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, all the fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky provides a view of Vyšehrad almost to a wheezy breath.
The pulsating flesh running along the coast seems to be running all of Prague.
On the coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre is traditionally beginning to show who has the strength.
A light hill on the Palace Square makes many runners slow down or walk.
I see a police escort just before I move to the Theatre and immediately follow Visek Pavlište at an incredible pace to the finish.
I can hear the delightfully puffed-out sighs of other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the line, I'm encouraging him, he's going to slap me, but right before that, my leg's going to spin, and our hands are going to drop.
The rally of Theatre Street gives you a chance to take a short break and breathe.
We need places where my eyes can breathe.
The island on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
There's a moment of truth at the first refreshment.
During the crossing of the road Kátá will pounce on the curb and perform the jump in a gliding way.
I'm seeing if she doesn't need help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues with Goat Street, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there is no longer such crowd, yet there is a need to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I still have no idea that the concept of the southernmost place will get its true meaning later.
Tourists and friends of other runners are frantically encouraging us at the Dust Gate.
I'm trying to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata too, because ten clapping fans is like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen pretty badly, now we're running a race.
We run tens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words, "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one's running ahead of us at the last refreshment. We're moving up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
They're gonna hurt for three miles to the target, but we really need to get out of here.
The sun is slowly setting, and the end of the day symbolically ends the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn, and just a straight line to the finish line.
The tempo we're running to, I'm surprised where it comes from in that girl?
"Come on, let's go under 13 o'clock, let's go!" I call.
We're trying, we're printing, and there's a target.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set the limit for an hour and a half.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
I'm helping her with the railing where she's resting for a while.
There is exhaustion, but also happiness from well - done performance.
After a while, I'm taking her out of target area.
Euphoria won't let us think about the pressure in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that goat's alley wasn't the worst place.
That's what's here to target a flood that's under pressure from almost ten thousand runners to crack.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for them.
I'm losing my head after a while, too, and I'm wondering if the wonderful views and the more interesting route over the last few years were what was happening in the finish line.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people are added to this, the rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere in the Yellow Baths moved between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators graduated on every meter of track.
Unfortunately, the historical centre must count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place that is on the one hand reserved by the wall and the other by the river to be the best solution.
If I tell myself that the race has ended by pursuing a goal, I value it as a very guided race.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end everything was going well.
Write to us in the discussion whether you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the finish line.
Bulgarian Prison Supervisors Organise Protests
Hundreds of prison staff in all of Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest assembly before the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand to reintroduce the original working conditions that have changed recently.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov, includes higher salaries.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although the prison supervisors and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) was informed.
"The meetings are still ongoing," said BNR Head of the Directorate General of Prison Services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Professional Workers' Organisations in the Ministry of Interior are expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physicists don't usually write best sellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University managed to hit black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate into the thickening of the problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is, of course, that the search for a unified physics theory is not a boring story.
The physical fundamental problem between the two key theories (although at this time our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solves such ideas that it is worth retelling and laikas.
In addition, Greene advised so much fresh and neatly that he could not calculate how much interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he made his "miss" most of the time in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and the Hidden Reality.
Obviously, neither the author would object if his book was faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe provides almost everything that an informed layman with ambition should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will only be a little bit more lively (because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Greene's non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Still, it is specific and fully acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more ground-based, specifically a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you pull a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the entire scenario from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily record a long horizontal stretch of stretched hose, but if you do not currently suffer from clearness, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given your great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which you can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will only answer it with one information: the distance of an ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're trying to say is that a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object from a half-mile distance.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we increase everything, we see a sudden second dimension, in the shape of a circle that opens a hose.
In such an increased view, it is obvious that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well known left-right dimension along the hose length, but also in the "dimensional in/again direction of movement of hourly handles", that is, around the circular hose cross-section.
You're beginning to understand that to determine the position of the small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle wrapping the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (cf. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the breaking theory of string.
Unbreakable aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and bent.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the converging hose circuit is short, "rolled" and worse known.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better distinction.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they split into two groups.
They can either be large, vast, and therefore directly visible, or rather small, bent and much worse observable.
Of course, in the above case, we did not just advance to reveal the "scrolled" dimension of the thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help yourself.
But if the hose were thinner - like hair or capillary - we would only reveal the bent dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he issued with an overwhelming thought that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of us known.
Kaluza’s radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be introduced into a single, unified concept structure.
The question immediately arises how this Kaluz observation goes along with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he made clear and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have as large as the warped dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimension in the direction of the hose length, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have an additional dimension, firmly bent into such a small space that it has so far remained hidden from our most advanced experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense series of circles on the hose circuit.
From the looks of a hose, it's still a thin one-dimensional line.
With far-reaching vision now, the drawing will reveal the bent dimension even more easily, as we will see the motive in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together with four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations, let us notice illustrations on Figure 3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we have increased the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (we see them at level four) if they are bent into a sufficiently small space; thus, we explain that we have not yet seen them directly.
The square grid depicts the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle is a new, tiny and bent dimension.
Just like the loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - we only applied them to the intersections in the square grid because of the view.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of the space - the common world around us - on normal scales such as the meters represented by the side of the small square in the square grid.
In each of the following pictures, we will focus on the small area of the previous picture; we will increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at several of the first levels of expansion.
But if we follow the microscopic properties of space geometry further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we see a sudden new one, in the shape of a circular bent dimension, similar to a loop, or in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at every place in the direction of large dimensions, as well as the hose circular circuit at each point of its length.
For the sake of interest, we only covered the circular dimension in some, regularly placed points.
Figure 4 Kaluzov and Klein's image of the microscopic structure of the geometry of the space is summarized.
Similarity with hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (from which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large size.
Even more important, the difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular pig-shaped dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as circular hose - much harder than to observe obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is sufficiently small, it will in fact reveal it beyond the strengths of our most modern instruments for enlargement.
Most important, however, is that the additional dimension is not just a hollow hump within normal dimensions, as a two-dimensional illustration suggests mistakenly.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point in three common dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-down, left-to-right and forward-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A fairly small ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, except for the three common other positions in the circular dimension; if we are counting time, then data five, in any case one more than we normally would expect.

The price for e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, it shows Kaluzo and Klein's thinking that it is not excluded from the existence of additional bent dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with a single eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billion meters.
A smaller bent dimension can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with a few ideas from just being born quantum mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could have about one Planck's length, that is, far beyond today's discriminating capabilities.
Since then, physics has called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions of Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wojig Honza Homola advises how to exercise on electric guitar: 5.
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists of a twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can repetitive by any means.
Whoever melts in music theory finds its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honz Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and a puppet guide whose facebook profile can be monitored here, since graduation 20 years ago, they live as a graph.
He's the guitarist of the Vojit band, which, unfortunately, he can't leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as is Brother Matthew, leader of the Vohhe.
Start with training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is on you alone, you can think of anything, just apply it to the harmonious model of the twelve," Honza advises.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza with a twelve-piece harmony on two strings and how pretty it's starting to sound.
If you add the third string, you can already flirt with the tunes of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, look out for the change in the alignment, Honza points out in the video.
Next time Honza comes back to the pentatonics and you try to put her together with exactly 12 of them.
Then practice it honestly.
As best you can read it in a conversation with Jane Homolo at the first lesson of his school game on electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, he recognizes the castle Dvořák
We take the point and we're happy for it.
The first half of the time we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored out of a penalty kick.
You weren't nervous about playing him, were you?
Somehow I didn't notice it, even though at the second goal where the local fans are, it would probably be worse.
You settled the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the penalty score after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it came out of the corner, and then it was a penalty.
You got up after her, and for the first half, you were a better team with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the scored goal we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep it at a pace, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that at home they said something about a break to their game, perhaps they were not very happy with it.
You've only scored for the first time on the rival field, but maybe you haven't even scored a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I don't think that's such a difference, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Pilsen, that's another category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, didn't you fear that after the last game it might be similar?
No, of course not, but of course we are glad that we do not have to talk about waiting for a goal since the last match.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still three in six games, which is not yet for the big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a mile away crater.
The lava that flies to the surface in the Holugraun area near Vatnajökull's glacier flows through the underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It's under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruptions of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
Scientists, however, fear that a lava tunnel could open up even in places under the ice.
If this were to happen, it would mean massive floods, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum River and on other rivers, with the same intensity as the current eruptions.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulphur, clouds of steam and gas rise from the crack.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case in the case of eruption at Fimvördjuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also a lot more gas," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
Since yesterday, however, the weather has improved considerably, with almost no wind in the early hours.
The trails of the sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange degree (second highest) for Bárđarbung and yellow (third) for Askju applies.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She went by the wings.
A flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced by Peggy Valentine, an acrobat, who climbed from the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the two-planet and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place this year on the fifth day, and again the organizers managed to prepare some interesting aerial items.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on wings" in the administration of the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft aircraft 18.
He pulled attention to himself by his glowing stroke.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking come from the United States.
After World War I, he tried to enforce many former war pilots.
But because of the large number of fatalities, he was banned.
Today, however, they are slowly returning to the airtime program.
Peggy comes out of the cockpit on the top wing after she starts.
It's where he's doing all sorts of exercises.
At the end of the performance it will move into the space between the wings of the aeroplane, where its show continues," said Ludík Matějíček from the Chebian Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy’s performance was the main feature of the program, then the following performance by the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with Grippeny the Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (called the numbers).
Such a composition could be seen by flying fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský showed everyone the breath of taking acrobatics with an airplane from 1945.
He was made in the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in the military reserve.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Castle.
Also on the same spot is another pearl of Chile's Air Day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditionor.
At the airport, he didn't go to the airport to overlook a powerful machine.
His polished aluminum cover was glowing far away.
He also earned a Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colours of the French Air Force.
A small passenger plane jumped behind a rejected Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from the German Hofu on an air day.
German neighbours presented themselves in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft both 18T or a three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann's two-planets.
Lucie Borgy: Dramatic Return in front of the camera!
Parental concerns have been exchanged by Lucie Borgy at least for tonight for her work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was fine with modern television reports, as if she hadn’t stopped for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blondes ended six weeks, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not be regularly shown in TV Nova's main news coverage.
Regulatory return is expected according to Blesk.cz information for up to a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borgy went back to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
A year's exhibition in Prague?
She'd sell herself out, she'd be planning a bachelorette party.
It would be dignified if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will stand up to it," said Jihlava after a show with the name of the Golden Match, in which once again a stunning Nagan team met.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be nice to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can find one or two days during the tournament, when it's completely free and where such a game could be mixed.
We'll tell this to Gum (Jiří Šlegrovi) or Beda Ščerban (the organizer of the jilovski match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play New Jersey playoff?
Well, if I come in like that...
You don't want to play in the team.
Or did the Devil’s meeting somehow change your mind?
The representation and exhibitional match are two different things and the representation is the decisive performance.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the world championship.
That's where players who have a good name should go, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed a bit.
How did you actually enjoy that naganic reunion?
It's just that meeting with the players was great.
A man brought back stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for hockey players.
But the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which is really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Rose and Petr Čechmanek on the change.
Do you still remember your first game of representation?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, came into one threesome.
It was the first representation start for all of us.
But to dominate in some way, you can't say that.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hasek was caught for a long time.
What did you say to his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticized Jagra for the reasons he decided to end up in the team).
And the Engine did a great show.
While he was training with me once in the night, he was mean.
And now he's got it pretty good.
First the US and then the Netherlands, football players begin to qualify.
On Monday morning, prominent guests flocked to the mixed NH Hotel.
People could have seen maybe Peter Czech's goalkeeper from Chelsea, Paul Vrbo's representative coach...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The publisher of Arsenal and the captain of the team arrived at a meeting of about half a dozen among the last.
We have a wonderful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he was already in front of the press.
Czech representation programme
Monday September 1st: start of the crash, first training
Tuesday September 2nd: Fan Training (18:30, Summer) Autogramiad (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) End of the reunion
Russian and Spol. can support fans even before the middle match against the US (20:15).
The representative opened Tuesday training for them, starting at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autographation that will not be missed by Rosický or Bohemia.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more peaceful.
Which is praised by Coach Vrba, who has just complained about a number of social events in spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been done so far," praised Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
When entering the new qualification cycle, the Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image.
The representation has three matches, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she emigrated 2:2 and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
Not until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the Europe 2016 championship procedure.
Of course, it would help the Czech men if the General against the United States could do the same.
It was the first half of the year we met.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Willow agreed.
The only player in the 30-member nomination who has health problems is David Lafat.
He's suffering from fever.
If he couldn't get better in the middle of a game against the U.S., Coach Willow would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how after a bad diagnosis she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teens believing that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The Charity Organization of CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is common among CMT people, as the disease is known very little.
In the United Kingdom, it is believed that approximately 23,000 people suffer from CMT, which may present symptoms in the field of motor skills such as muscle weakness, motionless walking, and twisted toes.
In the case of the affected, there may also be numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that in the course of time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought he was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be chained to a wheelchair and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride skates with other kids or skateboarding, and I was bullied at school by the way I went and ran."
When Rogers was thirteen and she was after several operations to release her Achilles' feet and straighten out her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and she looked into her documentation, where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was following, and I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the Association FA," he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I panicked completely.
I thought before I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my skills.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or you’d be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something much less dangerous."
After a few genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a lucky child," she declared.
The Charity Organisation of CMT UK has launched a month of information on CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Investors in Washington: Taxes are taxed with the return of the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation by companies in the country with the acceleration of recovery last year slightly increased and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesspeople in Maryland and Virginia totalled $27.6 billion for fiscal year 2013 to state and local treasury, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - both state and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and it was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the Centre on State Taxation political group, the state tax rate rose by 4.3% faster than the local drains by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56 %, are from commercial taxes, and 36 % of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows proportionally the smallest corporate tax revenue.
Researchers argue that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of property belonging to companies, which increased the real estate tax this year after three consecutive years of growth -1% by 3.7%.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion last year on state and local real estate taxes, which, compared to 9.6 billion in 2012, represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax represents less than one-fifth of corporate tax.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax is almost half of government and local tax.
“In Maryland he owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that does not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely a lot more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
A recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to a recovering real estate market.
According to data, business revenue appears to be increasing as well.
Companies in the region published a tax on corporate income of 2.3 billion dollars, which rose from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland picked one billion dollars from corporate income taxes, most in the region.
Even though they are taking the same course, the local corporate tax burden does not grow as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the increase in taxation on average, to 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest income tax of all three districts (of which all have the same taxation) of companies, 6 %.
The tax rate of the companies in Maryland is 8.25 % while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study by the American Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will fall to 5% next year.
If the State continues to meet the income targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of taxation of income could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small business in Washington is doing better, and higher state and local taxes are therefore being paid.
Food tax collected by small businesses as a personal income tax - the compensation structure of increasing costs by increasing prices, according to which most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and national increase in trade taxes will likely continue next year, the total sales tax revenue for both state and local governments will increase by 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014 last year.
However, Washington may be behind others because the reduction of state expenditure is taking its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putinov Novorusko and Lafat’s scissors will be the boss of Europe
Will a new state arise in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support provided by the West for the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kiev, so he cannot tell when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic requires the right to disagree with part of it
The European Commission, together with diplomats within a week, is to propose the form of a further approval of the anti-Russian sanctions, decided tonight for the EU summit.
This was told by the permanent chairman of the Herman Van Rompuy meetings of the Member States.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to shift the form of sanctions are due to be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new president of the Union.
Van Rompuy will replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union summit to preside over the European Council, the so-called EU President who runs the top meetings of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
European diplomacy is headed by Catherine Ashton, Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assistanced death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only not talked about it
Helping an incurable and long-term suffering patient with a life-saver?
In Czech conditions where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is legally not possible.
However, the comments made by the doctors who addressed LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis

But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motel neurologist.
It's about knowing the CIA manuscript, needing a war, writes Huml about shooting down the MH17 flight.
Ambassador to the CzechSSD Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, "the severe sanctions imposed on the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it's also the CIA's handwriting.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are offering again the impossible
The end of the homeless in the streets, parking for every family and cable above Prague.
It is repeated before each election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with upcoming municipal elections, politicians are getting ahead of who prefers voters.
The Lidovka.cz server chose unfulfilled promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovakians landed at Dunkerque.
The Leaning Begins
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak separate brigade moved to France.
Her commander, Alois Liška, has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally met and placed this ground force as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

Joan Rivers' family: "We're holding fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to the New York City hospital, but her daughter today expressed the hope that a 1 8 - year - old comedian would recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding on to her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for a rescue service, according to which there was a cardiac arrest at the Yorkville Endoscopy in Upper East Side, according to a source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions did not last long, including unreal support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a twisted title
That the media misrepresents reality with their subtitles, there is (unfortunately) no news.
I know the headlines "seller" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, it's more like a word of anger.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the firing rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared truce.
That's when the headline "both sides have broken the truce" comes out.
Does the journalist community realize that they are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are increasing throughout Europe (and not just there)?
Sixty years have not passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shaw.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the password "Jewish pig" and similar credulity, it struck me.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were destined to destroy the Slavana?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please give a little more care to your work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as it's here.
And also defend the right of a truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would destroy and the Czech Republic would wipe out the world map?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them, why don't they go to Gaza, say, why would they do that?
In Israel they have a job, social security and top health care (I have seen the Arabs go to the top of the private hospital Hadassa, which is financed by the donor gifts of Jews from around the world, and they are, of course, treated there).
Hamas also attacks their Arab brothers with their arrows.
The only real aid to Gaza, including this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm him.
And not judge Israel, not directly in the titles.
Inform Hamas' practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas is to eliminate the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform us that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area may have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, which, however, is not paid by Gaza’s administrators and even angers that supplies of electricity are sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate Israel’s territory, but, perhaps, to build houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the statement Information Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying $1.04 billion ($970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement triggered a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, Twitche Google's sale looked certain for one billion, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, who only three years ago founded Justin.tv, had been tuned to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts from games - by Business Insider “YouTube for Lively Transmitted Playing”.
The interface of Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos of “Let's play”, a species where wisers (most of the older ones) give a game of processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube, when describing Twitche, comes to a great deal of stress, so the news that YouTube buys Twitch, which didn't upset anyone very much, was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have now is CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because we believe in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster.”
The next mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about it, games instead of real playing just to observe.
One thing is to watch a friend across his shoulder at three in the morning, as resident Evil plays, and another thing is to watch someone stranger get 20 hits in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from player's perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control yourself is a pretty good recipe to get a headache.
I admit that games like speed run, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn't the master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of the Internet.
How exactly does Amazon use this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it used to be, you know, swallowing YouTube.
Twitch has something that every firm would like to attract: the hordes of young men the advertisers want.
As Twitche Shear, Amazon, and Twitch said, “believe in the future of the game,” and the media don’t seem to be scalding, nor do they seem to be a crowd.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist blogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Letters Are God's Word."
The original video was attached.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that is contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Who will you trust?
The supposed word of God, or the word of man?
It's like human research is completely insignificant compared to the authority that they imagine it has their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God to those who are written down.
If there really is an intelligent creator for some purpose, it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and he must be the one who added a series of additional evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can tell stories, they can tell stories.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listening to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no more gods.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letter.
It would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors would not be able to measure such a work.
And people wouldn't have to believe her blindly because she would be consistent, based on credible and true evidence, and would manifest deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
Persist would inspire every reader to unit of shared faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything smaller.
But what we see instead is the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, searching for the controversial truths, and in some ways each one is entitled to God’s guidance, regardless of continuing running and separating in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, the Bahá'u'llah Kitab-i-Akdas, the Zarathustras Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharatian Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormons, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the members of the believers each of them say that the others are on the path.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the path to some degree.
None of the above-mentioned books is of any benefit to others.
None of them have evidence resistance and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology (protection) because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So you can't claim to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote gross atrocities instead of morals, and many of them claim to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - each one may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudices of politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it denial, more like mutual comments.
We need to point out once again that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
She's right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of Moses and Moses do not attribute the authorship to any of them, since it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by doctrines and ebionages and their entirely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups as Luciferians were spread and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these regulations applies to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to young Moses ’ religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to Belzebub "The Lord of Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what happened in the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of committee decisions at the temple in Nikaji.
The four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple lifting of hands, as if the fact of some things had been allowed to be accepted or refused by a vote.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers at that time.
What was read on Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually, they found that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And that's how the canon core evolved from the core of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that revolved among the uneducated masses at that time.
Yet, they also deliberately removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are not even available anymore?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this random mix of reputations, parables, and psalm lyrics?
Surely the Bible was written by humans and certainly not too much enlightenment, rather the contrary!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically wrong, almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believe snakes and donkeys can talk, believe in curses, bloody victims, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought using a magic rod to give someone blood would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who think rabbits are ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and drink that's a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow the tended patterns, they would give birth to the tended calves.
How could anyone say that who knows anything about genetics?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If she were from a pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then she would not contain any of the things that she contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written down by uneducated and large-scale savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their Web sites admit that if any reality contradicts the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
There's the same thing in their world.
It is ironic that they reject God's "work" as "worship of creation instead of creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the turning back of their supposedly "holy" books somehow provokes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creativeistic Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and at the same time the Bible could be wrong because it cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they're his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified and often also deliberately altered and twisted by just missing people.

An attacker at a Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of them died
A man named Chechnya, according to the New China Agency, forcibly entered the elementary school building in the morning and attacked about half an 11th local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chechnya later killed himself with a high jump, according to the New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.

As of 1 September, David Fiala became the new director of Nova’s news and publicity.
He will replace Alan Zárubu, who has been leading the creative department of Nova since 1 June.
David Fiala had previously worked in the graphic department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, Alan Záruba has been involved in the realization of the complete visual transformation of television news broadcasts, Strepiny, Dust! and other publicist shows of Nova TV.
David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between the editors, the study board and the graphic department, which is the essence of art director's work.
He has a sense of typography and clean elegant design, which is the way we want to follow in the vision of Nova reporting,” says the creative director of Nova Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly succumbed to hackers, naked celebrity shots got to the public
Screenshot of the image showing the missing files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com noted.
They reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users recorded them by automatically backing up images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
A part of the celebrity rejects the images as forged, but several of the images have already been admitted.
Among them is actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her cover role as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
American magazines reportedly showed interest, according to reports on the 4chan server, but hacker wants more money than the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely indeed a weakness in iCloud security.
The GitHub server had an instrument on GitHub two days ago that allowed it to obtain passwords for user accounts through rough power, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool worked well, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the publication of this instrument.
iCloud users should therefore change their Apple ID password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
Escape of naked pictures of celebrities consider to be a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, they are more secure than computers in households or smaller companies, they upload sensitive photos in an unprotected form of unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos or any other sensitive content on-line, encrypt files before upload.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup photos from the phone to take place only on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move the sensitive images in time to safety, and especially you will have the space to delete the unmanned images, so they will not waste any space in the online storage.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet to HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valáška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for a college script
Since the price for a university script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, a new second-year student with a smart way to reduce costs came in.
He invented a system of lending books from high school students with the offer of nominal compensation to delay their resold.
“The book on calculations, which normally costs $180, I won for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options on how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroederova.
On the rise there is lending textbooks, which allows students to use a semester book, often with a significant discount rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookstores in campuses, says that lending books has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the department shows that around a quarter of the books in university libraries were loaned last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased according to the National Association of University Trades in University Bookstores.
There are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower online than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it is possible to buy it on the Internet at Chegg.com, a textbook-specialized retail store, for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or the wear and tear, the teaching texts used are appropriate.
At Chegg.com, Calculus sells for $93.49.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Underground The Business End Of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
New guy was selling himself for $48.
University instructor Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students at their teachers check whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work at seminars are not important.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the final price.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Borrowing
Also worth considering are borrowed textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow about $20 for the entire semester.
Meet the terms of the trade in which you borrow your book, including the strike for notes, emphasis or wear and damage.
Remember: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide instead of a normal book of e-books.
Sometimes these books are essentially loaned in the form of an electronic licence valid for a period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends Calculus for six months for approximately $61.
According to the Braceys, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends following ISBN because it ensures that you buy the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it is really in stock, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.
It's just mud.
And then they found guns in the well from the end of the war.
That well is standing just a block from St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around, and we started pulling out an airtight load -- roughly a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we were approaching the fickle day, we hit the head," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled her out, cleaned her up, and found out that it was an attack ring of German rifles used by SS units.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novak added.
All wooden structural objects have disintegrated in time, so it is useless.
Her body, of course, is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How'd it go in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe she was dumped by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being moved.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't have done it.
They were dumping guns in the woods," the finder thought.
The rifle was the only thing they found in the well of the Ghost of Jeseníks.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully digested the mud so that there were no accidents, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The find ends in a museum depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated captured Bohemia
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - "Sorry, I have to take this... they're calling me from Donetsk," he apologized about eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktual.cz Ukrainian Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also director of the Centre for Liberation of Prisoners of War.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
During any such interruption, it was not possible to ignore the names of the people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban makes out with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"This will be it - drive there," he concluded one of the brilliant discussions with Doneck and again dedicated himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is the general in reserve, former fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to forty-two hours a day.
Currently.cz: Perhaps you know that Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their count to 30.
There can be many more, of course.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swedes, Georgians... but not yet Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured native and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, fighting in the Ukrainian banners of volunteers and separatists, they will be captured, they will be shot without mercy, just as any other foreigner will.
Separatists consider these men to be hired soldiers, and they feel that they deserve nothing but death.
However, if Ukrainian soldiers, for example, occupy a group of female separatists - including the Czech Republic - they sit him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's gonna make it.
The Ukrainian side behaves in war as a state.
A.cz: And how long have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, it's an exchange.
Some sources say it's long gone beyond 100 men.
Long ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we only liberated them... we didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors at war, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's how it is.
And every day comes another and another.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It is said that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust in the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe that's the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Commanding Council, I had acquired some authority earlier.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I act honestly and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is a Ukrainian government, or a baby or Luhansk very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are tortured and killed.
And that these are crimes.
I often risk my life, even in exchange for prisoners, and I've been captured... this job for me at any time may mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
... (long silence) ... Ukrainians and Separatists are being denied the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm afraid so.
And the executions?
They only happen on the baby side.
That the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian army is allowing anything like this to happen.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't even name the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irresistible opponents - for life and death.
As we say, they ate them all the way down the throat.
The same dreams and mournings were also evident in Majdan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating: Russia supports the separatists and the West the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
This sentence of mine already holds in itself an uncompromising contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the lines of a war front, I'm unarmed and showing soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I always get both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical targeting machine.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I can always see right... and they can pull the trigger on their weapons at any time.
Captain, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just like a small governorate in the great Russian empire.
In any case, they are constantly talking about it and consider Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
That state should not even exist in his opinion.
At the same time, he is an incomparable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the debate show of Ukrainian television, you have described your Prime Minister Arsenija Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times the fear.
Why, then, should I conceal myself with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians of Jaceňuk call themselves "the queen".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians who would be afraid of it or should have respect and authority for others.
His behavior is directly copying the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right to cry in the war in Parliament, to beg him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten to put up a position... he has to run the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
At the time of the country's threat, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest on paid emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just always complaining about everything.
He should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the markets
Newman 3 Sylvester Stallone has returned from the $90 million budget in the United States under $30 million and Sin City: A woman for whom I would kill from the 70 million budget only $12 million.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children like how to train dragon 2 were disappointing for cinema.
According to the film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, the quality of children's films is their fault.
Collin referred to 2014 as the “worst” year of children's films, and how to train Dragon 2 called it a simple “functional” continuation.
When it comes to films based on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average rating of summer film premieres broadcast at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of Victims of War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results taken into account by viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crop is similar to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, change in viewer access and greater popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix can be blamed.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's jungle book processing, reported on the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing. ”
We have to accept it and not try to chase after what's already been.
Unlike the current crisis of the Hollywood bank robbers, Netflix gained $1.2 billion, nearly twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studies for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the Hollywood “coupling. ”
In the light of the current collapse, some commentators say that there may be something at his catastrophic celebration.
With possible large bank robbers in 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimonů and Jurassic world, other figures are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in markets as simply “cyclical”. For Hollywood Reporter said: “The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash robbers in history and no one will worry about selling.
KLDR threatens Soul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea launched another short-range rocket into the sea, Saul announced.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
Changang Province lies in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman according to DPA stated that the shots were fired from a place in the northwest of KLDR and flew about 200 kilometres away.
North Korea thus apparently launched a missile from Changang Province for the first time, according to the South Korean media calling in military circles.
In the province there is a underground launch ramp for Scud rockets.
It is another of a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea did an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: Newport and Cardiff First Protests · Global Voices
During the weekend, protests were held by NATO opponents at the Newport summit.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough observed the situation during the weekend and spoke with protestors who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been flown from Blue Mountains.
Two young tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man took a tour of Govets Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they didn't come home, relatives called the police about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search squad was posted including the local police and rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 o'clock in the evening.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition, the ambulance was transferred to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc only brought a point from Opava, he had a win at the foot of Vasíček
The 23-year-old forvard could have decided, in two of the biggest chances, but failed.
After the goal, the gun rang close to three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on the goalie of Opava Josef Kveton.
I've had it on my feet, I've got to give it that chance.
I'm mad at myself," he put ashes on his head.
"I was supposed to put it under the lid, it kind of slipped my mind," he said.
The defension of Sigma did not permit Opava very much, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which was covered by the Reichl goalie.
Then they started pushing Hanáci, but they didn't let them in the block defending the natives, and the gunshots from a distance captured the Mayan.
Fifteen minutes we compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of a game, and Opava threatened us only with standard situations.
But he didn't change your chance, and it ended at 0:0," the coach Hanák Leoš Kalvod felt sorry.
Opava also took the point because of the absences in the composition, where in addition to the two wounded, Peter Vavřík was missing with three-point shooter Peter Ševčík, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike her former policy, she did not allow them to enter.
The replacements deserve discharge.
Sigma acted more football, but until one standard we didn't let her do anything," said Slezanov coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma made it to the four-point draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of Josef Lebra's club, who after defeat with Znojm conditioned his million-dollar deposit in a treasury with a diametrically different performance in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be talk about boys not wanting to fight," Calvoda noticed, and at the address of the sleeping shooter, Vashíčka added, "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall on him.
But after the first shot, I'm going to replace him immediately to save his goals for the next games," he laughed at Calvoda.
Al Pacino overtakes Venice twice.
Film festival otherwise experiences crisis
After a great enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárrito was among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days suggested that interest in the 71st annual festival in Venice had fallen somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has risen to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by criticisms recognized, but for viewers less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s.
Heroics of comic books
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not so far belie such crowds as in the past and allegedly ceased to be a problem of finding a last-minute place in the hotel.
There is more talk about the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that such institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world have been affected.
Fortunately, the crisis does not appear to be a lack of personalities, but it does exist exclusively in relation to films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully participated in 99 homes in the dramatic roles, the main event was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino for all generations.
He's got an extra one in two movies right now.
In the story of Transparency, recorded outside the competition by Oscar Barry Levison, according to the novel of Philip Roth, he has the 40-year-old Pacino’s role that is close to him: an actor at the top of fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him on the second day as a strange owner of a rural town hardware company in the Manglehorn film, recorded by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best performance should not be missed - but does Pacino's artist still have a price-format?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction is love for him by the audience, and especially the Italian audience, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the land from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded with a long applause of rebellion.
The Calabrian mafia base is viewed in it by the family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to match all the assumptions for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
He also participated in the chamber psychothriller Hunger Heart, who filmed Saverio Costanza with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child in her pathetic anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception, nor the Redemption for Glory, nor the 3 hearts, both works embossing on the traditional model of consumer films that rely on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, i.e. Birdman and the Black Soul, are not so small at the first half of the festival.
And even though the festival pictures have all sorts of depressing themes, a new picture of Peter Bogdanovich named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American gays in the '40s, was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drugs vehicles from Poland
"The detectives detained three men in the last days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a twenty-five-year-old woman who produced and sold drugs from last November to this August in Prague," police spokesman Jana Rössler said.
First on Tuesday, August 12th, a unit of intervention in Cihlářská Street caught a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who in the group appeared to be a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group on the basis of the previous approval of the state's attorney, a 17-year-old man.
The last of the four policemen fell in the middle of the morning on August 20th in the area of the small-scale incinerator," the speaker said.
A woman received a third of drugs for the transfer of drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the workshop in the summer area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konjevo street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced a pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transfer of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug produced, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale to drug addicts, he was assisted by a woman of 25 years, who had not yet been punished.
She received a reward from the organiser in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
On the basis of the order of the judge, criminals also carried out several home inspections, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and articles which, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"The police found out from the records available that since 1995 the main organizer has been convicted of property crime seven times since," the police spokesman added.
The latter was detained in 2006 conditionally convicted of a crime of sexual abuse and a seven-year-old car mechanic, who has been prosecuted for freedom, has been tried nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property criminal activity.
The interrogator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illegal production and other handling of delusional and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are at risk for up to ten years in prison.
In the end, the investigator submitted to the state representative a motion for a binding, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesman said.
The fourth accused, a 17-year-old repeater, was released.
His position and role in this case were not as essential as the other accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at very "interesting" prices.
In Italy, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board is used as a good example.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer gets a set of black wooden and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibres.
It's probably not surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If chess does not seem to you as a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also the Ferrari 500 F2 model produced (of course manually) at 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318 305.
Breaking down high school and high school doesn't make sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has few people in general, and statistics show that high school students have good application.
The start of the school year is here.
There have been great training in schools in the last 14 days.
Most are routine matters, such as transporting flowers from the summer storage facility back to the classroom and impaling chalks.
They're going to have a little bit more frmole in the burning gymnasium.
A few days before the beginning of the season, they seek furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature to the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not in public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by applying to the register of schools managed by MSMT.
“French Socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says the key ally of Francoise Holland
Valls calls on a strongly shaken left hand to "show her support" to the warlike Socialist President, whose new division of functions has not been met with the approval of the majority of French.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said and applauded.
As a peaceful gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite the passionate expectations of Emmanuel Macron, the new Finance Minister, who proposed at the beginning of the week to release the rules.
On Saturday Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "contained" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the minister of justice, however, made him a line of budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticised that she had caused "the French to lose faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leader of extremely conservative rights, has mocked the constant internal disputes between socialists when she said she does not assume that the new Valls government will last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls are also forced to form a new government when the former government did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Penová told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered in March's municipal elections, and in May extremely conservative rights succeeded in elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey of the public opinion of Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that French people will soon be patient if the new Socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art Prague no longer limit to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should prepare and approve the new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections another game and the city will not limit street art.
There's not even going to be a dog wedding.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the respective decrees in October elections.
"A decision on changes should not, moreover, be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends in a few weeks of mandate," Councilman Lukaš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several councils, such as Prague 5 and 7.
The game won't go away, the gambling decree won't change yet.
It's the task of new city leadership after the election.
We would not be able to do so technically now given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which had to be approved by the amendment, would take place on 11 September.
The referendum on the flat ban on gambling is scheduled on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
The ban on gambling is currently applicable in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, an application will not be changed even in the case of street art, so-called busing.
In particular, Prague 1 complains that she has already sent to the magistrate a proposal for places that she would like to extend to the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
The declaration regulating the dog-out of the city is being prepared for several months, not yet completed.
The location of the present and the issue of busing solves city decrees.
They can be issued or adjusted only by the capital's representation.
The councillors have only an advisory vote, they can't issue their own decrees.
Last week he placed a victory for the proponents of Scottish independence on the reach of the hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake the third time she almost placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether Scottie wanted to be rich.
But you won't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scottes tend to drive money changers out of the temple much more than to get them to dictate how to vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why in the television discussion he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between the Scottish civil society and the London financiers, and with the grimas he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the debate on the currency that Scotland will have has been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, employment opportunities and the defence of state health, which citizens have free.
Darling supported the London bankers in the matter of currency and also aroused the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
As Salmond put it, he got into bed with conservatives.
This is a very dangerous position for each Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of the British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee at home.
Scotti would respect it if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scottes are not supposed to jump out and have to accept what he is.

The end was the best of holidays, the last week that didn't go anywhere, and we were just hanging out with Grandma in the summer, quiet before the storm, quiet before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get out of Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading fast arrows, already falling, whistling on the bikes of the mountains around the Imperial to the rear behind Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, no longer heat, the sun cooled its back and shoulders, and the rays burst into farewell.
The evening of mild nervousness, still a vacation regime, sleep up until half past eleven, week after week will be worse, moments before bedtime will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, morning then rise at half past seven.
He'll be here Monday.
It doesn't rain most of the time, on the contrary, the summer gets viciously crouched in front of school.
To join in a ghost light on the plaque and feel like a plastic character in a glass mine, there's the school, ZDŠ A.
Popotky with a weird pink coat, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new, boys stretching out, girls bustier.
There's a bunch of creeps out there, and they avoid it, and it's just as interesting as it is to keep it together, and how soon they're here.
And these grown-ups looking girls who came screaming, now they're smiling hysterically, maybe something changed in their life over the holidays, while everything's back to normal.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and other pleasures, why are they even coming down here?
Because he has to, the education military compulsory.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately, is still the same thing that will lend the pupils the key to the tin box, where they are allowed to leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress stays in memory, now it doesn't fit, it's a nice twist, but next week it's gonna get worse.
It's just the idea that the stomach is tightening and the head is starting to ache.
The head, which is even worse for math, the devil's game for the chosen, among which I am not and never will be.
Again, the threes and the fours, don't let the fives, hide from the test, fall into the bench and best to post, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream so far of stories about nicer girls and nice buildings, about antennas in the universe, where no one can compete with anyone, humiliates anyone, and doesn't undermine anyone's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now it's like years ago.
She let her own daughters die.
She's in danger of extreme punishment - News.cz
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in a public toilet in a bus station in Jihlava.
With no foreign help, she was born with a baby girl who, after she had cut the umbilical cord, wrapped it in a ready blanket, hid it under a jacket, and took it to a road hauler, where she dropped it into the bushes located a few dozen metres from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus. I gave birth there.
She was born alive, watching me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school," the defendant described and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day, she returned to her place, put the baby's body in her backpack and drove it away, took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black needle bag and hid it and left it under the stairs of her grandmother's house in Havlíčko Brod," she complains that it is not entirely obvious when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been tens of minutes, but it could have been several hours after delivery, suffocating with a blanket or putting under a jacket, a hypothermia, or bleeding out of an unattended umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman near the unknown time from February to April 12 when the baby’s corpse was found by chance at a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, herself secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom at the loft in the family house.
Without checking to see if she was born alive without cutting and tying the umbilical cord around her neck, she put the baby in a couple of plastic bags, including an igelite bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it to her.
The father of both children was just a friend of the accused, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of his partner.
And for that reason, they are not now before the court, only he was punished for his error against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He was manipulating the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was wrong, but it came to me as a human at the time," did not hide the indignation of the accused, who allegedly succumbed to and feared in a man's relationship.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke in a relatively balanced manner.
Tears moved her to the point where she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching her age.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't have equipment because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," the judge answered.
However, she refused to act on the purpose and purpose of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
Even when she was pregnant, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I even limited smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed to all and the repeated questions that she was having health problems that she was being seduced.
And that, my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A judgment could already be delivered on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a penalty rate of up to 18 years in prison, or with an exceptional penalty.

The agreement could already be published this week, the source announced on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.

Sources did not wish to be appointed because negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond at the request for a comment, spokesman Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced $1.2 billion in sales, 6% more than in the previous year.
In the coming year, it is expected that the ninety-billion-billion-dollar travel segment will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
Companies compete to make these customers the preferred option for selecting excursions.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public tender in January 2014.
Apollo has the majority in the company since 2007 since the closing of the 850 million dollar trade.

The Chinese authorities provoke the prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong the day after the vote.
Nearby was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two out of three candidates to participate in the Hong Kong elections in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointing commission, which will likely be made up of members of the faithful Beijing.
As a result of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and protect Hong Kong's financial centre to protest the "Occupation of the Centre".
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for the tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will expand to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists organised an informal referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference to be held by Prime Minister Li is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee, Zhang Ronghsun, and Deputy Director of the National Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei, were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have announced that they will gather in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on “national sovereignty”
According to a description of the events, Russian newspaper asked Russian President Vladimír Putin on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately open negotiations on "state sovereignty" of the excluded areas.
His spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated in order for the Russian-speaking region to have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kyiv government to deal with the pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with a clear strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant Novorusa's newly declared de facto independence so that the place with the West can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of State TV Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions, which are to regain eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April ruled by the separatists after Moscow surveyed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatist recently occupied territory were described as “Novorusia” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the glorious pre - revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words, according to which everyone who believes there are peace talks on the horizon is a prisoner of illusion, because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign before the 26th October parliamentary elections, while government units are attacking civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty in the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been dealt with by Kiev for several months and which is intended to ease Russian concerns about the threats of cultural and linguistic rights.
Sandov stated that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern region.
It is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The step taken by the spokesman of the Kremlin, which was to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin's notes, highlighted Russia's leadership's approach to resolving the uprising of separatists in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million population originally ranks among ethnic Russians.
Most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys of public opinion that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for the survival in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and in essence give the Kremlin factual control over the territory that would link Russia's land to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was surveyed five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime trading grounds and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea are also the centre of the downs, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural speech of 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and Separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals following the insurgents' next procedure last week after Russian troops and tanks from the former calm area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separatists strengthened the Russians took control of Novoazovsk in such a way that Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a draw in order to occupy strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has accelerated the enormous civil and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovska and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Porošenko attended a meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilova after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovia during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian crewmen captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the exposed photos scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown was in shock after Jennifer Lawrence’s internet series of explicit naked photos was caught in the biggest scandal with hacked photos of the celebrity.
Hacker claims that he has 60 photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Deleving, Rihanna singers, Ariane Grande and Ley Michell and Kirsten Dunst actresses.
Due to the escape from iCloud, personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko reportedly got to the public.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecco last month, said to the magazine Confitellite: “It’s disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and extended to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reports online news reports that the hacking is “unscrupulous” and those who have become its target “are perceived to be humiliated”.
He thinks the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him crashing up at the pool.
For example, Palmer acted in Love and Honor, where she was a rival Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning yesterday, the stolen pictures didn't comment.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: “It’s a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen of the hacker on his twitter criticized: “Publicing photos of hacked phones is just like selling stolen goods. ”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma football players have settled down, even without winning.
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigmy Josef Lebr sent to his subordinate last week, are apparently past.
Although from Opava they finally brought only the point behind the unsuspecting draw.
After all, the club boss’s planting and fighting were only a little more comfortable.
Payout money could come to the club soon.
"I have another match, as I spoke about last week, but I am already far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed, despite Sigma's failure to win, his players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and the deployment with which we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from players.
In that case, I can forgive myself for not winning.
If we have been playing this way since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," he thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial domestic pressure, then the game settled and in the second half was already better.
After the victory, Calvoda’s confederates reached out, but they couldn’t reach the goal, and they couldn’t win.
Although the result is not according to our ideas.
To our full satisfaction we lacked only one changed chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the access of football players was only a threat.
There must have been more than one aspect.
Be it from my side, from the coach or from the fans," said Lebr.
Sigma must calculate the pressure
After the Opava event last week, players were reluctant to comment.
I'm trying to get this stuff out of my system.
I tried not to admit it," shook young goalkeeper Michal Reichl with his head.
Without comment, then left a question to Lebrow from last week's attacker Václav Václav Vášíčeček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in Saturday's game.
But then he was just talking a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to come up on us.
Today we have shown that if we fight and ride everyone's ass, it will work," he said.
Warnings have taken to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda made sure that preparations for the game were not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was clear that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about them not wanting to fight and pushing it away before," the Olomouc coach thought.
It was like the first 15 minutes of today.
It took us a long time to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league is about.
That it is not only about football, but mainly about the fighting," Kalvoda said.
It's not until we hope that Sigma will work from the beginning in the next fights.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
