In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, around 1-00, a man in 1947, in Lugovje village, committed suicide through hanging.
He's known to have attempted suicide before.
Which led a man to such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, between 11 and 50, a 41-year-old man, a Chinese man, was killed in his residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, according to the MOI press service "Kinezemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the decaying highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly mounted on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track and transmit each roadway mile to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the obsolete American highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state planning bodies.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning suddenly generated intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Liberians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government with the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and perhaps even where you travel, and then to use that information in the compilation of tax accounts.
It's a chaepitation movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
Although Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not waiting.
They are thinking about how they can move on to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists are already testing these black boxes, some of which are satellite tracking.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue on which we may have a choice,” said Hasan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Government, who is preparing plans to begin tracking by the authorities of the state of the miles carried by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay those taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Development Fund, which is financed by taxes that Americans pay on auto-fuels.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Car travels more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise even one cent tax at high gas prices.
“The gas tax cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on vehicles to test the pay system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
Boring calls it a wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since tax may change the nature of road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California planning bodies are monitoring the system in developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the state ' s ambitious global warming laws.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber ' s Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system to be the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to have drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that goes into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Political Vice President Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move in the direction of mistaken pay.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel miles in daily life to get to work or to town.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of service instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
He's in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which comprises 17 East Coast transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track them every step of the way.
“The concern about the “big brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the US Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a vast, vast technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the day-to-day movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states with difficult searches for low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of motor vehicles miles without information on location and time.
If you can do that, said Han, society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not cooperate in the collection of State taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of car insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of running.
But the devices she's testing are attracting road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded with a modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you do not track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been some major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can select a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by choosing instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all state residents drive.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public by making devices do more and not less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a tax device that will also pay parking meter fees, provide “payments as you drive” insurance and collect real-time speed data from other drivers who could use them to avoid traffic jams.
“Car drivers will attract the benefits they will be offered,” the city design document states.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether all false pay talks are simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Gulf Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could simply overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for the construction of highways by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
“No need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private lives and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas as well as to reach agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to a possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations on the stand-by loan are under way with IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can obtain 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF can overcome long-standing differences in funding conditions.
He did not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain assistance and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday, lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one stage to "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, most of which now comes from Russia.
Maybe it's gas from North Stream or reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can be used for only a few weeks, and is likely to lead to lower deliveries to other regions.
"There are negotiations between the EU and Ukrainian countries on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Reiter.
Russia, outside the control of urban pollution by automobiles
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have occurred in most of the world’s megapolises since the second half of the twentieth century.
Generally speaking, it was either the redesign and expansion of highways or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time of their use.
Singapore is well known for its strong quota of private car growth and its right to purchase is purchased at auctions.
Its price may be two or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have paid access to the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, allowing only vehicles with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Unit of the Municipal Environmental Bureau, Beijing Li Kunseng, said, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private vehicles to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million) and to increase not more than 5 per cent of the fuel used per vehicle.
According to the agency, transportation in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the limitation of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of “green five-year-old” include the accelerated transition to Euro-fuels, the introduction of local eco-standards and vehicle and fuel labelling, the restriction on the entry of vehicles to the central city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include the ban on all private vehicles to travel within the fifth transport ring (all in the PRC's capital six), one day per week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle's registration plate), and the issuance of lottery-based vehicle registrations (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery operation, the total number of licenses for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the 2012-2020 Environment Protection Programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere were from mobile sources in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from vehicles are ten times more than industrial ones and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
In the RF, it is only time to think about the possibilities of restrictive vehicle regulation in the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are clearly unpopular, can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car, where there are two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects, namely official and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of “privileged” users, with a total number of at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total Moscow fleet).
During the day, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study to examine the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and the amount of road transport.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre is twice as expensive as it is required, and most of the drivers in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking spaces or just in the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed not to build a parking space, but to expand, but to reduce the roadway (in order to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and accommodation of passenger transport within the territory of the historical centre security zone (a total area of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The damage to unauthorized street trade in Vault would rise in proportion to
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to regulate the Vault and clear the streets of natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they carry out are often not subject to adequate sanitation.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit for citizens ' fine for unauthorized trade will increase six times from 500 roubles to 3,000 rubles from November, according to the press service of the Wulfada Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for Russia's chief driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer credits and the mass reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is due entirely to consumption, which is almost inefficient," said chief economist Goldman Sachs of Russia Clemens Graffé, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the Russian economy investor.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
When inflation is 6%, it can supply future consumer demand at about the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to opt for staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of GDP: if wages rise by 10%, GDP is only 2%,” explained Mr. Graffé.
Companies have experienced a decrease in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, says chief economist Barclays Capital of Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for employees is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to deceive or retain current employees.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In Mr. Grafé's view, due to the very high consumer interest rates, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“We have not seen the benefits of the economy from the increase in the demand for credit, the money does not diverge in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” said the economist.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in outstanding loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a consequence, they are not returned more often," Mr. Graffé noted.
Therefore, the second threat of economic growth in Russia is the possible default crisis on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute VSE Vasily Solodkov is already seeing signs of a growing banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the banks, were forced to attract high interest funds to the population.
In response, the bank went to war and started lowering its credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative margin.
If they do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full banking crisis, Vasily Solódkov believes.
The dislicension of a number of banks in recent weeks by economists has been seen as a harbinger of mass destruction.
“The banks themselves will fail: the investment insurance system was originally not designed for a systemic crisis”, the head of the institution cautions.
But consumption growth will slow and without a non-payment crisis, the investment is believed to be due to the failure to index the salaries of the employees and the military as set out in the current budget version.
The partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs for natural monopolies (and, as a result, by the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and there is not yet a reference), the increase in consumption will still slow, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is that oil prices continue to fall,” he said.
It is estimated that Russia's economy will begin to decline at a price of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that CB has not yet been able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that declared the transition to inflation targeting," said Clemens Graffre.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates; it only affects inter-bank lending rates.
"For CB, this is the collapse of all hopes," said Clemens Graffre.
The money received from CB auctions is not used by banks to finance the economy, but rather to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is reduced, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“It will be sooner or later that the CB understands that this strategy is not working,” said Mr. Graffé, and recalled that the State plans to put the ruble into “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it would have to be done sooner, or the key rate for CB (5.5%) would have to be raised, he said.
According to his estimate, the course of the ruble is now artificially over ten percent.
The ruble is only one way to lose weight, the expert concludes.
But if the CB dives into the financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the destruction of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of cutting the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more strongly.
In Chelyabinsk, the 2nd Congress of the Peoples of South Ural was held.
The Forum is linked to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian Statehood and the 20th anniversary of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and regions participated, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities, a total of around 350.
The Forum is aimed at strengthening inter-national agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences and no differences.
We live in full understanding," said Feophane, Metropolitan Chelabinski and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the departure, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelibin Region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “co-operate” with Germany on the question of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence agent, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German Deputy Hans Christian Streebelle met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Though the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat it as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, reported Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to make this possible”.
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads the parliamentary group responsible for intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him at risk and without destroying relations with the United States entirely”, it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, MP from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to a former contractor's lawyer, the NSA, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in security”, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the world response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — have found exposure to an uncontrollable system of all - pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge you for a handhold.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying a handcuff aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 per hand and $2 per coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers could keep the entire bank.
The new bill for handbags extends to the bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said she'd charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they were on the landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of payment in advance.
“We do not want to charge for this,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second baggage bag in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges charge as much as they can, in the hand pad placed in the upper baggage compartments, which is why these compartments often lack space.
The collection is one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new fundraiser wasn't really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier's most loyal clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website should not pay.
This means that one passenger in turn at the departure of the Frontier flight can transfer the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change of procedures on the website and the Frontier registration costs were intended to guarantee that passengers would be aware of the collection before they got on board.
The new Frontier collection for the handhold will not start until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover air traffic costs after several years of loss.
Most of them, however, were not concerned with the fee for handrails.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first installment three years ago, and another Allegiant Air disc jockey followed her example later.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said Air Consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, Spirit’s handrail collection is $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the landing site when passengers encountered an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I saw as a career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth grinding and the fight coming at the landing.
The plane was taken, he said, “and the landing was fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 bill for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice can keep the entire bank and that the share of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water free of charge.
The US Airways had been trying for a short time to charge for drinks in 2008, but had abandoned it seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline had followed suit.
Frontier's manual billing initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last resort to attracting customers to their website.
Air companies pay online ticket sellers, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than resorting to a travel online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles to the frequent passenger who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium mileage to 25 per cent of the mile travel.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would buy 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only be selected in advance if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and losing.
The benefit decreased by 9 per cent and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to a financial result published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline sales.
The NSA is guilty of "internal error", not of hackers ending the site.
A secret national security agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their site had caused a technical malfunction for several hours rather than hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planned renewal”, the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Declarations that the interruption was due to a distributed “service failure” type attack [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, on-line server monitoring systems had registered that the NSA site had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Previously, the NSA representative reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency was “not” broken into.
No classified information was in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of activist hackers claimed that it was responsible for withdrawing from the NSA site through DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to capture the target site by traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of line.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly supersecret NSA, formerly called "No Such Agency", has been at the centre of public attention and intense criticism in recent months, following a series of revelations of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of this reaction to the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former NSA officer, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted action by hackers.
The income of Bombardier decreases with the drop in deliveries and the number of orders per aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net profit due to reduced number of orders and transfers of aircraft in the third quarter and contracts in its railway unit.
The Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide any new information as to whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft into commercial operation will be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft sample, which took place about one and a half months ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions as to whether the time frame tests are in progress.
The results did not support projections and led to a decline of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, dropped his assessment on Thursday from “over-market” to “medium-market” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited to the next quarter or two.
“Although the reduction in the number of aircrews was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the revenues of the transport unit,” said Doerken in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders to CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptic of the programme.
The Bombardier company hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first pilot aircraft was submitted in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not much at present — 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of summer tests to verify the company’s claims of fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Pierre Bodouan, Chief Executive Officer, was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward according to plan.
“The aircraft’s test model was not longer on the ground than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software were planned during the plane’s simple operation.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for the update, so we did.
This will take place throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, as the company reported.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to begin operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the date of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests - although it seems to be consistent with the internal Bombardier schedule - reinforces our view that the entry into operation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerken.
In the third quarter, which ended on 30 September, Bombardier's net income decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the share remained at 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported placing 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aviation division portfolio was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the aviation field, results were in line with our objectives, but a small number of incoming orders and common market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Boduan.
Gross aviation revenue fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector had grown by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, which was slightly higher than the 31 December figure.
The revenues of the transport unit have been negatively affected by several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be submitted in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Google Patrick Pichett's chief financial director would be on the board of directors, dropped by 8.5 per cent, to C$4,83 at the mid-Thursday bidding.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual profit.
Japan's electronics producer, Sony Corporation, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profit for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more embarrassing than was expected to be due to the drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter of the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, again fell to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially due to reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, the Panasonic Corporation, has recently placed emphasis on industrial kits: the company's sales are growing at a high pace, especially through automobile systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operational returns against expected earlier 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts suggested that the figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food ambulance.
In the middle of this month, the sale of "smart" hours from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashion functions was announced, which will eliminate the need for 100 times a day to extract smartphones from its pocket.
After Sony's annual income and profit forecast dropped, the company's stock in Tokyo in the morning lost more than 11 per cent at a price, down to 1668 yen per share.
The gene of speech has been a synapses education stimulant
Scientists at the University of John Hopkins and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that has enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and its brief contents can be read on the magazine’s website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
In 2001, it was possible to identify families from a number of people who could not speak properly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have violated the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions are being promoted by Foxp2 as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the area of speech-related brain formation.
This is done by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 is the only active source of it.
The fact that SRPX2 actually affects the vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When animals had artificially reduced gene activity, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sound emitted was restored.
Previously on mice, the connection to Foxp2 itself was also shown.
Animals with a human copy of the gene ate more actively at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and the SRPX2 management, respectively, are related to purely "mechanical" sound education properties or to finer processes.
A cocaine addict who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditt gave information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
Counsel feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction had been imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditt provided the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough with secret information about investigating his activities on illicit drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash and named as a "cool lawyer" among the criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to monitor Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three packets of cocaine at a lawyer's house in the town of Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at a lawyer's association dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta had “used” Class A drugs regularly, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain unlawful information on the arrests of two persons on the order of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during this time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercida, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police withdrew heroin and cocaine in a series of raids worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditt reported to the criminals because he was afraid that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, who works at the Forbes Solicitors legal firm in Blackburn, he was disgraced after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice as a result of a three-week trial at the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He admitted to holding cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer's disclosure came after the Scarborough police investigation found out that he regularly spoke to Ditt on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him coming to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent pure drugs in a black golfer under a lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after the Scarborough broadcast, he repeatedly called from Ditt, who was at the Ivod Park football stadium at the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Ditt had “used cocaine regularly” after tests found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditt was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client and insisted that their association was a “law secret”.
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to draw some credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
When interrogating the police, he said that he had also had a home office, and clients came to him in legal cases.
However, it became clear to the court that after the major arrests, he called the major actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented before the court to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In Ann White's indictment, she said, "If anyone knows they should not violate the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed himself to be doubted by his lack of interest.
Ditt did not plead guilty and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal criminal lawyer as soon as he has begun to acquire drugs from organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of the criminal groups, who had instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire confidence and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta gave up his trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation was carried out by Lankasher ' s unit on particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to three cocaine cases and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the scope of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced 14 years after admitting his guilt in conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons involved in fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized an interview in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The Jaroslavle Stadium is not ready for reception of 22,000 spectators, according to police officers who were present today at the CDC RFC meeting.
The ticket programme was overstated, in their view, by about twice.
During the match 1/16, only a thousand stewards were involved in the Russian Cup finals with Spartacus at the regulatory rate of nine thousand.
Spartacus’s infirmists had 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
These figures were read by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigorianz.
Americans overheard Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the United States Special Forces, which chose not to disclose their name, said that the State was listening to telephone calls by Japanese high-ranking officials.
The man confirmed that there were several listening points in the country of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand were not conducting intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, is a post-war intelligence target despite allied relations with Americans, reported the NHK TV channel.
None of the parties have officially commented on this information.
Remember, news about US Special Forces monitoring the chancellor of the FRG showed up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some reports, has been very ill to report her audition.
She stated that the allies, who she considered to be the FWG and the United States for decades, had been unacceptably monitored by the head of Government.
However, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share the details of Angela Merkel's phone calls with the German prosecutors.
A German has come to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Baskirija Can place grain on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014
Baskiria can place grain on the market during public procurement interventions not earlier than 2014, according to the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
“Possible grain will be auctioned after the New Year”, he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that during the current year crop cultivations under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million ha of grain crops, a 3.3 per cent increase over last year.
In 2014, 550 thousand ha were planted (over 105,000 ha in 2012).
The area under the winter wheat and triticals has been enlarged, and the rose has remained at the previous level.
There is no "Brother Circle" group assigned to Lepsa in the U.S.
In the database of the Russian forces of the "Brother Circle" group, to which Washington was assigned by the singer Gregory Leps, it does not mean anything.
As Interfax noted in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after media reports of US Finance Ministry Grigory Lepsa's inclusion in the watch list of the suspicion of belonging to the Eurosian criminal syndicate Bratsky klub have been verified, but no such groups have been found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad, is believed to be in power structures.
"Even in the very name 'Brother Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint on the secret bed.
"It's all very much like a pier-action," said the agency's interviewee.
On 31 October, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced the inclusion of Artur Badalyan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lalin, Sergei Moscalenko, Jacob Rybalski and Igor Schlykov in its audit lists of suspicions of belonging to the Eurosian criminal union.
Persons on the list have been suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the United States authorities, Gregory Leps is "a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
At Grigory Leps' production center, they refused to comment on the US's allegations against the singer, calling them "cradle."
In 2011, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, referred to the “Brother Circle” as “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and entrusted the Minfin with “supporting and preventing their global criminal operations”.
Putting a person on American Minfin's blacklists entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
Scandal video caught up with the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless visits, got caught up in smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had the video and were ready to launch an investigation against the Mayor.
Tot stated that he would not leave, CNN reported.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use came from a Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but that he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford’s compromising video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, but there had been no evidence of it until recently.
The mayor himself has no comment on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault and he's not going to quit.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in Ford Alexander Lisa's 35-year-old friend, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisa served as Rob Ford's driver.
The city's residents have long been demanding their mayor's resignation.
He fought with journalists on several occasions, appeared in a drunken public, allowing himself racist and sexist statements.
Assmann Beraten + Planen, the winner of the tender for the selection of the projector.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the CCA press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to state-of-the-art in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport facilities.
During the first phase of construction, the inner area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, which may then be increased.
According to Rostovaroinvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender came to light, the architectural concept of the Southern Aerospace Complex was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal embodys the idea of an air bridge between Rostov na Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed C and E terminals at Sheremetjevo International Airport and a new airport complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Axei district of Rostov oblast and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and integrated into the city building in the future.
The construction of an aerospace complex is scheduled to start in 2014, and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A politician in Turkey declares a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the area of Nusaybin, south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party of the PMC strongly opposed construction.
The mayor of the Turkish border with Syria, Nusaybin Ayse Hekhan, declared a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to RIA Novosti in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PIC) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly staged protests.
The head of Turkey's Ministry of the Interior, Muammer Guler, first challenged the construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybina Ayse Hekhan, a member of the PMD, declared hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party said in the press service.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossing the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation that Kurds will never agree with”, Aisha Gekhan of the party quoted.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set exchange rates for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, Bolivar, vis-à-vis the tourist dollar.
On 1 November, the Bloomberg Agency referred to a government decree.
Foreign travellers are allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolar vis-à-vis the dollar will be determined later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolars per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolars.
Since the beginning of the year, Bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The oil minister and vice-president for the economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October, that Venezuela had no plans to delve the Bolivar.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas can still decide to reduce the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing consumer prices and consumer goods, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a lack of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, director of the South, said it was hard to tell how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev resigned.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, it brings up the ITAR-TASS to Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the options.
A priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
It's not just about finding a coach, it's about someone who's been working in our club for a few years and getting some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary “will always be biased because it is a continuation of the Government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya's global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially enable the Government to “take the media with a dead grip”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been seriously hit” and criticised the bill as “drakonovské”.
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media has provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly looting the expensive shopping centre.
The police chief David Kimayo responded to the call of two journalists and a media officer for questioning, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new publishing law, up to 20 million Kenyan shillings can be fined, and individual journalists up to one million at an additional risk of being “removed from the lists”, i.e. a ban on official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is sufficient to paralyse the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “lived blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media quiet, they will be able to do everything they can, without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balancing forces in public life.
“The policies presented to themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been a target of public anger in the past.
In May they voted in favour of lifting the reductions imposed by the National Wages Commission and restoring their huge salary of about 532 000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new cost line in the utility payments of the enemy, a contribution to the major repair of the house.
At the most approximate rate, the standard two-bedroom apartment will have to be paid from 100 to 400 roubles a month from the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the exact norm.
However, when you decorate the driveway, get the ladder cells in order, or even replace the elevator, the lodgers themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by the MPs of the District Duma.
Vladimir Klunikov, Chairman of the Voronez Regional Duma, noted: “In this case, it is also necessary to order the order of the construction of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management of companies, which we often register in Moscow, in Orenburg, somewhere else, it will be to establish State control over the expenditure of the inhabitants for repairing multi-family houses.”
Under the control of the State, there is now a stock building.
The law that protects against fraud has been approved by the oblivion of final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,000 people were injured by dishonest builders.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the building.
Vladimir Klunikov, Chairman of the Voronez Regional Duma, stated: "It is not a secret that abuse also started in this area, because in the year 98 the same lengths fell, and in the 2000s the same lengths."
People started making money to cover up a loophole, including the adoption of the two laws.
Under Voronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The District Parliament has adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
At least take away the problem of illegal migrants in the region.
Thus, in the past year, a little over 100,000 foreigners had been admitted to migration accounts.
But only one in five made the official work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klunikov, chairman of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: “They have violated the law, but they are not criminals.”
There's no court, and we have to deport them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that, by regional means, such sites should be equipped.
In Voronez region, this is the Old Olshanka of Semiluk district.
Finally, the regional parliament granted new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case is 3.5 million, but so are many parents.
Secondly, and that is the main thing, for those who adopt 3rd and lower, they will be issuing housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 metres.
A family, for example, of six people, is Dad, Mother, Mother, Child, and 3 are adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the State acquires 108 square metres of housing for 3 million 300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or for the South-West Microregion, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the center for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalya
The current OAS Board of Directors, Uralkaliya, has proposed the nomination of an arrested representative of Minsk, Vladislav Baumgertner, to serve as a new council member, to be reported on the Russian company's website.
Bamugertner listed 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will establish a new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
At present, Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk.
In his detention in August this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges against Baumgertner were classified as “sacrifice”.
Petty Officer Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's resignation from the lower man's post.
The Golicoper believes that the acting chief coach, Dmitri Balmin, enjoys great authority and responsibilities.
Remember, today the Neftechymic resigned Crikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's dismissal, says Dalton RIA "News".
All I can tell you is that Dmitri Balmin will handle the obligations he's assigned to him, which I have no doubt about.
He has great authority on the team, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to a great future.
Younventusa Protector Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the close match of the Italian champion with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the training staff decided not to include him in the game application to take a break from the 4th round of the League of Champions' Group Round with Real.
Nor will they take part in a unit with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vucinić and Pepe.

U.S. Secretary of State: Sometimes “departed too far” in data collection
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that, in gathering data and wiretaps, US intelligence “had gone too far”, but the politician noted that the media’s coverage of 70 million people was not valid.
I assure you that innocent people did not get hurt during this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was wrong.
I admit that, as the President admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," the Secretary of the AFP quoted it.
Italian interns make way for young people
Italian unemployment is record-breaking.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population is now unemployed.
This was not the case since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This experiment has already been carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for the internees.
On the other hand, Italy is waiting for a common problem for Europe for the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that premature rotation will justify themselves.
The construction of the TPU in Moscow will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport-transmission hubs (TSAs).
By 2020, 255 TPs are planned to be introduced.
What really turns the project into was our correspondent's handling.
A few months ago, a construction plant was created at the Smolenska Metro of Arbatsko-Pokrovska.
The inscription stated that a transport-transplant hub was being installed.
All of this was very strange, as no land transport stops near Smolensky and therefore cannot be moved on.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, about 130 metres must be cleared, including a ground crossing through the Carmanic Passage.
Smolenssky's almost done.
The florist’s larvae disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a bra.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, as explained in the press service of the capital department of transport.
There's no capital traffic yet.
The planes include the construction of parking spaces, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with passenger traffic, the creation of small architectural forms and facilities.
In fact, even the transporters do not operate flat-line ITPs, but professional promoters from the Moscow City Capital Repair Department.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains the Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Mikhail Blinkin High School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs over the head and board to report the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Jasenevo Metro has recently been opened with a fully fledged flat-line transmutation node.
Let it be free of the curtains, but with the interceptors and the signboard, which indicates when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of a number of officials, they're recording everything that's hit.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build a 151 knot, 59 of which had capital construction.
There are now 255 TPs in the plans up to 2020.
Of these, one and a half are promised this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of MTUs, there are no qualitative criteria, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the Public Organization City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant is often deteriorating.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first, reduction of transplant time, second, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, the opposite is sometimes the case when the TPU is installed.
It's a bright example of the subway.
Formerly suburban buses from Jaroslav highway came to square before the main entrance to the VCC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on the street of the cosmonauts.
Farther the subway, much further from the monorels, but closer to the residential homes.
In spite of the fact that the residents did not want to have a car accident under the windows and complained about all possible instances.
There was no immediate problem with the major RDPs in Moscow.
The first one started building five years ago on the Planner Metro.
The project was intended to be a model.
Indeed, there was a pattern of how the transfer node to the investors was transformed into a banal trading centre.
No, there's a bus platform, a shed to keep the subway from going under the rain, and three floors of the bus stop.
True, Chemical Trolleybus Nos.202 and No.203 in Moscow's TPU did not give place in principle.
They've been pushed off the subway like strangers.
But there's more trading space.
There's only one 32 store clothes, and there's almost everything from zoos to car salons.
Well, in fact, what bus passenger would need to buy a new car on the way?
We have, when they're building a capital MVP, there's always a mall.
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the car park decided to put it into the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planerna" TRP, there is a fighting trade in semi-marked parking spaces.
The vegetables, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-Russian speech, and the guards looking at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planner Metro used to have a market, but it was demolished.
At the prefecture, merchants were saddened and allowed to enter the intercepting parking space of the transshipment hub.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market's been demolished to build a new flat-rolled truck in its place.
It's like this rocking.
The metro "Kluzhsky" has a 50-metre metro-bus approach, according to Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping centre, the TPN reportedly increased to 170 metres.
To get on a bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it must be gleaned under the open sky.
After all, the designs on Planner and Kolujska will soon be displayed with flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground ditches.
The main monster will grow up on the Tushino Metro, with 418.7 thousand square metres of square space.
Representatives of the Railway Railway Stations Directorates responsible for the construction of the subway station have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be located in future workshops.
Officials assure us that many of the parking spaces are between three and half square meters.
Take, for example, the "national" garages.
The garage, for example, has an area of 8,015 square metres (8015 sq. m) for 258 places recently built on International Street.
So it's going to take about 80,000 "squares" for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars at the "Petrovsko-Razumovsky".
That's less than a third of the shit they're going to build there.
Let's have one or two floors on every bus platform.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
And that's almost two GMAs for a minute.
If railways build major stations and railway stations, the remaining sites will be conquered by the metropolises.
They also promised that there would be many functional objects, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in Moscow City Property Department, journalists were recently told that they were developing a draft regulation that would allow investors to apply for a station for TPU directly to officials.
No contests.
Because, mate, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The perfect station is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or the Spatial Station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
Trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres away.
There's no more trade around here.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we blow 25 floors off with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
In order to provide legal protection for the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults of Russia, Justice Russia proposes to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
According to the News newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by Oleg Mihei Mihei, a premeditated thinker ' s energy committee, are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the human being ' s emotional relationship with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by his love for the country, his responsible attitude towards its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheiev, there are sanctions in national law for abuse of the formal characteristics of State authority, flag and coat of arms.
According to parliamentarians, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected by both the insult of State symbols and other contempt for our country, was insufficient in Russian law.
As an example, he introduces annual debates on the canon of Victory Day, where some media characters are allowing themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, Victory Day, 9 May, the present vakahanalia is being opened annually.
By practicing in wit and the “alternative view” of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I find this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation, is outraged by Oleg Miheiev.
In addition, according to Miheiev, patriotic people in Russia are far greater than religious people, but the law punishes insult to the feelings of the believers, and it can be almost unpunished to offend patriotic feelings.
In the opinion of the People ' s Chosen One, it is necessary to compare the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill penalizes the abuse of patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousand fine to a 5-year sentence.
The 6.6 Magnitude earthquake took place on Thursday, 31 October, near Kokimbo, in central Chile, by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, specified on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The beats were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November Moscow).
Victims or those caused by the underground rushes of destruction are not yet reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events was in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and the tsunami caused by it killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960 it recorded a 9.5 Magnitude.
More than 5,000 people were killed as a result of the disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly.
Prime Minister of the RF Dmitri Medvedev reported on Friday that the Greenpeace Act will be dealt with strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee law enforcement”, said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
One of the Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanu, like other activists, is charged with bullying.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen,” quotes Mr. Ero's “RIA Novosti”.
“Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to break the laws,” said Dmitri Medvedev.
He said that the activities of any entity that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “like powder barrels” and recalled what had been happening in the Gulf of Mexico, he referred to “RIA Novosti”.
UN declares new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the MDG target, which expires in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, launched in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the outcome document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit participants the night before that it was time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am glad that UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of establishing the universal goals of sustainable development — the CSD,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 vision.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by Member States to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
In view of them at the top of the statues of Samora Machel, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands gathered in downtown Maputo to chant slogans for peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sus, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business costume to a T-shirt decorated with “We Need Security” in Portuguese, and she joined a crowd on Thursday in the Independence Capital Square.
Within two weeks, virtually daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been received — one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known as a rebel movement, supported first by the White Authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 Truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to be facing a full-scale conflict again, but recent developments have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The rates are high for the fast growing economy, as the opening of huge shelf stocks of gas and coal deposits in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Uni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo ruling party, which has been leading the political force since 1975, and the Renamo party, have accused each other of the tension created.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government became the founder of the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo fence, on 17 October.
The attacks against former rebels then escalated when Government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, according to Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes by accusing the party of attacking a soldier.
President Armandu Gebusa tried to resolve concerns about instability.
Hebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt as if he had been a “failureer” who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears have increased following the announcement that Mazanga had declared that Renamo had rejected the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he had in mind the non-compliance of Frelimo's agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness”, Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful people (Gabouza and Dhlama) who were struck by the foreheads”, said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reform, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who had to leave office the following year when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofia, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was reluctant to ask him if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo's party wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going well," Mazanga said.
Dissatisfaction has increased by the Government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to be restored, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The Art Mainstream series of premiere films will be held in Moscow
The Art Mainstream Film Series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they leave, will be held at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with a reference to project organizers.
It will open the Art Mainstream program of the French comedy director and actresses, Reim Kerichi, Paris at any cost.
This is the story of the Maya (Kerichi) model working in the French capital, which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Douk "Mebius", the melodramatic bayopic artist Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and main film held in May at the Cannes Film Festival "Live Adele" Abdelatif Cash.
The only Russian member of Art Mainstream will be the winner of the film Alexander Veledinsky's Film Festival, based on Alexey Ivanov's one-name novel.
The main role of the successful teacher Victor Sporekin was in the film by Constantine Habensky, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaura Prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The Torah's words could show that “the rude power cannot defeat the refined cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths would be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley Holland advocates “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into a twenty-year education programme.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “takes interest” in children, and the main ideas “sublimated” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, also wrote the “Counsel of Norwegian Myths” for Penguin and the “British People’s Tales”, said, “You may have intentions, but you are better off keeping them with you.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that there is an innate understanding of good and evil.
This must be sublimated; it is revealed through history and not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show it, not tell it.
In Voronez region, a football fan is detained, breaking the window in the train station waiting room.
At nine o'clock on the evening of 29 October, two Moscow-based football fans were removed from the passenger train at Grossi Voronez police station.
On their way to the game of their favorite team, the guys had a drunk debut on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station at the Grosse Police Station to prepare a protocol on administrative offence.
There the fans repented in their antisocial conduct.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and the station station was waiting for him to arrive.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the train station.
A transport police officer and COP "RJD" security guard broke into the broken glass.
They were able to apprehend an intruder who tried to hide from the scene.
South-Eastern LU personnel of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are being screened.
A criminal case is being initiated, and a senior referee of South-East Ministry of Public Relations reported on Russia's transport by Sergei Olhovik.
Vital Mutko: Waterworks?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sport Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the rostrums during the match "Spartak" of the Russian Cup.
I am in favour of the organizers of sporting events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they've taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone to come and order.
That's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We've got to get the sick people organized, the clubs have to invite their stewards, not put them on their own.
We have now developed a special Government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once adopted, we will deal with this issue very closely.
But I'm still going to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
It feels like they're the Bavarians in Jaroslavle, and they've got it all figured out.
We're foreign observers.
And it's awful to see the rostrum coming out of the brandspot.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we came back 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
US Special Forces Officer Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in cases of wiretaps by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation could be answered by an American to the questions raised by representatives of the German Procurator-General in writing or in the eye in Russia.
Edward Snauden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In that case he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the U.S. Allied States," said the agency's interlocutor.
“In principle, instead, the FWG’s procuratorate could send representatives to the FIU or transmit written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that the issue should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag deputy Hans Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of hearing by the United States special negotiating services of the Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The C.I.A.'s ex-worker made it clear he knew a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival,” said the Euronews Trebele.
Snowen’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, commented on the Interfax source’s statement that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide for himself.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013 and then made available information on U.S. intelligence operations on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow through transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities, which had made serious accusations to him, and remained in the transit zone of Šeremetivo before early August.
On August 1st, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetjevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had arranged for a job at a major Russian company.
German media reported on the NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the chancellor's phone calls began to be heard by Americans back in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that the monitoring of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left Justice Russia.
The State Duma MP from the Justice Russia party, a member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the New Siberian regional office of the party.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of “justice. ”
We sit, we drink tea...
"Sometimes a lot of people want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomarev puts on the parbilette table," he commented.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the Esserian regional office.
However, there is no intention to waive the mandate of the Deputy Secretary of State, Ilya Ponomarev.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not get out of it by law.
Reports of the intention of Ili Ponomareva to leave the Party of Righteous Russia appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valeri Zubov would leave the SSR with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kissida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, on issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, he said at the meeting of Kissid.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in addressing complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding that the land lost after the Second World War be returned.
In the Japanese capital, vehicles are driven, with loudspeakers saying, "Return the northern territories!"
The police do not stop the protesters, and they are watching that noise levels are not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said boldly that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, an avid actor named Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the audience in conversation.
Fae's innovation has overtaken others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines Stadium Club, celebrates her tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these hedliners started in Carolines, and then they made more success, reached a level when they were already too famous to be in the club,” said Hirsch.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standap for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among other Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosby.
As the festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example through small TV shows like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got famous because of his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (notably the FXX League for Funtesi Football), and now runs his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slatt joined the cast both on Saturday night on live air and in "Parks and Zones of Rest", although she is most known for a series of viral casts "Marcelle-crap in Boots".
Croll, and Slatt, like other young comedians with their own style (Surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jesellnik, a vicious, racial-focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but then became a successful director of television and cinema, as well as an informal history of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when I came here, he sometimes walks around some alley between the two houses and thinks, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have initiated negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country to Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, visited.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on the negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to discuss Pakistan and India's relations with the world energy market and Pakistan's economic reforms.
“The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban had begun,” said a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with Pakistan's Constitution,” the diplomats added.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehriki-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but act independently in the north-western areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Islamabad Government had previously attempted to begin negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had been denied dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities took the troops to permanent locations located in Taliban-based areas and released the arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large stocks had darkened the message showing that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. oil class in December was priced 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for a later morning in European time in e-commerce on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract cost 39 cents, which amounted to a fall of 5.8 per cent for October.
Rich oil stocks have affected its value in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy stated that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, stocks were over 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports about the Chinese industry, which demonstrated the rise in its activity.
This suggests that China ' s economic recovery may continue to take effect after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent oil — a benchmark class of international oil used by U.S. oil refineries — cost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The head coach, “Colorado” by Patrick Rua, explained his decision to release Golicoper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in a Friday match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that the last night behind the bars did not waver his confidence in the Russian, he passed on from Dallas to the Socre “SE” by Natalia Schmeleva.
What do we have to wait for, Rua said after the morning break of Lavin?
Of course, all of us are concerned about what happened, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be helpful for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to get on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely certain that the situation has not affected the condition of the concierge?
We'll see about that today.
Surely our players will support Varley by helping him to protect the gate, as it was in previous matches this season.
Mainly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be a vegan: a warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a reporter from RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely renounced their products of animal origin must not live in Siberia.
They can't carry the winter here without losing their health, and no heat tomatoes can compensate them, according to the New Siberian Dietologists and doctors interviewed the day before Vegan Day.
Drinking butter with liters
Strong vegetarianism, when not only meat and fish are abandoned, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, the diethologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, adherence to such strict standards of nutrition is at least useless for health.
Complete abandonment of animal products.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plantation.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet,” is a confident nutritionist Marina Bogay.
It gives an example of fish containing the indispensable fatty of Omega-3.
The most abundant of their oil is linen.
"To need it for human consumption, you have to drink a liter!" says the nutritionist.
The medical community is confident that the people of Siberia should pay particular attention to the diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly questionable during this season.
In our reality, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, you need increased calorieity.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, therefore, he is not picking up the calories,” says the expert.
This is accepted by the doctor-diethologist Olga Pozniak.
It adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better to feed primarily on foods grown in the region of residence or where it was born.
The genetic code is geared towards better learning and digestion of these products.
And in the winter, people want not a cucumber to bite, but a hot soup or something more positive," explains the doctor.
She said that from what vegans may be, various grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is certainly not enough for a full meal.
According to a gastroenterologist, Klaudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in Siberians is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees per day and snow in May, is useless.
The body needs energy to live, especially fat," says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, need building materials, including amino acids.
And with vegetarianism, we give them to the underprivileged.
Pregnant women also need higher protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"Vegans don't get them," I'm sure.
Arifulin says that an adult is willing to choose whatever he wants to play the toys he wants.
He's already got an organism, a skeleton, organs.
Still, children must eat fully.
If parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he will eat for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substances for brain development, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of heat and imported vegetables and fruits grown in winter.
What is brought to us in the heat also contains less micronutrients than we need in the open ground.
"The quality of the produce isn't," says God.
Arifulin also notes that import and thermal vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest more crops is damaging to quality.
“The apples do not become brown on the cutting, the cucumbers are quickly yellowing and molding, the tomatoes are tasteless and non-artificial” - gives examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be soaked in excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cages.
This is not accepted by the employer of the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Problems, candidate of the sciences of Vera Petruk.
She said that full vegetables could be cultivated in a proper manner and in compliance with all the standards and requirements in the greenhouses.
If they try to drive more from the square meter, of course, hunting will become more frequent and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers are grown quickly, they are large but watery and unsweet", she explains, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended enforcement of the “stop-and-go” decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the New York Police Department ' s "stop-and-go" programme and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the constitution as it carried out a programme on street detention and interrogation.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective decisions, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police department in changing its practices and associated training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on a motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because she had violated the US judges ' code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid displaying bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unduly addressing blacks and Latin Americans on the “stop-and-go” programme.
She appointed an external supervisor to oversee the large-scale changes that included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras on the police stations where most of the detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of keeping the names and addresses of the people whose cases had been terminated after the police inspection.
The city appeal debate is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The Circumstance has been in practice for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, brought a collective action before the court.
The supporters of the change in the “stop-and-go” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and can affect the way other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the fighting spirit of police officers rather than the level of crime, result in unnecessary spending of money and do not solve the more global problem of complex police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stopping-and-seeing” which was consistent with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Triciakova Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretlyakov Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokusnitskaya Metro Station to the Bolotna Square.
All the time, street towels, florists, benches, urns and toilets have been installed, deaf blankets and illegal advertisements have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushinski alleys that were already pedestrians, five streets of Ordinsky were closed to vehicles, the Big and the Little Tolmachev alleys, the Kadshev Coast and the Bolt Square.
There are no restrictions on the movement of transport along the streets of Morocco and Petrovka.
At the section of the St. Petersburg Street from the Novakusnitskaya station to Klimentov Street, the pedestrian conditions were created without taking off the traffic and cutting down the carriageways, passing newsmsk.com.
Within the pedestrian zone was the Triciakov Gallery, the priestess’s temple of Clement of the Pope’s, the museum, the library, monuments, and other sights.
In the past, the Tver Pass, Stolešnikov alleys and Kuznetska Most street were completely on foot.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone break-in to verify a confidential message
The former newspaper editor, News of the World Andy Coulson, allegedly used “the break-in of the phone, surveillance and opposition” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke, who then served as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's Attorney Andrew Edis, informed the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with Hannah Polby's “attractive special adviser”.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcair to break into Polby’s voice mail and checked her home to get an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, ” he heard the court.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will be standing next to someone's house, hoping to find someone suddenly, is the person who likes to offer history to people to see what they will say,” said Mr. Addis.
He said that the News of the World has used three ways of investigating history: telephone break-in, surveillance, and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the burglary of the phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumors of Clark's novel for the first time drew the attention of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voice tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister were listed as Project.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
Having left a voice message to her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow, which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Addis said that Coulson's involvement in this history was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blanckett.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blanckett about an affair with a married woman while he met Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny collusion with other people with a view to breaking and entering telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeir, Thurlbek, and Wezerap confessed to a phone break-in.
Snauden declares readiness to communicate with the authorities of the FWG in the hearing case
C.I.A. Officer Edward Snowden is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the FRG authorities, he is transmitting RIA Novosti.
A letter from the former CIA officer to the FWG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented a letter from the Bundestag of Hans Christian Strebel, through which Snowden transmitted a message to the German authorities.
He had met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on Tver Street
Four passersby were injured as a result of a fire in a tower in downtown Moscow on Tverska Street.
According to Interfax, referring to a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured during the fire in a smoked underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti, referring to the head of the capital department of fuel and energy, Paul Livinsky, electricity has now been completely restored in all the houses on Tver Street.
There was a fire in a heat station near house 15 on Tver Street on the evening of 31 October.
A strong smoke came out of the meadows of the rainwater, and smoke came from the underground passage at the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were demolished on Tver Street.
At 21:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
United States dollars cut off food aid for the poor
Food allowance for the family of four decreases by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial security of food vouchers known as “fudstempas” has been reduced as the relevant State programme is being completed.
The family allowance of four will now be $36 a month less than before, according to officials.
This will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012 the one-person benefit was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by “foodstamps” that have been named since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress require further reductions in the funding allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
Food shop owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
United States congressmen continue to argue about the possible further reduction in funding for the Government.
Blizzard released the 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard studio released its Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC in 1994.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his report, the game was made available in Battle.net in the Blizzard Classic Games section.
However, some gamers point out that only those users whose accounts are part of the American service are currently able to download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
Soundtrek to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, initially appeared on the SNES console.
His events were unfolding on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
On one occasion, the dark ruler of Sarlak decided to kill the light king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vloros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Sarlak's supporters and protect the inhabitants of the world from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game the studio released after its name was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
The label Blackthorne was an Interplay company.
There will be new machine guns in the Moscow metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers is not for money, it's for sitting down.
One trip worth 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of meetings will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamlodchikov, will receive the presentation of the new tickets.
National Security Agency confessions reinforce the paranoia of corporations with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s capital.
Following instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, it was tasked with photographing the U.S. office roof, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV hoped to find listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US did not use the possibility of external intelligence “to steal foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract worker who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer confident that the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored Brazil's Petrobras oil company and had access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, had raised the paranoia of corporations caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was a notification that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was being tapped for maybe ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY consulting agency in July.
However, all documents that Mr. Snowden has revealed have so far failed to show that the United States has passed on the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain opportunities in the area of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we must create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical development of U.S. intelligence agencies, known for their discoveries, has been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China ' s greatest risk of surveillance was.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European corporate leaders are better aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of a cloud provider in the United States after the disclosure of the American programme for intellectual data analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What happens to economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
“It has been discussed for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bok, CEO of BASF Chemical Company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to brag about the responses they have taken, as this can give the opponent an advantage.
The idea of taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room was long ago.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a board member of the Audi Automobile Directors, says that for many years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that business leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently dropped.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to burglaries and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns BfV.
United States dollars warn their own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report put France, together with Russia and Israel, into a second set of hackers for economic intelligence, after China, claims The Washington Post.
A board member of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, French is the worst.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy for their allies.”
The parents of a young woman in Georgia who died “incredulously by accident” believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a young woman from Georgia whose body was found inside an abandoned sports mat in his high school sports hall believe that their son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Waldosta State of Georgia was found on 11 January in a vertically standing mat, leaning behind the stands in the sports hall of his secondary school.
The officers of the Lawdes County Sheriff's Department concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old disputed this.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Cramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics and common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover for protecting a man or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to them in a body bag," he said.
US attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday day.
I'll learn all the facts wherever they're going.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I hold the view that there is sufficient ground” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsy revealed that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to request a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lawdes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when he was approached Thursday.
On Wednesday, Judge South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all video surveillance cameras viewed by investigators.
The teen parents said they hoped that the videos contained the key to how he died.
“Spartak”: For information on the persons who exhibited Fascist symbolism
A statement by the Moscow Club regarding the appearance of the Fascist flag in Jaroslavla appeared on the official website “Spartaka”.
On October 30, unknown provocators at Jaroslavla Stadium demonstrated Fascist symbolism.
We ask all who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
“Remuneration is guaranteed”, said the statement.
Finding fans hanging a Fascist flag in Jaroslavla
Let us recall that in match 1/16 the finals of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" "Spartak" were interrupted several times because of riots on the stands.
In the Spartacus hospital sector too, Fascist symbolism was demonstrated.
In the form of the punishment “Spartak” can hold about three matches without spectators.
A meeting of the Committee will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried out this symbolism, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on Allergy in Children
On Wednesday, disease control and prevention centres published a list of recommendations for monitoring child allergy in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the United States Government, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has an allergic reaction.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that the prevalence of food allergy among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The management provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff of food allergies in children and how to assist in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — most commonly used for injections by an automatic EpiPen syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to supply less-difficult adrenaline.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “a feeling like something is speaking in my language”, “a feeling that I have hair in my language” or “a tongue of pinches”.
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Choose “Uncertain Sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with external intermediate sex organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to identify sex as “undetermined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the Act was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the adoption of a newborn, and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
An intersexual man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I am not a man or a woman.”
I'm going to be a doctor-designed handicraft with bruises and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexual developmental disorder” — a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ejacles or seeds) or unusually developed sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification has not been sufficiently studied yet, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child prior to the operation, if any.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law would “sound like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not," he said.
You can assign a sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It's like a riddle about why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as distinct from transsexual or transgender, since their condition is not gender related but biological, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of either at the same time or not.
These characteristics may appear in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair covering distribution, breasts and bodywork; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudiced crime.
The boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Uelby, became the world's first person to be recognized as a “undetermined” sex status in court for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F — X, which is intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still at odds, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this strongly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, wrote that “in situations where the world is dragging into a new state where the sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed Baby Zone that she would prefer children to establish sex at birth.
“Creating a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had both sex marks.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw a gender as a leaf on which to wipe everything and then paint it again.
But now many argue on ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult and that doctors sometimes make wrong choices, not knowing how the child will perceive the gender he has been assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called an “immediate psychiatric event”,” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who felt that a gender could easily be changed.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social signs — as parents grow a child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during negligence, to completely castrate the child, removing his eggs, and growing it as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “applicing this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-change operations claimed to be “dissatisfied with the result”.
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer in Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and he was convinced that he would never be able to live the “full life” of a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital and ovum were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginalplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone shots and removing his breast.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to rule people's perception of intersexuality.
But Ann Theor-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “increases the hanging of labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child “uncertain sex”,” she said.
We fear that he will facilitate intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Subjector Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third sex”.
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she said.
The German law implies its assignment at birth.
This is a fight that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a Pittsburgh mammologist who has a daughter with sexual development impairment who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “a complete withdrawal syndrome to androgens”.
As its endogenous receptors are malfunctioning, Katy developed female symptoms.
She has a pool, but she has no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29, Cathy's married and attending the Children's Psychiatric Office at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite her infertility, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and analysis in the situation, as well as the time before they write “men” or “women”.
In such a case, you are fine — growing up a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents have because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which sex he or she is more comfortable — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Chicago doorman Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understood that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six dates from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth miss team.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I have failed to do so, bringing the CSNChicago words of Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I guess I should approach them as a game, and try to get a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel quite good at training.
But somehow after a few heads, everything turns into a snowman.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The doormen, I don't think I'm alone, they're always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens at my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many shifts.
Well, it's great that my teammates support it, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
On Altay, a bus changed.
In the Rubtsov region of Altay region, a PAZ flight bus changed.
As a result, 13 people were reported injured at the regional administration of the CDM, according to the updated data.
Earlier, 10 victims had been reported by law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the road Novonikolaevka Vishnevka, 1 km from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all injured and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to City Hospital No. 1 Rubtsovska and two persons were hospitalized in the CRB Rubtsovska.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be deployed to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe once they have been established in Latin America and Asia.
“We expect that we will receive a total of more than 170 copies of such aircraft,” says Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
Today, we have discussed some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be distributed to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will come to France someday," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Dry Civil Aircraft Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high quality and comfort standards in the 100 passenger seats segment.
The energy of Dnepropetrovina has launched a unique rescue program... asist nests
In the old age to draw the asists to the courtyard, the peasants on the high pole mounted a wheel of a cart, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special resistance has long been lacking, so the Aist loved the pillars of the electricity lines, and the wires were intertwined, making the house secure.
Anja’s grandmother, near her home in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky, has been home for twenty years to an austere family, began to notice the nest sitting despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches over the top, and the bottom layer is already between the wires, it's about to collapse.
Of course, it is unfortunate for the family of Asians who nested at the yard every year, dragged out and fed three or four birds in the summer, but without light, they do not want to remain.
As soon as the birds flew into the warm country, Grandma Anja called the Czarican RES, which had its support.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, said Dtek Technical Director "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezowski.
On wires that were actually within a nest weighing between 150 and 200 pounds [150 - 200 kg], corrosion began.
At any time, the birds could have died of electrical discharge.
Even locals risked losing light because of damage to wires.
This is why liners began a nest rescue operation, not the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnepropetrov National University helped develop a nest transfer scheme.
They also trained district network staff.
A well-known Dnepropetrovian ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, consulted energy at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 genuine “housing” units in the area of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were constructed that resemble a crow.
The foundation was paved with Jewish branches, and then an old nest was moved there.
According to the signs, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for birds to know the nest and return to it.
After that, the Aist builds their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovi district.
Next to the power station, a new iron pillar was placed and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation went into the energy supply of nine thousand bracelets.
The same new village was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky in the courtyard of Ana’s grandmother.
Here, the platform was installed in the old place, only to lift the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartment has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, four more nests in Dnepropetrovska and Pochrovské and Czaricánské areas were waiting for the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
In the afternoon, the whole area was filled with sad news - in the village of Ust Kamenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers fired at the swan family in the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds did not fear the people, nor did they harm the locals.
When the villagers heard the shots, they fled to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now the Apostolic Police Department is investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
Russian March is getting more popular.
On 4 November, the Day of National Unity, Moscow will be hosted by the Russian March Ministry.
According to the poll, the support of the Russian Marches is growing -- already 40 per cent of citizens agree with the idea of conducting them in different ways.
According to Leevada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens agree to various degrees with Russian marches: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “very positive”.
The popularity of the Russian March idea is gradually growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these actions in 2006, and more than twice as many citizens (28 per cent) have supported such activities in December 2010.
“Adequately negative” to “Russian marches” refers to only 7 per cent of Russians, “probably negative” 19 per cent.
Another 35 per cent were unable to express their views on the stock.
This year, the Moscow Ministry agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, reported today to the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist campaign has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Have you heard that on 4 November, Russian marches are held under Russian defence slogans in Russia?" Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Only every fifth Russian (20 per cent) is aware of this stock.
It is remarkable that in December 2010 almost one third of the citizens were heard on Russian Marches (31 per cent).
Let us recall that three years ago, a natural nationalist rally was held on 11 December, which turned into mass riots.
Levada Centre also asked the Russians what celebration was celebrated on 4 November.
Within two years, the number of people who know the right answer (Country Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
In fact, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate this celebration.
About the same (17 per cent) intends to celebrate the October Revolution Day on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to observe any of these holidays.
As Moscow City Hall agreed to "Russian March" in Lubino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublin.
The leader of the Russian association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demuskin, reported on this.
In addition to the march to Lublin on People's Unity Day, there will be a rally and a concert by the Kolovat Group, also agreed with the authorities.
How did "Russian March-2012" go?
On National Unity Day, in 2012, nationalists took a walk from the Jakiman Coast to the Central Artist's House, where the rally took place.
The organizers evaluated the number of participants in 20,000, the IMF called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s pre-election headquarters considered the exception of Baden in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's next advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This opening is the brightest sensation from all of Mark Halperin's expected books and John Hailemann's 2012 campaign, "The Staves Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times had received a copy of the book to be published and reported on Thursday evening that the President's closest assistants had conducted “large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exception of Baden could help to raise the hopes for the re-election of Obama.
According to political commentator The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior election chiefs and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration Bill Daley, to assess the effect of voting on the appointment of former Secretary Clinton Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded headquarters in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only six of the President’s closest advisers — including Daley, former head of the election headquarters of Obama Jim Messin, and former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Staves Doubled states that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “close personal relationships”, but eventually refused to take that step when the data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not “improve Obama's substantial chances”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, the Administration had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I have actively advocated many things, and this was one of them,” said the Daily newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested quite a lot in examining whether this step would bring the dividend to the vote.
“The election headquarters do not spend that kind of money on interviews and focus groups if they do not take something seriously,” said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of substitution.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his boss at the time about a possible move.
Although he said that he did not think that the president had been “aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that “probably”, Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double stands" did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political probe had reached Obama.
Cooper asked Martin if he took it seriously that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baden from the electoral list.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Would you like a light in the dark of the ice?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the world with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically restore the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts to the language of the eater by increasing the pH of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "I'm delicious," says, "it's an amazing thing, but it's still at the very beginning of production, so for £200 you get about 2 g of substance."
The protein that we use in ice cream reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it increases your pH and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it was creating such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because jelly luminescence is four times the price of gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
That's why it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of dry gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
That's not possible by definition because of the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The coach "Avangarda" Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL champion against Salavat, noted that the latrines conducted a thorough analysis of the impact of the M.M. Metallurga.
The specialist stressed that Avantgarda should be given more attention to the defence game.
We watched a video match against the Magnetic Metallurg, bringing in the official "Avantgarde" website of Chebaturkin.
- Missed a lot of screws, not a good time.
They missed out on their mistakes because of the failure of the game.
We knew that the rival had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on their way, and they killed three of us.
That's a very good realization.
These mistakes were taken into account in preparing for today's game?
You know, every game we play, every match we get, we talk after the game, we get ready for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is being executed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was done, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the "in the locker room" goal, and in the third period they started making mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, he did not see the point of joining the defenders.
We need to defend ourselves as a team.
Now, Avantgarda has a long home series, matches go in a day, the team's tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of its moments and the performance of the game.
Hockkey is an emotional game, if you're running an installation, it's not that difficult.
Because of the new rules imposed by the Russian Customs, hundreds of vans have been in line for almost a week at the Russian border.
Today, donor officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to establish biotuallets
Hundreds of furs were dug at border crossings as they entered Russia.
Such a situation arose as a result of changes in the rules of the customs administration of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm: the turn has created a Russian side that has not previously warned about innovations.
Since 28 October, Russia ' s Customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of the goods, Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of Customs, reported.
The new model document is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Access points are in enhanced mode.
FACTOV correspondent visited the border and contacted the long-distance hostages.
Prices in the shopping mall at the Novoazsk Pass are rising with each day, as is the case with the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, about two kilometres apart.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Veselo-Vesenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine along the international highway.
From here the goods are sent to Stavropolský kraj Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, they were still on the air, and after the rules had been introduced, Alexia Golovanev, a long-distance murderer (on a photo), who is carrying cargo through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is being carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1100 - 1300 bracelets).
Those who drive nearby (e.g. Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 rubles) and drive.
And the rest of them are stuck. Nobody has that kind of money.
You can imagine, if a driver carries a load of only $4,000, but not to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (for 23 thousand bracelets) to pay for his transit!
There are no conditions for survival on the border, and there are long-distance fighters who are sitting next to their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but prices like this are nowhere to be found!
The sellers focused and quickly developed them: 15 bracelets are worth a pound, seven bracelets a cup of coffee, 25 bracelets a plate of soup.
It's just a coffee shop.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the steppe, we're going to the bathroom.
Don't wash, don't shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife set me up.
For a week now, it's comfort to have another long-distance fighter named Victor Scottarenko.
Will my car be here in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water?
There's 11 and 15 bracelets.
What, is the crystal bottle, or is the water solid on the silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take something else while you're at it, mates the seller.
After the situation began to be covered by the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was highlighted by the authorities in the region.
The management of the Amvrosievsky and Novoazov Raigosadvices has been entrusted with the task of ensuring to all those who are on the line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, - the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Obsadamia Sergey Dergunov stated.
The ambulance crew is now on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotuallets will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the orderly problem will be solved in the coming days.
As reported by the Donetsk Oblast Administration, 32 and 68 vehicles were used as at 31 October in the “Spenka” and “Novoazovsk” international passes, respectively.
FACTS will follow developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-level individuals of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made by the BNS Agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, according to the report, Moscow is going to “speak” to President Dalu Gribauskait of Lithuania and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhiwa concerning facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence department, the Department is conducting an analysis of the public processes of the administration of the Russian President on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the meeting of the Lithuanian People's Party.
A member of the operation is also allegedly a member of Department B. Smirnov.
Smirnov, according to the Special Service, had regularly arrived in Lithuania under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012, and had been in contact with local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the territory of the country.
Earlier, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskate, stated that he knew of the information available to him.
In her view, Lithuania's successful Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country's tendency to energy independence was the main reason for its success.
The Lithuanian leader had not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
Thus she stated that the Kremlin referred to Lithuania as “not enough respect”.
In addition, Gribauskate accused RF head Vladimir Putin of referring to Lithuania of “one claim only”.
Remember, in September, Rossabnadzor suspended imports of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products did not conform to sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare a WTO appeal.
In the United States, the school director fired at adolescents.
A director of an American secondary school literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
There was an incident in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw away a man's home with toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened fire on teenagers, causing several injuries to his leg and a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the property of the Director, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail at $125,000.
Notably, shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Literally before that, a man opened fire in the middle of Ridgecrest, California, straight through the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to hide.
Earlier, shots were fired at Newtown primary school, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at school, she was a tutor.
U.S. School shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
Dynamo's throwing a free electrician in Himki for a Tomie match.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat confetti, to stay up late, and to make a masquerade for our area.
I'm more of a circle now.
I haven't been invited in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't be able to do it this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow with regard to Halloween.
According to the National Trade Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on confetti, costumes, and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Trade Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion in $6.9 billion.
This year, sexual inanimate objects peaked.
Women are no longer required to be members of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to "The Walking Dead," and I'm sure the Daft Punk cosmonauts will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
Google reports that costumes most often sought are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we were not alone.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Retail Trade, Americans will spend $330 million this year on domestic suits.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to the confetti, we don't get to brag.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds confetti, Twizzlers and Clark Bar cans.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million children demanding confetti who are prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — not fool ourselves — 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we do not want to use is corn confetti; yet, according to the National Contestants Association, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween like a ghost house.
They have amazing names, such as “Wizard Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “Woe and cry” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghosts generating about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described what your friend put on Facebook, and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment as a “class expression”.
And finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tikwa when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the fad on the pumpkin started last year only with Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out the pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly exhaling on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew to 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their zucchini weight at £2032.
The Estonian Mine Defense Site was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after cyber attacks in the morning, according to the agency's press service.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Information and Administrative Affairs Timear Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with large quantities of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, so far the site has been restored.
“The Ministry’s damage is minimal,” said the Postimees publication.
According to Peterkop, it's too early to talk about who staged the attacks.
“We must analyse the causes of the incident and make our conclusions out of it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents altogether”, he acknowledged.
On November 1st, the Anonymous Ukraine Group posted on the network, which confirmed the hacking attack on the Estonian Mini-Defense site and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," says an anonymous statement.
Previously, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the Marine Company of the feudal separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would participate in the NATO response force command and staff exercises Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the violence of the unclean force, several schools and hospitals had to be shut down.
Four schools in Zimbabwe, South Matabeleland, had to be shut down because students were attacked by goblins.
As the local elder said, the children were panicking, and continuing the course proved impossible.
The Goblin story may sound like the invention of a child for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close the school.
Adults too fear unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital closed in Zimbabwe because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover race release announced
Inside there are race seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communications system.
It is also possible to obtain upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between activities.
Drew Bauler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rallyers turning to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but those seeking excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines of rallying in Britain and abroad, as well as prepare participants for difficult conditions and the reality of rallying.
We were very happy to design the Defender Challenge car — it would be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian forces are not aware of anything about the "Brath Circle" group - New Reports
This is reported by INTERFAX.RU, referring to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the RF.
“After media reports of U.S. Finance Ministry Lepsa's listings on suspicion of belonging to the Euro-Asian Criminal Union 'Brath Circle', we have reviewed all the databases, but we have not found such groups,” said the agency's interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helped maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously said “NI”, yesterday the U.S. Ministry of Finance published a list of alleged members of the "Brother Circle" criminal group on its website.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
It's listed as "Grisha" before.
The data from a popular Russian enforcer coincides.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others are mentioned.
Two Russian nationals, an Israeli national, a Uzbek national and another former USSR national whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, we are confident that Gregory Lepps, who lives on the island of Phuket, was carrying money for the bandits on their order.
This report is accompanied by a photo of the singer and contains all his data that are valid.
Moreover, Leps recently bought a house on Phuket.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a person on American Minfina's blacklists is causing the blocking of his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
Lepsa's assistant, Maya Serikov, stated that there were no notifications to the singer: "It's difficult to answer the question whether it's Grigory everyone's talking about right now in connection with the U.S. scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
There were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they occur in such cases.
“And, of course, it’s all funny on the one hand and, on the other hand, surprising and unexpected,” she said RIA Novosti.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live on Phuket, but according to Minfin U.S., he does have a house on a Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news had caught him during the flight to Blagovestensk.
He ran out of the field in Shinnik's match.
Some details of the fan's personality have become known during match 1/16 of the Russian Cup final between Jaroslav "Shinnik" and Moscow's "Spartak".
According to CDC head Artur Grigoriantz, referring to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the hospital is Moscow.
He's currently under arrest.
"In addition, Grigorianz described how a fan managed to break through the field: "It has been found that this, called by the viewer, went to the rescue of two viewers, referring to the heart problems.
He's coming to an ambulance. That's what the doctor told us soon.
Then he pushed the two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is a stewardship area - the police cannot interfere with what is in the field.
He made it to the rostrum, crossed the eastern rostrum.
And at that time riots began on the Eastern Court and on the escape routes," the head of the CDC said.
Let us recall that by the decision of the CDC, Moscow's Spartacus will hold the 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiva and Zenita without viewers and will pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire teams were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career retreat.
Cocker Spanish Ruby ran off after she got into a small car accident.
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, she was spotted by a man walking a dog.
The firemen came down on a rope on a long slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was happy to be rescued after fire teams were summoned to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after somehow he was stuck at 50 feet on the dangerous retreat of the suspension slope.
Nine months of gambling with Ruby ran away after she got into a car accident on Sunday, and she spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her boss, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fluppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They feverishly sought out their missing dog and placed it on social media sites after she fled to her career after a small accident.
At approximately 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a star dog’s guide spotted Ruby, standing 50 feet [50 feet] high on a career retreat.
The technical rescue unit from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transfer to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she's totally numb.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is amazing.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, "Ruby is very lucky that she was rescued."
It was likely that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found that she was fine, except for depletion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching for salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The vet said that if she'd hung up and lost consciousness, she'd probably have fallen.
The fires were great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson of the city of Kitley added, “We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there”.
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't playing with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at the Australian Radio Show this week, pop stars stated that she was a back-vocalist for Jagger's 2004 Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and said, "He played with me when I was 18. "
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of the seventies-year-old Jagger said that he “categorically denies that he has ever hit Katie Perry”.
The representative added, “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else”.
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives Scottishs a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with barbed wires along the Adriatic.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movement in the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member countries are spending a lot of time turning their formal rules back as they please.
As Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So that's not a worthy story.
And so old that she became fossilized: for the first time, I heard an announcement that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting moment lost in telling an old story.
Why does independent Scotland have to obey Europe’s commands?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels, especially now?
This is real European news: the great post-war plan to bring Europe together has finally stalled.
With European crisis, Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposing the EU or cancelling the euro as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptics Party “Alternative for Germany”, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the Free Democrats (an analogue of our Liberal Democrats) out of Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to establish a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working in excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members in exchange rates for German exporters — that German policies and that they want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a disadvantage in comparison with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public expenditure, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of the budget and the currency are driven by a deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy package introduced by Brussels — a cipher meaning the subsidisation of French and German energy companies by the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralyzing price environment, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the devastating defeat of the US’s cheap salt gas over the European oil and gas industry.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, once the fiercest advocate of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and bring Paris to the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and it has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress.
The result is the right-wing EU party Marin Le Pen, the National Front, has just won decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling party of socialists to third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of the votes — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that the split between the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Penn do with its new popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the next year's EU elections to build a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the parties against the EU receive support in these elections, such a bloc will for the first time be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
I believe that the growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a vague Europe of sovereign nations, which the General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific shows the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what situation does it leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed in a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other conglomerate countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, as strangely as it is, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011, thanks to objections to the cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of thorian and liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be foolish to vote for independence only in order to take measures of strict savings imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Maturity: Ageing Earlier
African American and Latin American girls tend to have sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the starting mechanisms of early sexual maturity
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
A former CNN correspondent, Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in child health and family matters.
Should the mother be intimidated if her daughter starts forming breast cells and growing brow hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time resting my parents — usually does not mean the rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, brow and braiding and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it goes to at least two or three years before the Menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book Early Sexual Maturity of Girls: How to Cope With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate examination of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes a de facto attack on sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow or stop — that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can be the basis for an endocrinologist ' s analysis to eliminate serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to slow growth and low growth at a mature age.
The recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is careful with drugs, but recognizes that “the suppression of sexual maturity can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls, that they are different from peers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with hygiene issues," Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began her menstruation when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many published theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual references in the media are responsible.
Boys — like girls — have sexual maturity earlier.
Kaplovitsz claims that the assumption that has the highest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which links the body's fat to sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls tend to have sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
All around the world, early sexual matrimony seems to be affecting everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
It is also a mystery that while boys have hair on their faces and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual maturity is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of the age of agers and menstrual hair are exposed to the appearance of adhering and brow hair.
“We have to be careful about how we determine the true attack of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child’s endocrinologist at the children’s hospital in Gorieb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who thrive early need proof that even when this is earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
US Boeing, stuck in Reading, is preparing to take off
The Open Sky Treaty observational flights over Russia and the unscheduled US aircraft landing in Reading on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's airspace.
The airport management authorized the boarding trip, receiving the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will take off at Ulan Ude.
According to other reports, he's going to the United States.
The Ulaan Ude aircraft reportedly landed in the Zabajkal region because of the mist.
Because of unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
On board the aircraft, 30 persons, including the crew, spent two nights in the airport, are reported by ITAR-TASS.
According to the IFA, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board aircraft are not allowed to go outside Chita Airport, they can only go through border control at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulan Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Observer flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, promote monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management in the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - IC in the U.S. IC
A high-income live celebrity rating in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her death income was 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
He is far behind from the other celebrities who have lost their lives, who have made “earned” a few times less.
For the second time, Elvis Presley, 55 million per year, followed by Peanuts Schulz’s comic book with 37 million, was on the list of the most successful celebrities that have been missing.
In addition to these, Elizabeth Taylor, who was a leader of 25 million last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million) entered the first Friday.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow
On 23 October, the first Flagman boutique, Igor Gulyaev, was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to a wide audience for his magnificent products from the Lux class fur.
And now they're going to be able to appreciate even more fashion admirers -- in Moscow, finally, his first boutique opened up, which is why the designer and staged a Dolce vita party.
I'm sure Russia has the most beautiful girls.
That's why I'm especially glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igor said. He cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to do... to illustrate the models!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are hostile to the width of the seat when on horseback large orders
There was a heated dispute between the main aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to passengers of an economy class whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for a sectoral standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic class salons, but its main American competitor, Boeing, said that this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of more and more versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft and potentially record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The back of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 people are in a row — is central to the economic efficiency of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in an economic class of more than 17 inches wide, located 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in an economy class on seats of 18 inches wide, 9 in a row.
Airplane giants often exchange technological strikes through commercial advertising.
Airbus is now making direct calls to the public before the Dubai air force, where 777X is expected to lead more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how the new ad war could start by showing the financemen a slide that depicts three people in a restaurant that was attached to each other, entitled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers far-track flights on seats lower than regional turbine planes,” said Airbus Sales Manager John Lichi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the flight seat has not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when broad-eyed Boeing 747 set standards for modern long journeys, and abroad, the average American male aged 40 to 49 grew by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The coverage of the waist of the middle American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist coverage of those recently referred to as the “reactive public” has already been.
Airbus said that she had ordered a study to show that an extra inch in the width of the seat improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing challenges the number of Airbus seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in the decision on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, research shows that the convenience of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s all about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said a specialist at Kent Crower Salon.
They do not want us to decide for them that they will gain.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
The dispute is followed by orders for aircraft estimated at at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, seat positions are precisely what warms up the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing both claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability in one place in their last two-engineed long-distance models compared to market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared features of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of the 10 series of 777X with the original 9-place layout of the series of constructive decision 777.
Winning at a specific cost decreases compared to the 10-place layout currently used.
“The reason why Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his plane more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full 10-row salons for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer flat landings, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seat of eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus offer is due to the threat from the 777th model,” said Salon interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver chairs, but offer a vendor catalogue from which airlines can choose.
The world - wide jets even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
Thanks to the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense combination of a salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but she says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional room modifications, offering more space for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the sole producer of major modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may divert attention from the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new antinicin vaccine can deprive you of the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an antinicin vaccine that could deprive the smoking process of pleasure cigarettes.
One dose of vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotinic addiction for life.
Further tests were needed prior to the start of human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Wayll Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have discovered that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of anti-anticonine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing them from receiving a nicotinic blow from the smoker.
In the test, nicotine-vaccinated mice continued their normal activities.
And mice who were not given the vaccine “were relaxed, ” and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brain, researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette to prevent nicotinic addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Olejnikov: one third of the rural settlements of Podmozkovy are fully subsidized
Vice- governor Yury Oleynikov said that nearly one third of Moscow's rural settlements were fully subsidized
Total grants from the region ' s budget receive 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent pre-financing.
In the area budget, some 25 billion roubles are channelled," said Olejnikov.
Also, the vice-governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mitiš, Odinsov and Pushkino - had more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The income of many rural settlements is less than 3 million roubles, “that is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative unit in the 88 settlements in Podmozkovya is over 70 per cent, “but there has been a decrease in the quality of services”, said Oleniki.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipal entities of Podmozkovya to consider before the end of November what settlements needed to be consolidated, merged into urban districts or changing the administration system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that the administrative reform in Podmozkovy planned to reduce the number of pre-dated rural settlements.
Also in Mozhai, Kashirsky, Solnečkarski, Cologne, Lubertzach and Kotelnikach, there is a request for the strengthening of municipalities.
Discussions will begin in the cities and regions of the region in November.
President Mosdalduma Igor Brinzalov also stated that about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmozkovya were planning to join the next Admiralty.
This is due to the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Podmozkov have an “acceptable” financial base and 100 are grantable.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diane Arbenin does not hide the great pleasure she enjoys in raising her children.
Even though Arben is now particularly time-consuming for creativity and public activity, she still finds it possible to drive with Martha and Artem, not only wasting time on their training but also entertaining as much as she can.
During the last week, Diane was twice accountable to her worshipers for her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook showing how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she played a fanat, showing how she put Artem and Martha on Halloween.
We're ready for the broom races! Our first Halloween" is what Diana called a picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
What is unwise is that, like any other Russian boys and girls, they have something to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany's first in Europe to introduce "uncertain gender" in registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to register children born to Germany instead of male or female, to indicate “uncertain”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the count “pol” in the birth certificate unfulfilled.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (men's) parents can write "X" (undetermined).
This decision is intended not to encourage parents to rush into a sex-specific operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are affected by Obed
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Trippi, will be the figure for investigating the anti-corruption oversight body of this state.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Trippi, rejects changes in the lease of maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeda, who secretly owned three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease to Serkyular Ki, where the Obydov family had two restaurants and coffees, without a tendering period exceeding in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Trippi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate following the testimony given by Mr. Trippi Linn Espoul's former Deputy Chief of Administration on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that rents should be presented for open competition.
The tenants opposed this and also sought longer leases.
In 2009, the rental contracts for Serkilar Ki, which brought the Obydov family about $2.5 million per year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripoli, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Trippi had acknowledged, urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
In August and September 2007, the IAC had provided a telephone decryption between Mr. Obejd, Mr. Tripoli and Steve Dann, the senior official who had come to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obyd's leadership in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone calls a matter of commercial lease policy development?” asked Mr. Trippi, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willy.
"No," Mr. Trippi replied. "
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not it.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obyd.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
The high-ranking administration officer at Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakiya on Thursday evening.
The clerk didn't specify what the target was, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the aim was rockets of Russian production SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried cargo aircraft carrying missiles inside Syria.
Foreign sub-class 457 workers may be tested for “plumbing”
A class 457 test of “plumbing” for foreign workers is under consideration by the Government, as it envisages an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied under the criteria to prevent the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the Government's rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying it might offend Australia's neighbours.
“Thinkings such as “foreigners — at the end of the line” and “the beginning of work for Australians” are a very unpleasant departure until trade unions demanded a secure labour market,” she said to the Institute “Australia — India” today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that had to be protected — and if some in the region saw the comments of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented contains 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of “substance” are accepted, the applicant may be examined for a visa “if the applicant is a genuine candidate in a situation where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of sub-class 457, since previously, enterprises intending to sponsor a small number of employees were then hired by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grieving nine - year - old son of this man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the Christmas hospital where he died.
A friend named Semen Varlamov stated that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgenia Vavrinyuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, the Russian News Service reports.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” said a woman in particular.
Let's remind ourselves that Waurinuk sued for beating up a holicypter of Russia by Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair and beat her, and her arms, chest, abdomen, and neck were damaged after the attack.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police station and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The Court did not restrict athletes in national movements, but prohibited them from approaching Wavrinuk.
He also faces imprisonment of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact on Scotland on the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project “will unite Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said he was “admirably” from the perspective of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Phase is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, requested HS2 Ltd to consider further improving railway capacity and reducing travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about transport links between cities; in Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “singlely” support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across Britain”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all and for the continuation of the Glazgo-Edinburg railway, already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the following steps.
Thorium is the new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Hydrocarbon incineration (where they are) has a negative impact on climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy is not the same, but it leaves behind a mass of expensive waste disposal.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendelay system.
It is found all over the world, and according to specialists, its fragmentation does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to switch off their boards and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers may already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required US airlines to carry out a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The civil aviation security management currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft”, he said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Office of the issue of resolution of the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer services now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes," the Spokesman said.
Qantas stated that it would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," she said.
The FAU regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study the FAU solution and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manual transport rules and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms its fleet’s variability, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones, at any height,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
Furthermore, according to the Panel ' s recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head is heard in Cuban anthem with notes of extremism
The football match between Angie and Cuba broke out in political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Region and Dagestani after the sufferers burned the Dagestani flag, and the Cuban anthem sounded different.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan, Ramadan Abdulatipov, invited the Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the hymn of the Krasnodar Region allegedly called for an international gap, inter alia, called for a war with “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, which has been approved by this anthem in 1995.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you as a mother, as an enemy, we go to the basurmanin, to the death fight," said the chairman of the Parliament, Hizri Shikhsaidov, in order to record such words in an hymn, to poison some of the believers."
Putin gained impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we know it today, Israel struck on Russian production missiles that were reportedly headed for Hizbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russian mediation that allowed the United States not to carry out the military operation to which they were closely approached this summer.
More details about the weapon and what all this means to the Syrian President will be told by our leading international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that Assad would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by midterm next year.
And today, it's a big scale.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn the declared chemical production plants.
A longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad days were considered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether or not this will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate, and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are disintegrated and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some people have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement was described as successful diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made an impression on a cooperative person.
Today, in Washington, the United States ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves to death, his mother is unlikely to be relieved that he has not been killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's holding on.
And he's changing his weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation established a separate Ministry of Construction and the JCC
Russian President Vladimir Putin has established a new Ministry of Construction and the JCC, and has proposed to head him to the ex-governor of Mikhail Province of Ivanov, Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Mene at the Novo Ogareva residence, and Men did not refuse to lead the new department.
Russian President Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman, explained that all the construction and construction functions and the JCCs were being transferred to the new Ministry from Minregion.
Mikhail Men is the son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Men, who finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleums named Mubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he has been elected to the Moscow District Duma from Sergio Posada, a member of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Government, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was Governor of the Ivanov Region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well, while middle class is having difficulties
At the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Gianani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter’s school education.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put there," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it deals, became the third pawnbroker registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A loan for jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, the pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent offered at the United Overseas Bank office, a local creditor with a branch office at the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness checks or wage evidence and can issue credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnshops because families feel pressured by the cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to compensate for income reductions as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in family credit, mainly due to increased mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared with 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely recovered from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“As prices rise, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Sung Sung Wun, CIMB economist, Malaysian Bank.
The record high prices of gold in the last two years have increased the pace with which people have set up their personal belongings because they have taken advantage of the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items laid at 200 Lombard sites of the city of the State are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put on a gold chain of grandmothers and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest Lombard operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months to up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnbroker business is such that ValueMax, the Bendemir office operator and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Jeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion by using 60 per cent of the S$66 million that this week as a result of stock placement on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors sparked a fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that lombard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase its direct debt.
“The clients establish items they already own and the monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she said.
The wage earns more and more public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
It is not just those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation that are used by the pawnbrokers.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices to install gold alloys or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include persons who have to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money really fast.
Today, the quality of medical care is important for the population, not the number of medical facilities available and their status.
The 2011-2013 Modernization of Tulu Health, the reorganization of our city's medical institutions, will provide an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and babies.
For example, after combining with the humpback, there was an even greater possibility of attracting narrow specialists from the NGC to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistics base of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards has been developed.
During these years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major renovations, and 112 items of equipment have been purchased for 42 million roubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive newborn post.
In an operating section of Caesarean, Sel-Sever is used to collect blood from an operating wound and, after special treatment, to restore it to its birth, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinic-laboratory diagnostic.
In the women ' s consultation, electronic registration is in place, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient history is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has provided an opportunity to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, births and newborns with regional professionals.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya borns were arrested by French police on suspicion of serial assault on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered a prostitute to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old convict of Chechnya.
Bavarian Protector David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by Marcel Hirscher, and the third was the ski lift with the trampling of Gregor Schlerenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian helped his team win the League of Champions, Champions and Cup of Germany, as well as in the UEFA Super Cub.
Archavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andre Chad.
Former citizen wife of Peter's Zenita football player Andrea Arshavin Yulia Baranovska is taking a vacation with actor Andrey Chadovy.
Julia rests in Italy with actresses Anastasia Zadrožna, her fiancé Sergei Slavnova, and Andrea Chadová.
Photos of joint walks of couples are published in Instagram Anastasia Roadside.
This is not the first joint photograph of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Roadway published a photograph of a couple standing on the banks of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenita's Havbek Andrey Archavin admitted that he lived separately from his wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrey Archavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
Recently, it became known that Archavin is dating an ex-model by Alice Kazina.
Archavin's new friend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasmania's health
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmanian health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pliebersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “timely measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the higher levels of chronic illness and the limitations of the system.
The decision to finance for four years was taken following the consultations of the Government with the independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has offered an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including cataract orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for non-prescription clinics in Hobart and Loneston to improve the quality of care after the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical maps in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to advanced doctors to implement ideas on how best to help Tasmania’s health system,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict reporting and accountability.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding to obtain Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it will spend these additional funds.
A commission of three will be established to ensure that the state provides services as effectively and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not solve anything, “unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his urgent request for assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the withdrawal of this state's health system from a critical state,” said Mr. Wilke.
According to the State Government, these additional sample procedures greatly compensate for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to that of the laity band”.
“The reason we are here is that the Labour State Government has ripped $430 million out of the health system,” ABC TV told the company.
When the state government takes nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it can't be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The expansion of Guillaume Nikla by the novel Danny Didro may boast of exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should be.
The film in France in the 1760s tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she has extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic superintendent and has become the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down until it comes down to or goes down — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test for both the dresser and the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons, the monitoring group said
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, an international observation group stated on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
the deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization to destroy or “make ineffective” all chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poison gas and to fill their ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting in the city of Safir on Thursday, where experts believe that chemical weapons are being produced and stored, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad ' s armed forces, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, there were 2,202 military fugitives and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
The Asada troops fought in Safire for several weeks against the rebels, many of whom were associated with the al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday but did not provide specific data.
The Boyi stressed the danger faced by chemical inspectors over the short term of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen the destruction of all the critical production and mixing/filling equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities were currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites, according to Syria, “have been moved to other designated sites which have been checked and abandoned and ... subject to the chemical weapons programme in which they are located”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the Safire site was one of the two places the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have shown all in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the Ahmet Uzumju Monitoring Group in the commentary published by the OPCW.
For the past third year, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mainly Sunni Muslims, the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its alavits sect, and the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other developments, Centre head Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defence site in the coastal province of Syria, Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over a conviction to terrorist organizers in Bali
The 202 survivors of the Bali bombing in 2002 responded furiously to the sentence handed down by the last of the conspirators who were brought before the court and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
A path that spent almost 10 years running as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for its role in the creation of explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including church explosions throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person named a “stunner” for his reputation as an explosive master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must be in front of the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched in a parked van immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack made by explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma three times a month, being connected to a life-sustainment system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the Jemah Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the bloody war — Amrosi, Muhalas and Imam Sabrada, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not that much.
The track is the last of the participants in the Bali terrorist attack to be brought before the court.
It hid for almost ten years, but eventually was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence evidence: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He did not give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret the grief he caused others.
The verdict is in advance of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
The path can still appeal against its sentence.
FAU: “Airport passengers can now use girlfriends on airplanes (but don’t call the mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Authority on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as this change takes place, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Worth at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAUs that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for flight crew members and device layout rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Despite the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAU.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, boards and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain is “well”.
Passengers must turn their devices off again when the aircraft is going down for landing and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and routing, the FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Engineers, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), this will be a win-win option”, Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling on-call when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or uploads will still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, boards and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no word with friends — an intellectual Internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when our case occurred: the actor was taken off American Airlines' plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on board.
More heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stored in the baggage compartment, because they can traumatize someone if they fly around the salon.
Cell phone calls on the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority on telephone calls is the Federal Liaison Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may lift a ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, National Transport Safety Expert CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“The cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know from the FCS that they can interfere with the cellular towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Branch Advisory Committee established by the FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAU has increased in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Democrat of Missouri, Claire McKaskil, argue that there are no compelling security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began limiting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigational and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech boyfriends at the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAU as sustainable to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are designed to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Uerta.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
Devices to read electronic books, for example, only emit minimum signals when listing pages.
But the signals get stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com was one of those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the entire airliner with their tools to read and fly Kindle's electronic books to verify the existence of problems, but never found them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices posed a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association stated that it considered interference from devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only separate reports from pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that FAUs allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during landings in conditions of limited visibility.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourism Industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards meeting passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving licence examinations
Driving licence examinations will be available for private companies with their own computerized highway.
This is referred to as “Commersant” with reference to the draft Government Decision “Omission to the Management of Vehicles”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only 30 such highways in Russia.
The students of such “privileged” schools are expected to count the results of internal testing.
The State Inspectorate will monitor the passing of the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the playground are not handed out from the first time, the school will be deprived of half-year privileges.
The technical requirements for roadways contained in the draft Government regulation have entered into force since 5 November 2014.
The project also contains training requirements for driving two-wheelers.
With effect from 1 January 2015, owners of motorcycles to receive category A rights will have to pass an examination in urban traffic.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transferred by air to a safe place from a drilling site in the North Sea, released back into the wild
A bird flown by air to the shore after being found exhausted at an oil summit in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was put in a helicopter flying to Aberdeen last month and then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) at the Rescue Centre in Alloa.
The manager of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: “It is likely that the water herd is a winter migrant from North Europe who has fallen into a strong wind zone above the North Sea.”
It appears that the bird has been able to find refuge on an oily eaves.
He said, "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for our help."
The water herder was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to gather business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and job creators want to see in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete interview of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the regulatory costs of Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the trading zone of Europe, even 40 per cent of large enterprises traditionally most European-minded of all companies agreed.
The last and most significant of all, our survey of business managers revealed that a clear majority wanted Britain to take the course of changing the treaty and its relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists on “significant change”, which will restore power back to Britain.
High rates - achieving treaty changes and a more favourable environment for Britain will result in a 16 per cent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces towards Britain.
The best conditions for the British business can and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and the results of our survey show that this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' normative activities.
U.S. Special Forces Listening to Pope's Personal Phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of American special forces.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that the US intelligence has been listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now very much in charge of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing the new pope was also under surveillance.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The service joined the cardinals ’ cell phones, which gathered in Rome to select a new pope.
The telephones of the residence where the members of the church lived were also heard.
The American spies listened to all the principal candidates on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the talks of the prelates until the end of the 12 March final.
In the United States, Argentine archbishop Bergolio has been claimed to be the future Pope of Rome since 2005.
The US intelligence also held talks related to the election of the new President of the Bank of Vatican City.
The Italian Journal states that the US Embassy of Rome continues to have a secret team of CIA and NSA operatives who are gathering information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, calmly announced that he was not concerned about the American shell, even if it was happening.
There are no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
A snowboarder for the Olympic Coupon was photographed specifically
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative banknote on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will already be held this winter.
Nominal of the coupons is 100 rubles.
But on the web, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic coupon on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknotes could be found in the photographs.
In particular, in the Free StockExchange photo repository, where the photograph is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in a photoshop lesson published on the Russian site Megaobzor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic banknote is in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, a species of the Olympic Stadium and Jar Bird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, the winner of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered, such as mountaineering, fristine and trampling skis, but eventually they chose snowboarding because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of “Investigation”, close to the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the widespread distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and are now studying the situation.
In Goznak, they're not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service, Gosznak Natali Nikiforova, stated to the News that all the discussions about plagiarism were ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the bills turns right, on the photos on the web to the left, - explained Nikiforova.
The man in the photo shoot to create the coupon was removed from various points, then the final image was chosen, and it is a typical snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist was paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion on the image in the Olympic coupon was positive.
The recognition of the image in the coupon - plus for its promotion - is considered by the Executive Director of the NP "Rus Brand" Alexey Popovicev.
It is difficult to prove the 100% similarity of the images in the coupon and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that claims to challenge intellectual property in this image will come.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China, and a commemorative banknote was released at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in 10 Yuan.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans made the Russians drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their allegations, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at an earlier level, at best.
Even though businessmen were initially counting on growth.
They are not successful this year: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewing companies, President of the Council of the Russian Beer Association, Isaac Sheps, spoke at the III annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith, “Towary of Daily Demand in Russia”, which had just ended in Moscow.
State regulation of the market was discussed.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 per cent, as the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry for the production and circulation of beer, a drink with a small amount of alcohol in recent years, according to Sheps.
In no country of the world has beer market been so severely restricted, the unforeseeable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified in combating alcohol abuse.
Pivovar visited that many of the legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, yet new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks had hit the beer producers more painfully since this year.
"We lost 35,000 users immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
For next year, brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic is the one Sheps said: the sale of a penny drink remains at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the product class for the mass consumer to the premium class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
However, the dramatic effects of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“As I have observed, the level of alcoholism remains approximately the same,” said Dr. Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of sick people who drink hard drinks and those who “set up” with spirit-containing tonesing drinks like Jaguars has grown, whereas ten years ago it was “beer” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford auto plant in Vyvologska.
As they say in trade unions, all the laid-offs were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing the production in the region is more pressing than the problems of workers.
Deputy ZakSa Regional Deputy Alexei Etmanov stated at the meeting that about 600 people had been reduced at the Ford plant in the Vyvologska.
According to him, it was in September that about 600 people left the factory for the voluntary dismissal programme, which was developed together with the organization ' s trade union.
Workers who decided to resign were offered “gold parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority have left jobs of their own volition.
However, according to Ethmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to limit it.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programmes of support for regional enterprises in difficulty," he explained, adding that the adoption of the budget did not take into account stagnation in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is neither refuted nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it does, we'll publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in the Venevolce are long overdue.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people were known in September.
The plant had previously claimed that the production of cars had been suspended.
The reason for the factory was called the decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, following nine months of 2013, Lenoblast's industrial output decreased by 5.4 per cent.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones will be available during take-off and landing
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of aircraft have been approved in the United States, according to BBC television.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and boards throughout the flight, and new rules will be in force by the end of 2013.
However, the internet connection for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights at a height of less than 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of interference with the radio equipment of aircraft, hundreds of voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers of the airlines are allowed to read electronic books, play games on boards and other boyfriends and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will have to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the likely impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft management.
According to the source, for example the United States will also be able to revise existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights.
The Russian Mafia in the United States has finally established the new name "Brother Circle"
This week, a blacklist of Russian mafias in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the Bratsky Round.
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of carrying money for the group.
In the United States' blacklist, however, 22 persons associated with the Brotherly Circle and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
“The 'Brother Circle' declaration is more based on an attempt to bring together different criminal groups,” said the expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti of the University of New York.
In his view, "Brother Circle" reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, Mr. Galeotti quoted the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime as saying.
Mr. Galeotti also agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley.
“If they work together, it’s more like a criminal network but not an organization”, the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime says.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that "Brath Circle" is more of a Russian thief in the Aslan Usoyan law known as Deed Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
For example, Lashi Shushanashvili and Zacharia Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely associated with Dede Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was represented by Santa Hassan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all more united in common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in "Brother Circle" of Gregory Lepsa, the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew the Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner countries, and that is why such a decision has been made,” said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
Like all citizens of the RF, their interests will be protected.
Gazprom head Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The launch of the Southern Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today, there has been a sign event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Gazprom, Alexey Miller, in his statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is intended for Europe, increases the risk to normal routes, officials say.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated “always”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Saratsk area, a passenger from Peugeot drove off to the front lane at 115 km of the Odessa-Renie route, and encountered a bus containing six people.
This is reported by the HSMS management press service in Odessa.
As a result of the accident, a 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were killed.
The doctors gave the woman first medical treatment on the ground, and she refused hospitalization.
Emergency medical personnel also examined all other passengers.
The crane’s rescuers picked up the bus and released the bus driver, whose leg was stuck at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers are charged with sexual crimes before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has become known
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual crimes against children prior to charges in 2011 against child care workers in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the commission's opening statement stated that it “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
Chief Executive Director Philip Hayre was asked about one case where YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another when the instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Fernness, a lawyer who assisted the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in an introductory speech to the Commission, had also allowed inaccuracies, arguing that “there had been external verifications of YMCA, which had recognized that YMCA was at the forefront of child safety”.
The evidence commissions indicate that YMCA was notified that it received a second out of the four possible quality audit evaluations carried out by the Department of Education and the Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayre, who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had allowed failure by hiring the Lord and had failed to provide clear understanding by the staff of his obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years of his work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hearer rejected the assumption that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord's safety of children.
The officers testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, had personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them, and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Ocwell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked her to train her to protect the children, because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, the guardian of the children of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the leader of the Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to reach”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from staff members that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord led them away from the thought of having to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented to the Council of YMCA New South Wales his view that the lesson for organizing the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “missing information” by staff members, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the indictments was taken by the Director-General of YMCA for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the distortion of evidence, but that it was “insulted” and that the decision had been badly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization during its work in the period 2009-2011, and the Commission was informed by an expert on child-restoration by Professor Stephen Smallboun of the University of Griffith.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearings were adjourned until 20 December.
Fashion week in São Paulo.
She's considered not just a model, but a real star.
Even though Giselle Bundschen had left her job for a while, she had taken up maternity leave, during these days and during this week she had come to work separately.
The long-term absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's most highly paid supermodel.
This time she participated in the defile of Colchchi.
Fashion week's final is usually the most interesting show.
Like a stylist named Lino Villaventura.
The brand is over 30 years old, parallel to the production of the pre-aport of the class of lux, the modeler is active in theatre and cinema, producing performances and designing costumes for many well-known paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies involved in textiles and fashion world participated in the final week of fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic areas of production, it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches $50 billion.
Tony Blair said that he would take the chance of returning as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but he acknowledged that return was unlikely.
The 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided the discussions of British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
Replying to the question whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister Blair, according to London Evening Standard, he said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
The head coach, Milano Massimiliano Allegrey, regretted the negative outcome of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start were due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, but Tmw says Allegrey.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
The second Roman was added, but in general I cannot say that we lost our concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we met the challenge of joining the League of Champions.
We're running behind schedule now, but this is due to a series of injuries from key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who met at a high level.
The experts of the competition activities going to Cardiff to fight for the Bad Year award knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, taking his first steps, this little boy and his hettland pony, Toffy, slipped through three tours to easily take the lead prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — equal growth — received high marks for the appearance, conduct, and style of the annual competition, held by the Sannibenko horse sport center in the town of Radri near Cardiff.
Having come to the attention of men and women in fine hats, he lifted his cap and proudly carried it around a two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his inadequacy over the years.
Toffy was highly regarded for his appearance and character.
Fenton was donated to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been working with the Shetland pony every day.
Donna's 30-year-old mother said, "Fenton and Toffy are a wonderful duet."
They had many rivals, but the two left with a golden cup and a rosary.
It was just his second speech with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The vastly unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb-Wail in South Wales, follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The whole audience was defeated, and everyone was crying out for approval and toppling."
He ran through the sand all over the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chicks he cares about.
Judging from what he started, he will be participating in the Bad Year soon, and I am sure he will do well.
A representative of this annual horse show said, “Fenton only three years, but he knows how to treat his ponies”.
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show.
They appreciate the harmony of the pony’s performance and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffy, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped out his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
China newspaper's appeal “to be restructured”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued in the front row an appeal for the release of the accused in the reporter ' s libel, should be reorganized, the press regulator reported.
The New Express newspaper, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles on a company with a public share of property.
The New Express must now undergo “a process of complete correction of errors”, according to the regulator.
The decree on “correction of errors” came from the Guandun Office in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on the Zoomlion stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The management of the New Express has been disoriented,” said the regulator.
He reported that it had been decided “to impose administrative enforcement on Chen Junzhou in the form of withdrawing his report licence”.
He also “provided to Yangcheng Evening News Group a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of newspaper officials and immediately amend the New Express leadership”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities in the construction equipment of a company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two calls for his release in the first place, stating that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” said CCTV State Broadcaster.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen’s confession, New Express issued an apology in the front row, stating that the newspaper had not been able to properly verify his report.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from coercing anyone to self-response.
U.S. tunnel found — Mexico for drug trafficking, equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric relay systems, has been found.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel as four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose Zigzags are the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (US).
The area is filled with undetected warehouses, which facilitates the hidden load of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers were charged with keeping marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which gave drug cartels the challenge of rapid delivery of their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passageway of approximately 700 yards, equipped with track roads, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions have been increased in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increased in Belarus since November this year, and BELTA has been reported to the Directorate-General for Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
With effect from 1 November this year, an adjustment of the average salary of workers in the Republic applied in the previous recalculation of pensions will be made, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and a corresponding recalculation of labour pensions in accordance with Decree No.478 of 21 October 2013 on pension increases.
As a result of the recalculation of labour pensions by age from November, the average increase of 5.3 per cent is estimated.
The average pension at the age of B2 million would be 295,000.
The increase in pensions affects 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on increased pensions as of November will increase by EUR274.3 billion per month.
At the same time as the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and benefits to pensions will be recalculated due to an increase in the subsistence minimum per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 530 per cent higher than in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension allowances will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.
In Belarus, more than B53 trillion-0 were established in 2013 for pensions based on increases.
British police handing Assange a notice of extradition
The British police today submitted a notification of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who hid in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian "official demand to surrender" requiring him to appear at the police station, adding that if he failed to comply with this requirement, he would be further subject to arrest.
Assanju is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his ability under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer him to the United States, on 19 June he hid in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “provided to a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station day and time after our choice”, the Spokesman said.
It continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible allegations of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic dispatches on the WikiLeaks website against secrecy.
Driver speeding 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined for £1000
The car driver was fined £1000 for speeding up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink between his legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Howe from Tiptry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
The Kolchester Howie World Court has admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of a driver ' s license to seven penalty points resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Howie also pledged to pay the costs of £90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners will result in the London bubble breaking
The Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced a 7 per cent government tax rate in 2012 for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own houses in company rather than individuals.
To date, the household in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, accounting for £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already in excess of the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamburg combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase in the household to expensive homes and the introduction of associated anti-removal legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead to some foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate — the top 5-10 per cent of the housing market — in the rich south-west London belt extending from Fulham to Wimbledon has grown to a record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in the centre of London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6 per cent per annum, but were obscured by the actively developing “national market” with rising prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how dog’s tail movements are linked to its mood.
Early studies have shown that happy dogs pour their tail on the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tails.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigar, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain participate differently in the formation of inducers who cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that, like a human, dogs on the right side of the brain control the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the varied tailing of other dogs, researchers watched animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the rate of the animal’s heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes turn one way and sometimes to the other.
Professor Wallortigar said: “We showed dogs video — either naturalistic versions or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate tail movements and guide tails more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that nothing else was moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilting mostly to the left, their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Wallortigar said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experiences, which they need to worry about, and which dogs do not.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and their tails are often removed in one direction and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of their animal’s emotions.
The expert on dog behaviour, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to determine whether dogs were relevant to the left and right sides.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was directed to the left, rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed — contrary to the Italian study”.
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence in the various mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and the dog is not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior may be recorded, we will likely soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys are putting away a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed the Glasgow concert after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This bossfield group was supposed to be performing at the town's Hydro concert site on Friday.
However, a vocalist named Alex Turner had them move the show.
This statement was made after she was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: “After deciding to broadcast the show on Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after applying for Arctic Monkeys, they should also postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November and the Glasgow show at the Hydro site will take place on 21 November.
All tickets to this show remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket owners for any inconvenience that has caused them.
To obtain any additional assistance, please contact the ticket office where you obtained the tickets.
Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will take the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to sleep for the first time during his service on February 22, according to the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the cardinal of the 80-year-old age, he is no longer able to take part in the pope's election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 “Cardinal voters”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that all current cardinals, known as the constituency, would be gathered before the Sana'am ceremony.
“Dad Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consensus in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal voters is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to re-establish the number of electorate cardinals to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
The next year will be important because it will be the first since France was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if a new cardinal pope would appoint from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first cardinals selected since the formation of the French Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with seeking ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “very possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in that situation for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually appointed cardinal bishops from large incomes, but Francisco “polon surprises — so we do not know who he will call”.
GM calls off a number of new U.S. pickups to complete seat backs
General Motors Co reflects almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address problems with manual adjustment of seat back inclinations, according to a notification from US regulators in the field of vehicle safety on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may be defective in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not conform to the federal safety standards of the motor vehicle on head restraints.
“When the vehicle is hit from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Traffic Safety Notification website.
The models withdrawn were made from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM pick-up began in June and is the most important vehicle start-up for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickups of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider informing owners of the 16-day suspension of the Government ' s work, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model year, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37.47.
The cry of despair by the elector Obama
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to be undermined by commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the reformed Health System Obama website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second - grade medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that the book would impress me during my first year of high school and bring me a sense of hope.
It's called “Defense for Victory” and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my report on my patients and go to bed at night, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and the performances could take hold of the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programmes took a break to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At Obama's appointment in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, such as pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of Guantánamo base among others.
But after a number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and peers, I ended up with explanations that I can provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of the republicans cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or to strike drones against innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the Agency of National Security or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose the Government ' s misconduct.
It cannot explain the killing of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or failure to comply with State funding and expenditure limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusion of the report that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
And lately, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signature of the Law on Available Medical Care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership might run counter to the political campaigns that precede it?
Clearly, the work of an elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, in all of the examples I have mentioned above, they have been largely the choice of the administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was so enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and harsh alternative, he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes that we had heard of for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s ratings dropped below 45 per cent this week, returning to 2008 through this book became much more difficult.
It makes me feel sorry for many of the promises that flew away.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton caused Obama's deafening defeat at the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting to analyse the reasons for failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their purpose.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you perfectly.

Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of child-care leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest over child-care leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to move away from the issue of whether or not he had a conflict.
Palmer's Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to abolish taxes on carbon and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have been the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally be the winner of political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid child-care leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they receive leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine-Cost seat of the Fairfax constituency with 53 votes after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the voting procedure in order to expedite the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the election be decided two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system like this so that we can come in, input our data into the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 6:30 that same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using pencils in our day seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Costa and would be “very serious” for his new work.
State office involves the service of society.
“We do not seek any rewards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed two traders from its currency office, according to two persons familiar with the situation, which is another indication that the global control of alleged currency manipulations is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations involving the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff members to be removed during the opening investigation, which coincides with a scandal involving the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation continues, and we cooperate fully with FCA and our other regulators,” said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted the e-mails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the UK Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave at his current post as head of European spot exchange in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trades in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating alleged foreign exchange manipulations in several Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finland, the anti-monopoly body of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering claims that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said persons familiar with the situation.
Banks look at instant messages and e-mails over the years to find cases of offences.
The review news has been heard by traders in the field of activities, which has been one of the largest sources of income in recent years for the investment banks ' trade units, which, however, has been difficult this year because the low volatility of currencies has reduced the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and high-profile currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the Senior Trader, despite the huge volume of daily trades in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low cost”.
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he had dismissed one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's trademark health law was constitutional, a major victory for Obama's administration.
After voting 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate orders under the law on the protection of patients and accessible health care requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scully, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act that states improve the requirements of the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all the federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally forced.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed a request to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate, Mitt Romney.
Football's a reason for different things?
In the framework of the Open Court of Policy and experts in the Gossdam, they discussed how to maintain national peace in Russia.
One suggestion was to ban football in the North Caucasus because of the scandal and strife.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent developments in Birjulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society” policies and media should be corrected.
He must have been referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Jyrinski, who in one of the television shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with a barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and measures to harmonise relations among the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the discussion of somburism.
Maksim Grigoryev stated that the events in Birülev were “a model conflict that could be predicted”, but “we have too many people and institutions to answer” and seven children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practiced by Europe for migrants, is, in the opinion of the public, failing and must be pursued.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed high hopes on a new, unified history book.
“It is still necessary to establish a cultural guide for the peoples of the country, so that the students in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagesta, and vice versa”, he said.
Gennady Züganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for “invoices to Russia’s dismemberment”: “If in the United States to say on the radio that Alaska should be given, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Jirinovski tried hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing ill and acute national problems to public debate: “There is little to be said in the dust of controversy!”
The leader of the "One Russia" faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, was here to advise journalists to conclude a paper and agree to discuss the subject in a fair manner, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and the order in general has been stated by Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for the international peace in their territories.
But Ludmila Andricenko was not thrilled about the law: it had no “clear notions as to what the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits was.
Therefore, the actors would interpret the different scope of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the resources necessary to deal with such complex issues, there is no means, and the methodological recommendations they can use do not provide them with a centre...
The head of the Danish Nationality Committee, Gajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the establishment of a special agency called the Ministry of National Security, which deals with national policy issues.
But Valeri Tishkov, who headed a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, objected.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a portfolio-free minister, who could be approached if anything.
“We are going around the country, the shells are going around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to act together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support,” said the representative of the RPC on civil society relations of the Chaplain v.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, religious ones, including, in his view, should.
Oleg Nilov here led the discussion into the unexpected: "There is more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan to seek, but they are not pushed on the wrong path, not on the wrong path," he said.
"Not that way" is football development: "That's football player beating up the whole crowd, the flags burning, and the comrades stoning each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There's another kind of sport called regby...
"They will not be equal in the world in this form of sport!"
No one will play in the Regby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Jirinovski intervened.
You'll offer them a kerling!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's like the Georgian Zaporeznik to offer...
In Jaroslavla, there was a difference of savage behaviour on the stands from the Moscow Club during the game with the local club.
Football has to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Board of Control and Disciplinary Committee, Artur Grigoryantz, reported that Cuban was fined with 500,000 rubles, passing from the House of Football correspondent SE Philippa PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Red Cross Club have been applied for the fire of the Dagestan flag by the Tribunes during the 14th round home game against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
The illegal behaviour of Cuban spectators is fined for 500,000 roubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims filed by Nortel
A group of thousands of former Nortel patents filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the price of which it overturned at Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed patent infringement claims at the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key Internet search words with their advertising, according to the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones working on the Android operating system from Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has several times raised the proposed price, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the patent case of the Nortel Consortium Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this transaction the partial patent library of Motorola was the determining factor.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to obtain patents for auctions, Google has violated them and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit states.
Rockstar requires increased compensation for losses from Google because it claims that the violation of patent rights on the part of Google is intentional, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes the oath
Muhammad Mursey takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he made an oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Murcy during a solemn ceremony on direct television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability”, said Murcy, a 60-year-old American engineer with an American education from Bratyev Muslim, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years had been a banned organization that served as a target for the hard-on of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursey arrived with a small courtship shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the Presidential pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on a commonly revived road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
While Mursey was ridiculed as a non-charismal spare wheel, his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself not only as Islamists but also as all those who wish to bring the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Murcy, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in a packed wooden panel of the hall where he took an oath.
Mursey later went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the national anthem, during which he stood “peacefully”.
Military officer Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Armia and the People — One Hand”, which was chanted by hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became a foothold of Islamic student groups.
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that culminated in Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born, and promised to regain the power of the President, who was deprived of his office by the military council, who took the case from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath before the court, not before Parliament, as it is accepted, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursey’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tuméni Engineers Association was held at the Yalutorov Motor Plant.
A new steel line was presented as part of the event.
According to Business Director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on steel construction market in the Tumen area was conducted in 2011 with the creation of a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electricity pipelines per month.
It was then decided to change the profile of the plant and its installation of production equipment.
Already more than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped this year.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles, said Denise Gribanov.
A new condition was launched in October, allowing for an increase in the range.
The factory produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the heat industry, small forms of construction and the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach 50,000 tons of production per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumene region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased, currently 157, and in plans for the purchase of new equipment, an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is retraining and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new long-term sharping unit of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of products as well as another condition, with the rate of pipe production up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is planning to produce pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise is tasked with closing up up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen area in these products.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, referring to production managers, advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of machinery plants.
This also includes forms of State support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on credits for new equipment and its lease costs.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated and two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The latter commission, which will review subsidy treaties, will accept documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of local producers ' participation in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provides for 150 million roubles that can be used to compensate for leasing payments and credits for new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million to energy saving programmes.
Up to 72 million roubles are being reduced to reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment in the southern Tumen area for the oil-gas complex.
According to Leonidad Ostroumov, this form of support would end in the long run, as the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax paid by oil companies in the regional budget.
They are not doing so at present, and subsidies are becoming the region ' s direct expenditures.
The Government therefore considers the area as a priority the direct support of industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil sector through them.
Budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation with regard to oil.
The grant for their equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern Tumenian industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the average Russian band, where the cheaper labour force.
In addition, there is no question of the continuity of the new owner of TNC-VR, Rosneftt, who has not yet placed his orders in the tobacco companies.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvatska Project expires in 2013, and no extension requests have been received.
Currently, southern enterprises that specialize in oil-gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
It remains open to the question whether taxes will be received from the oil mined in the region or will be paid at the location of the new owner of the area.
Tomic will work 240 hours for extremist role-playing in social media
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work by a city dweller, who placed an extremist video on the social network, RIA Novosti reported to a representative of the district court press on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his website on a popular social network that was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case has been brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code, “Actions to incite hatred and hatred and to humiliate the dignity of a person committed publicly”.
“The Lenin District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of mandatory work”, said the Agency ' s interlocutor.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in prices of goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country's prices will decrease considerably once the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He spoke to his readers about it on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that the prices would have to go down.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.
However, there should be no price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which have recently appeared enough in our country, that association with the EU is a price increase, is not the case, or, more accurately, is not the case," Azarov summed up.
Investigators review information on child abuse in Bijsk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten teacher in the town of Biska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are now ascertaining all the circumstances, as well as the legal evaluation of the actions of the staff of the kindergarten.
After the charge of stupidity, Evgenia Vasileva spoke.
Eugenia Vasiliev, whose focus has been on the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous press publications about both the thefts in the Ministry and its personal relationship with the ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry, and her passion for valuable things.
On 1 November, however, the figure of the Defence Services case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, she said, "It was, of course, one task: to extract any negative information from me concerning the former Minister of Defence."
I was blackmailed into testifying, or I'll be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100 percent confident of victory.
In doing so, it can be concluded from the interview that Vasiliev was perhaps most likely given the impression that he was not interested in her taste.
Perhaps there is a statement by the official representative of the SC, Vladimir Markin, that counterfeits were found in the collection of paintings collected by the figures of the Defence Services case.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artificial expertise appointed by the investigators following the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
After all, they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss any personal points?
I think it's a mess," says Vasiliev.
On the question of whether she recognized her guilt at least in one of the 12 criminal episodes she was charged with, Vasiliev stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC, that Vasilieva avoids examining the criminal case, the author's lawyer stated that he and his client “an investigator does not allow himself or his client to know the facts of the case”.
What was the reason for the revelation of Vasiliev under house arrest, who had not yet been associated with the press?
Maybe how could a woman not be able to answer a bad-tasting charge?
Or the rights of the Komsomolki journalists who claimed a few days ago that she had “falled into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of reports of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serduk with her wife and his return to the family?
In his article “Serdukov’s return to his wife”, famous military observer “KP” Victor Baranetz wrote: “Followers do not rule out that after this shock it may become more talkative during interrogations.”
Earlier, Vasiliev had been charged with some of the allegations of the illegal sale of mine defence property.
It's a winter party.
What needs to be done in the garden before freezing starts
In the autumn of autumn, it is best to select honey-containing preparations, such as the 1%board mixture or Abiga-Pik, Oxyham, Ordan, etc.
You think the tourists have gone to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its income forecast for the full year and is awaiting a record income from those who are resting in Australia and Britain.
This tourism firm now expects that its main total annual income before tax will range from $325 million to $340 million, compared with the previous forecast from $305 million to $315 million.
If the current guidelines are reached, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre received 8 per cent in the first half of the year and started the second half with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and Britain.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits from our 10 countries, and some of them expect a record high profit in the full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offset by a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, the British business Flight Centre in leisure was doing well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Her business in the United States has compensated for the losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half year and is expected to receive a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the Flight Centre shares grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, barnaul police discovered two gaming rooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial Area on Summer Street.
At the time of the inspection in the establishment there was a game.
There were 24 machine guns in the clubs.
Another game club was found in Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
Russia's Barnaul MMF reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the heading “Illicit Organizations and Gambling”.
Tech's out.
The evidence will soon be sent to the industrial and Lenin district courts.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has mistreated two sisters.
After the bodies were killed, they were burned.
As reported to the New Region in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Sverdlovsk Region, two women with signs of violent death were discovered in the day before the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralska Street.
The victims were soon identified.
They were found to be sisters, one of whom was a resident of Ekaterinburg for 44 years, and the other was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg Region.
The burning apartment they rented a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are involved in various homicides, checking the alibis of formerly convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is determined that women had rented the apartment and where they had lived before they had worked with whom they had relations.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also include “out-of-programme texts” in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, pupils will be required to pass a separate language examination, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is scheduled to launch new English and Mathematics training programmes tomorrow, the first subject subject subject to radical review.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
A separate governing body in the field of the OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure of the secondary school exams, with a new evaluation system and a smaller volume of courses.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “a broad consensus had been reached that we should reform our examination system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and strict”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week per quarter) than in most countries.
To compare, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year, while Singapore has pupils of some 138 hours.
Although there will be no more formal requirement for more time in the math schedule, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math exams, combined with an increased rate in the rating table, would likely provide incentives for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
Training will focus more on “real-life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Hayha Tickets will be available for tourists in 2,200 roubles
From Blagovestensk to Hayheh, tomorrow tourists will begin to fly ships on an airbag.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra expenses.
A ticket to the puma is traditionally much more expensive than a warm-up trip.
According to AmuraSSO's reference service, the cost of a regular ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
Passing through the comfort room will cost 2,800 roubles.
In other words, during this season the tickets did not travel: at the same price the cougar was driven by tourists and last spring, and a year ago by autumn.
Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rate is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth of its GDP to be insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, Reuters reported.
We planned GDP growth this year in the area of 3%, perhaps a little more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it would seem not too bad, but for us it is not, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, for it to develop, it has to be faster.
It is now very important that Russian companies, the Russian business, receive normal loans at a normal price, is the first thing that must be done," said the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, doctors are not as many — just one in 5,000
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN characters in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to make him a CNN Year Hero.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and again fell unconscious wandering around hospitals that were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and triggered a hematoma that reminded him of herself for the rest of her life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said George Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, he accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could obtain.
“It’s not easy,” said Bvelle.
- You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bvelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413.
And even if Cameroonians could contact a doctor, many of them wouldn't be wearing a pocket.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditure is private.
“The only problem is poverty,” Bvelle said.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his fellow countrymen, Bvelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team have assisted nearly 32,000 volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are loaded into the vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and headed across the country to visit the needy village.
They don't always have luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are seen as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed the occasion for the holiday, and Bvelle is more than happy to join in his broad smile and boundless energy.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bvelle said.
They come from all over the district within 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of medical services on weekends.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive the bones, the glasses, or free birth certificates — documents that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At night, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, municipality or house building; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to clear the room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operation and sanitation of the equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work until the early morning of Sunday.
This is a slow pace, but the focus of the brigade is usually helping to support village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and to work,” Bvelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those to whom they help.
One person explained that his free rodent treatment operation would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these weekend and hospital admissions, Bvelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job that he said accounts for 60% of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bvelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money to organize these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bvelle in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” said O'Malley.
As a second-grader student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training were paid for by Bvelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bvelle, almost constant workload is not a severe test.
To help others live a happy life, to live up to his father’s promise is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bvelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.

Snowden agreed to testify to Merkel's audition.
He met with Edward Snowden, Moscow.
During the discussion, it was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the General Prosecutor of the FWG in the case of a possible wiretap by the German Chancellor of Special Forces of the United States.
Snowden was willing to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,” said Hans Christian Strebel, “that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all conditions of arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are starting to respond to a scandal surrounding US spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
To this end, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Makey, told reporters at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahem Davutoglu, reports BELT correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish counterparts and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administration of the two countries will provide wide-ranging assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves," said Vladimir Makey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that Ankara had held the next 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission, following which a protocol had been signed.
The Parties have drawn up a road map of the Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy and the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
“The protocol of the past meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the present protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other to be reliable partners”, he said.
In turn, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the two country heads of foreign policy had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and various projects in the negotiations.
The trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the view of the Minister, needs to be increased and brought to a $1 billion rate.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he considers.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama went on a sweaty day about his repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans have criticised the President in recent days for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some adjustments to his initial public promise.
“The majority of people with working medical insurance can keep it,” he said in his speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called the “new recovery” for the termination of services, Obama called on the Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who purchase the insurance may be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the Law on Available Medical Care.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better,” said Sibelius in a speech to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said that the launch of the internet sales site has been “incredulously bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry, just like everyone else,” she said.
“I really want your trust back.”
The angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which was captured by the microphone behind it at yesterday's chamber hearings after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the law on affordable medical care had not voluntarily renounced the government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rossbalt Agency has denied media status for non-censorship.
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to grant an invalid license for the registration of Rossbalt, which reads "Lenta".
Roscomnadzor insisted that the media status of the Agency be deprived of its status because of systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was established during the trial: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing the publication of the right to make counter-measures.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Rossbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the years that followed, the agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Robbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been listed as the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
In doing so, Rossbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive agency publications has been (and so far are) notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to having an extensive base of sources in various departments, Rosbalt also argued in favour of such assumptions that Natalie Chaplin's wife, Victor Cherkesov, was in charge of the project.
The role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear until the end: it is often referred to as the project manager.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonin, chief editor of Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rossbalt did not appear in the federal media ratings, either by quoteability or by audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the rating of the attendance of Russian media on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), a month of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the observations of the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the King and Shoot Group, the defeats in the capital Birülev.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law had entered into force, banning journalists from a censored defence.
The Department found prohibited language in two of the video role-playing agencies (Jigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot defiled oil towers).
Further sides describe differently.
On the basis of the videos found, Rosbalt accused the media law of gross and systematic violation of the media law and sought the Agency's license.
In Robbalte, the Department ' s claims were wrong: firstly, the rolls were not drafting material; secondly, the mother ' s words were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the roll had been warned, they were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency appealed against Roscomnadzor's claims before the world court - and when Mosgorsud accepted the Roscomnadzor's claim on 22 October 2013, the complaint was still pending.
However, as many as 25 judges of the world have decided not in favour of Robbalta: Nikolai Ulyanov, the editor-in-chief, was found guilty of violations of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles, 10,000 per roll.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Mosgorsud hearing - if you gave up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Robbalta ' s registration certificate, depriving the media agency of its status.
You can't say that Robbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by the members of the State (declaration to the head of Rocomnadzor Alexander Jarov on 10 October signed 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of CRC).
Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Universal Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Journalists' Union, Pavel Gusev, and Head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the publication was illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor's leadership has even provided him with some assurance that the case will not come before the license is withdrawn.
The court over “Rosbalt” showed that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is safer today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacities and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of the disarmament of Damascus has been completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of combat poisons for use by the BBC.
The destruction of the toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to a representative of OPCW, toxic substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack in Damascus on 21 August.
The primary task of inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure to mix chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be carefully monitored to prevent them from resting.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly examined by Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new inspection facilities if they were to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
United States dollars believe that this fire was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached under Russian mediation, destroy or put into service all the capacity for the production and filling of shells, poisoning gases and liquids.
Now that this phase has taken place, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian army ' s already existing chemical weapons.
It is expected that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve paralytic toxic substances, each nanarized mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a schedule of action for two weeks to begin.
OPCW field operations manager Jerry Smith stated to the Bi-bi-si that his inspectors “beheld the destruction of equipment personally”.
“They are now unable to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement states that 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria have been visited by inspectors and has convinced them that shell and poison plants have either been destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two sites were too dangerous to conduct an inspection, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the manufacture of chemical weapons was “particularly difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, the time to celebrate with the inspectors had not yet been found was too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that U.S. espionage “has gone unwelcomely far”
John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the protection tactics of US tracking programmes by making unprecedented recognition that, in some cases, U.S. espionage “has gone unbecomingly far”.
The secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on the autopilot during Edward Snowden's loud exposure to the NSA's spy activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken on some of the things going on on the autopilot, because this possibility already existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, on 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. Government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: "Sometimes this has gone awry.
And the President is determined to shed light on the issue and explain himself to the people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good reason and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We work in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, explode people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the collapse of planes, the explosions of buildings and the killings of people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, the Chairman of the European Senate subcommittee said on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had interviewed members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment of the Agency's national security surveillance.
"For the interests of US national security, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who served as chairman of the European Senate's subcommittee of international relations, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, defended spy action against allies as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other legislators involved should be sounded in the coming days.
He said the travel programme was still under development.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “excessiveness from better motives” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had used for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” said Murphy.
Mr. Kerry, meanwhile, had to go to this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the United States' strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
The influence of prison officials will increase in the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of the Social Monitoring Commissions (UNCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the silhouette lobbyists will increase their influence.
NCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonidad Razzjaev, the anxiety in the copy colony -- it is through the ONC that most of the resonance incidents behind the grid are being announced.
The ONC is controlled by fighting between human rights defenders and rapist lobbyists.
At the OOP working group meeting on the formation of ONCs, I suggested that the selection of experience in human rights activities should be measured.
“He was not accepted and listed without criteria”, says Valery Borschev.
Borshev is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the universal structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
As a member of the State of Apple, he has drafted a law regulating the activities of ONCs.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the composition of the NNCs in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants claim to be vacant in 1800 places, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria, competitions were not able to be held due to the absence of candidates.
The DOJ pledges to organize the dowry in vacant seats.
Moscow ' s ONC is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition.
According to Borshev, in the current capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 rapists, while in the election option in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
However, the new composition may be re-entered by the representative of the Battle Brotherhood, Vjeceslav Kalinin.
He had been a member of the NEC for three years, but had never visited prisoners.
Borshev believes that the Force, by appointing its Chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the Force is coordinated by the member of the ONC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the Russian "Officers" - an organization that defends the interests of the forces.
"I don't have babies on tape," said RBK daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied that he lobbied the promotion of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkova, he didn't even care what list they're voting for in the DOJ.
It is considered a form of pressure to make the Borjev information public.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the management of the Barracks NEC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's copiers.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ROK Rostova-na-Donu that can move from human rights defenders to rapists.
One of the new lists of missing human rights defenders from the local commission, however, turned out to be one of its opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Rising Commissions of Borschev consider them to be "a place for Kopesk".
Hope Toloconnikov's revelations did not affect Mordovia's ONC, which is considered “strong”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new composition, and she didn't even accept the documents for the competition.
OP member Nikolai Svanidze told RBK daily that he voted against the proposed list because he resented the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to the other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev said he voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the compilation of lists of ONCs by Deputy Secretary Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the RBC daily that he did not see fit to divide the candidates for human rights defenders and rapists, and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The mushroom is not expected to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal for conviction and was released on bail.
Stevie Roschel Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket provincial court on 15 June of filing a false complaint following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver attacked on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men detained her.
However, the video surveillance cameras later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking relationships with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, she was kept in the local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-hour prison term at the prison centre of the Phuketa district general regime, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who has applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” with the well-being of its daughter and was awaiting her return to Australia.
"It was obviously a worrying time, but we hope that it will return home safely as soon as possible," Tanx said.
Bamford filed an appeal against her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 bats.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently vacationing in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence by two years and force her to serve a term in adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its ruined tourist image, which will result in a justifiable sentence.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris presenting his novel Eltisheva, translated into French.
Remember, it was this novel that became the finalist of four prizes: the Clear Pole, the Russian Booker, the National Bestseller and the Big Book.
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prizes of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old proselytes.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day life story and storytelling has been a source of heated controversy among critics of a wide variety of directions.
It can be argued that the articles on prose and publicist of Shadow, reviews of its books and journals create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
Discussions on the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to criticism by Sergei Chuprinin, are mostly based on the fact that its participants understand the word “literature” as the present and future sees not only our vocabulary but also our life.
