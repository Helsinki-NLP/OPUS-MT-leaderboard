Members of the Vale Assembly are concerned that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the assembly are appalled at the proposal to name each other as the new MP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.).
This was due to plans for the name of the Assembly to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum of members of the congregation is concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that in their group they were concerned, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in valescan twp means silly and pwp poop.
A member of the group from Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Valizan conservative said that his group of 'open spirit' was about a change of name, but he warned that there was a small difference between the words of the MWP and Muppet in the pronunciation.
In this context, the expression “w” is similar to that of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to present changes to the name, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by members themselves.”
By the law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valizan Assembly was empowered to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals and received wide support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valižan Parliament.
The Commission selected the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP” as members of the assembly, but the most supported was the option of “MWP”.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President-in-Office of Elin Jones, who is required to present draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibilities of the functioning of the members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
They wish to resolve for decades the long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent for changing his name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price they must pay for EU and NATO accession.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church were silenced as the Harlem churches face problems
“The older people I talked to say that they used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is not one or the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People today have different associations.
The bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbors, where people regularly go.”
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and will soon be back to the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced with joint administration buildings (condominium) where people who would not help the shelters in the neighborhood would still live.
“The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will come quickly when all these churches will close, as it is unlikely that the people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The construction was taken over by the Black Religious Community, which performed services nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the Black Religious Community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support the dark.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, the bells were ordered to knock.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called bells “bells for poor people”.
The expert, who landed in July, named them a little differently: “cultural treasure” and “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells for knocking on which he played the dark-polt musician, Dionysio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was knocking on bigger bells.
Mr Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s church.
In the last few months, the Church of St. Martin’s has had a complicated story with architects and contractors; some have brought in church laikas and others bishops.
Krystija – the administrative body of the parish, composed of laymen – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would "try to transfer the costs" to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about transparency by the bishops.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he was diving with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he sailed with the group to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster and then found out that he was screaming “He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that his whole keyhole was torn apart.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
In a statement to the media, the water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper hull.
Responsible for 48 hours prevented access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami beach’s in Ecinitas due to investigation and security.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s coming to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners such as they have in the department store, and with professional staff.
As part of its entry into the British beauty market, worth GBP 2.8 billion and still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores around the country and in several stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more room in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also revives its boutique offer of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products are something younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop’s perfume store will try the concession in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Online shopping and daily shopping of small quantities of food in local shops require more efforts by supermarkets to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to wholesalers, as the supermarket chain is trying to combat discounts from Aldi and Lidl with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group opened the Argos outlets in several hundred stores and also the Habitat trade since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and tookovers were more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s took part in a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sales of GBP 125 million three years ago to Célesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, by a pharmaceutical company with 281 stores.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as they were supposed to expand the offer of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which presents a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "angry" because Holly Willoughby stepped out of business worth £11 million
The star broadcasts Dragons Dan (Good Business) rages because the television director Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from work worth £11 million, with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and accessories, Truly.
The business pair was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The host of this Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby became furious with the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones because at the last minute, she withdrew from their profitable lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a gold girl TV on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of her new business, worth up to £1.5 million, she no longer had time to devote herself to their brand of clothes and accessories, Truly.
The company was compared with the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted to double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly's brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future to spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely surprised everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlowe there is a warehouse full of goods prepared for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would cost the company several million due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been a good friend for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp's in 2016 and joined them in March as president.
Couples took vacations together, and Jones also has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I’m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about media criticisms due to comments that some seemed to be “non-president” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
Trump, with his mocking “newist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, and his first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step against North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “appropriate response” of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues with sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his address.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results — they stopped the missile testing, helped free the hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded full scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of us.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants were displaced, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear not to require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated," said Sumbunov.
Save the Children's Organization is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
On the Saturday, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paluj and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters were built after the tsunami in Aceh, this is not common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren in Paluj probably contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, sails towards Paluj, but it will take at least three days for it to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Vidodo put the improved destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Yok administration to re-elect next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from prolonged tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored a late tie against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge, with a score of 89 minutes, saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted the pass of Xherdan Shaqiri 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal at the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote gate.
The arrow traveled high above the criminal premises to the right upper corner of the door.
At the end, the ball went through Capa Arrisabalage and fell into the goal.
“I simply tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always drag it on as far as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as I can,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I didn’t think much anymore and simply decided to shoot.”
At halftime, Chelsea led 1-0 with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Attacker scored the ball back to Mateo Kovacic and ran into Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he put it nicely through the defense, and Hazard ran into the prison space.
Hazard got ahead of the defense, and with his left leg, he shot at a remote gate through Liverpool's doorman, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli in the group section of the League of Champions at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea is in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday, waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe.
The number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, according to the State Agency for Accidents reported Sunday morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that there were a number of people due to Friday's 7.5 earthquake, which triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
The Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, has been demolished with the ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7.55 in a Grayson Mews building on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder.
The police are calling everyone who's been in the area, and they've seen or heard anything, to make a statement.
Detective Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial phase, but I invite everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to come into contact with us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on video with the camera car to get in touch with us, because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police officer confirmed that the woman was resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are keeping women's relatives informed.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one should enter or exit the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take several hours before they could reenter.
The police heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
There were two police vans inside the cordon at 2:00 p.m., and another one just outside.
A number of police officers were standing inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone with any information shall request to write at @MerPolCC to contact Crimestoppers 101 or anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of the "re-writing of history" dispute.
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatic supporters of Puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society referred to Crick’s proposal as “stupidness” and “the attempt to re-write history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Westminster Palace will become a target."
Iconoclasm in the English Civil War Cromwell did not even order or execute.
Perhaps Cromwell will be the wrong victim for the actions of his forefather in the last century.
The great presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell shows the 19th century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) see as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate performance is the subject of constant historical debates.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from when the Lord was a protector also deserve celebration and remembrance.”
Chinese farmer's murderous pig mutilated to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
A man who was identified only by the name “Yuan” was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near a pig at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, was reported Sunday in South China Morning Post.
Pig’s barking is being prepared for vaccination at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She is scheduled to travel with her cousin from Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of a neighbor pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody sponge in it.
Forensics confirmed that a 250-pound pig mutilated a farmer to death.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” a cousin named Wu was quoted in the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4.40 to feed the pigs.
They found his body about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The manager of the market told the Evening News that the pigs had been shut down so he wouldn't attack anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then the woman drove the animal away.
After the pigs had eaten the farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs were usually not offensive, but the taste of blood could be “prosperitor”.
“We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to be shown enough respect," he said.
To the southwest of the United States because of the remains of Hurricane Rosa comes heavy rain
It is predicted that Hurricane Rosa is moving toward the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is weak.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is a 1st category wind speed of 137 km/h from 5 a.m. in the eastern hours of the morning and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-air pressure zone is being strengthened over the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the western coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Bay California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture northwards in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure area, will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, deposition of floods and the possibility of earth’s beaches in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of precipitation in some cities will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
The strong rain canyons can turn into the river’s children, and the storms will bring the local suns of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rain to the parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that precipitation is more than 12 mm, which may result in reduced deposition of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropics will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, late on Monday and Tuesday, the precipitation will spread.
The strong rain will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
Great temperatures can occur in the United States in October, as the Arctic cools down and the tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at short intervals.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 degrees difference.
During the next few days summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most Central and Eastern United States will enter warm October at temperatures of about 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the parts of the north-east.
We could have 27 °C in New York on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on six television networks saw the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who was accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political path continued as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's turnover in the last minute: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-day investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was pinning her and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his gruesome testimony that he was 100% convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday, more than 20,4 million people are witnessing.
The company considered the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For easier performances, ratings are similar to those of the final football game or the award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is leading in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
The interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras recorded how the protestors shouted at him when he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During construction, he suspended the view for a few minutes, which was captured live by CNN TV cameras.
"I am standing here in front of you," a woman told him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have the power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he would speak more at the committee hearing, and then the door was closed.
All television networks also broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of Democrats called.
In part, Flake was persuaded to talk to a friend, a democratic senator, Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was decisive as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have a vote to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation into the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) of Kavanaugh charges.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "playing political games" at brexit
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May in the Sunday Times, the criticism of her plans to step out of the European Union was accused of playing political games with the British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers brexit plan and said that the proposal was that Britain and the EU pay the duties of another “fully absurd”.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, a suspect in the death of LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
According to a report by the Baron Rouge police, Dytheon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder charges.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Security amounts to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
An East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking a special unit to assist in the investigation leading up to the arrest for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the South University Police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team said that the team was "shaken" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
“That’s what you’ve been worried about all the time,” said Wade.
The volcano vomits ashes on Ciudad de Mexico
The ash that the volcano Popocatepetl vomits reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater increased and they recorded 183 gas and ash discharges within 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquakes.
The images on social networks showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshield of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police confronting Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protestors in support of independence were confronted by counter-narcotic police units and several thousand people joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised vote on secession.
A group of masked Separatism supporters, held by anti-external police units, have been littering them with eggs and metal with powder paint, which has created dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were fights, and the police had to use their badges to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who cried for several hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, faced protestors who supported unity and shouted “Let Spain live!”
According to local media reports, 14 people in protests received easier injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was referred to as illegal in Madrid, the Catalan separatists celebrated it, the tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the participation was low, as secession opponents boycotted the elections to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the region.
Groups supporting independence camped in front of voters overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of becoming independent.
»Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite important, although close wins at the regional elections of previous December, the Catalonian parties that support independence have had a difficult time maintaining the initiative this year, as many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or in custody are awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politics on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who had been in custody since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Condicting in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men running into the house with a car
Three men, 33 years old, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a Londonderry house.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 a.m. in summertime.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said the doors and the building themselves were damaged.
At some point, we're supposed to be shooting at the car with a crossbow.
Mengai hit Livingston with 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingstone guaranteed victory
He was the first to win the championship.
Dolly Menga's shot took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team was tied to the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team was thus left without victory in the guests of this year's championship, and the next week the Hearts, who lead on the scale, are behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna European League team on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his division's undefeated record at six games, and chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston has wasted his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have run pretty much before the hit, because with their directness, Rangers were causing a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made the breakthrough, but he sent the ball across the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit the front door, and Craig Halkett fired his head over the goal.
The guests left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for the guests when the interruptions occurred.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and scored from the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but the local defenses couldn't break through, and Gater Liam Kelly didn't have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Allan McGregor's goalkeeper shot Scott Pittman with his leg, and Lithgow fired from another Livingstone break in the attack past the goal.
The motions continued to come to Livingstone's penal space, but the natives refused all the attacks, two misdemeanors – Halkett's misdemeanor over Glenn Middleton's replacement and the crime of hand-to-hand play — and the judge did not judge.
"Excellent performance" Livingstone – analysis
Alasair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great show and score for Livingstone.
All of them were brilliant and continue to exceed expectations on this path up.
The game style and the law haven't changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be credited for the way he awakened the team from his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett had an extremely important role to play, and he was well placed on an excellent organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ready all the time.
The Rangers were simply short of inspiration.
Even though they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they are greatly lacking in these standards.
There were no bullets at the goal — only once they successfully beat the host defense — and this is some wake for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO's allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
Police prevented crowds from gathering before the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
It also expressed its opinion by hundreds of protestors — many of whom are Kurds— who do not support Erdogan's government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Controversial protests reflect the separation of the visitor some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as an autocrat.
A road accident in Deptford: A cyclist fatally crashed in a car crash
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a car crash.
There was an accident near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford southeastern town around 10.15 a.m. in summertime.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after the rider died in a collision in which the driver fled, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of a man so that they can notify their relatives.
They put up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 guards injured in the incident
Six prison guards were injured in an accident in a strictly protected man's prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9:30 a.m. in summertime and is still taking place.
They called on police specialists from the Tornado unit to take care of an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries on the face on the spot.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called upon specially qualified staff to provide for the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six personnel suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police responsible will be taken away and may be further behind bars as a result.”
There are over 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of crimes in the country.
In June, the warden was reported to have been in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-exempt police unit was called into custody to intervene in a major incident in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves the way through the southwest of the desert and poses a danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get mad at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be coming in late on Monday with the rain.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix stated that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) vehemently vehemently 60 kilometres from the Arizona border.«
The latest models of the national centre for hurricanes provide for 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual precipitation up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, between 25 and 50 mm of precipitation is expected, and individual precipitation is possible up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, for the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of rainfall is likely to be useful, as in the southwest it is currently a dry season.
“According to the US drought tracking centre, good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will reach with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and thus pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with 250 mm of precipitation,” was reported on the weather.com website.
Orcan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is abundant rain in the middle of the Baja Caliphonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the US Southwest Desert,” said the National Orcan Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and floods in the deserts and earth’s reptiles in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested for suspected attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the area of Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reported police from Avon and Somerset.
The police are calling on anyone who might have caught an event to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the hostility and anger of the democratic party"
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthlessness and unheard tactics of the democratic party,” Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered the unkindness and anger of the democratic party" in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention on Thursday, with clear and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault decades ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the day “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage”.
“The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an extraordinary record of public service,” said a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of voting Republicans in the mid-term elections.
»Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am really working with the candidacy," he said.
“That is why I fight for excellent candidates everywhere.”
Trump claims that the Democrats are on a mission of “resurrection and obstruction”.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment was scheduled to take place on Friday at the latest, the CNN was told by the consultant of the Republican party.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims increased
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia, and a number were driven by giant waves that rolled off the coast.
On Friday, several hundred people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the six - foot [6 m] waves hit the coast and carried many to their death and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they became victims”, said the representative of the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, everything down,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Paluj.
The photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a water-encircled bridge.
The earthquake sun continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “large” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area near the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugro said, the communications are completely terminated and there is no information from the Donggala area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are going to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pal, but officials say that the waves came just at the time of issuing the warning.
On the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men on the upper floor are shouting warning people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall slammed off the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
With Reuters, they couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power failure that interrupted communications around Paluj, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Paluj on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Sebevi, members of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in Palo, where the workers in the courtyard set up a shelter from the tarpaulins, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desolation.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with many experience were not allowed to come to Pal.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and staff assistance shall be permitted only if the crash site is declared a national accident zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still considered an accident at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international assistance, but there is not yet such a status.”
On the other night, after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hold back hope that their neighbors are miracles in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics liberated a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian team of sailing descent, was training two missing sailboats for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others, captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, were, according to Mr Mandagi, his students.
“Like an old man in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon remembers how within hours when news of the break-up of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulating around a community of sailing parachutes, he was desperate to send messages to whatsapp competitors in Paluj who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey key, instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police report, the thieves stole $26,750 from the security guard Brink’s, who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Leeve centre on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing for the delivery of the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a public statement.
While employed, another man “approached Brink’s security service from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All those with information on the identities of the suspects should call the NYPD at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was sent on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “A creature with the official name Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes just before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he was supposed to present his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who gave up the performance for “personal reasons”, said the broadcaster.
The word is a shortening of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think that the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning ‘you’,” was said by West at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you and I am all me.
Kanye, which means “the only” I have turned into Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; thoughtlessly or without him and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the army against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Oberdor swore he would never use military force against civilians as the state approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelco Plaza market that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements began to work in Latin America, at peaceful demonstrations in the market on October 2, 1968, 300 soldiers began to shoot and kill 300 people.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal associations.
U.S.A. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the resources it spends on research in this area, says the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are quite large for the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the chairman of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player in the Othello game, and later became executive director at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee said that he was familiar with previous American government technology competitions, such as the DARPA competition and asked when the next one would be easier to find the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must work hard to obtain state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” explained Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed the best universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to step up its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of a new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, to distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the creation of a narrow committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of USD 2 billion.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence
In the meantime, the American legislation that wanted to create the National Safety Commission for artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted Sunday at the referendum to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This would resolve a long dispute with Greece for decades, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, governments reached an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 per cent, as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum note was: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by agreeing with Greece?"
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for the young in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has announced that no irregularities have been reported by 13 hours.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an elector of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško gave their votes in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, for a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country to open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring a much-needed investment in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after handing out his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive result of “the confirmation of our future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that a referendum would be attended by between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian television, Telma, showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy to take over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City overplayed Brighton's entire defense and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday, winning Manchester City 2-0.
Aguerre's 65-minute hit looked ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentine Attacker accepted the pitch in the middle of the field.
He ran among three Brighton defense actors and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defense player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he handed Sterling over to his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the criminal space, returned the ball to Aguerre, who beat Brighton’s goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is dealing with problems in his legs," Coach City Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored goal at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who granted the Blue Blues an initial advantage in the fight of the First English League.
He scored goal in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton's half.
The ball on the left gave Leroy Sané a nice hand.
Sanne touched the ball several times and then sent Sterling's ball to the remote gate.
The blue blue attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
On Tuesday at 12.55 on the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, in the group part of the League of Champions meets Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and ruin their chances of the title
The Nationals team is out of control, so there's no particular reason for another attack.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes that he can climb the metal hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals, because in the West League they have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
On Friday, the Rockies won 5:2 over the Nationals team, providing at least an invitation to the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
“If we can't get anything, at least we can play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver, and the opposite team will play at the most likely level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
Nationals hasn't released the name of the first gunman for Sunday, but he'll probably be throwing Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal ever to be made 34 times, was thrown as a trigger player on Thursday, and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-winger won 18 victories this season and 7 losses with an average of 2,53 and 300 discharges by hitting 220,2/3 of the season.
Trump at Western Virginia Assembly
The President indirectly touched on his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican election participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the greatest – I am really working with the candidacy, so I am fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They're determined to take power again, using every means possible, you can see the shame, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of “resurrection and obstruction”.
“And you could see this in the last four days,” he said and called the Democrats “angry, evil, low-level and lying”.
He named the members of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and heard loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. It was a really bad body speech, the worst thing I've ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinions, she is impatient.
When a momentum activist in my local client gave me an untrustworthy statement, it wasn't even a surprise.
After all, I am the last in the ranks of members of the Labour Party Parliament, who are not welcome to express my opinion.
My fellow Members of Parliament, Joan Ryan, had a similar experience because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, there was a motion of no confidence in my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In the eight years that I am a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly the same.
Unfortunately, most meetings today do not use such a tone, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly obvious that different views in the Labour Party are not admissible and, in each opinion, it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the management of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues, whom I had previously thought we were sharing similar political views, expected me to change my opinion and take positions that I would never agree with – that this should be in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and in fact it doesn't matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks calling for a choice, condemning the policy of the middle and telling me that I shouldn't be in a labor party.
And it's not just my experience.
As a matter of fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face daily floods of sexist or racist insults, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the levels of abuse have become something quite common.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn explained that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to differing opinions, and with each proposal of confidentiality or change in the rules for selecting a client, it is becoming more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to put my head away and not to be so loud, and I will be “all right”.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which led the classroom to literally collapse in my elementary school – I, as a local councillor or government minister, tried to take on better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing against the luxury that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of choice or political appropriateness will deter me from acting in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to the top of the scale
Two late trials slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this wonderfully fun game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale, and they're the only unbeatable team of ten.
In the end, the weighing machine on the home side overshadowed their top defense and better exploiting the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“We have been through a lot of trials in our previous games, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayra team, opportunities have taken advantage of better than us.”
The 14-minute hit by Grant Anderson, turned by Frazier Clemo, led Ayr into a lead, but the yellow chart for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with the Warriors, represented a number of tunnels for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
At the time of the misdemeanor, Climo increased the lead for Ayr before he struck at halftime and then converted the independent attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggott, reduced the delay to five points.
It followed a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott, which was carried out on the stretchers, and after that Ayr advanced with the Stafford McDowal attempt turned by Clemo.
The interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with the unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for obstructing the climate without a ball, MacPherson scored a hit.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent Gregor Henry's wing player to the fifth attempt by the hosts.
Still Game Star Starts New Career in Hosting
Still Game Ford Kieran's star appears to be serving as a restaurant director.
56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Two of them announced that after the next ninth season, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of the company.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be included in the “flower feast” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
There are sea blue flags hanging in public buildings.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to repay it.”
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the longing for a repeat float in the Pacific.
This hope is now perhaps the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision, which will be received on 1 October after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit it expects the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of unconstitutional talks, Chile will have to negotiate access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here is Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations about Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body established in the Netherlands is not authorised to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after hearing final arguments means that the case was “not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they might cost her a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea," said Zárateev.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric from Chilence sucked up all the goodwill that may still be left, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the debates.
The state hasn't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had unusually taken a decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "conclusion of 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political support.
" Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea declared that nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States has called for the fulfillment of its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy at a dead end more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong if they think the continuation of sanctions and opposition will bring the end of the Korean war to North Korea on its knees.
Washington is careful to attach the forecast without Pjongjang taking decisive disarmament measures first.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pjongjang is taking seriously the abandonment of the weapons that the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest line of huge covers that come in the shops with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of covers or to hide completely from the sun, you do not need to keep looking.
In their spring and summer 2019 collections, Valentino and Thom Browne discovered on the fashion runway a collection of strange overcoats that blinded the style of the Paris fashion week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine's piece, which was the most extremity, was a beige-colored hat with wide ends decorated with feathers similar accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other excess fashion accessories included watermelons with expensive stones, a witch hat, and even a pineapple — but your head will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to that of a sinking machine with a breather and a pair of glasses, and the other looked like a cornnet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that giant blankets will come to the store near you.
Wide hats closely follow “La Bombi”, straw hat with 60-centimeter corners were observed in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
A cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another great creation after the fashion runway — a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit it was wearing.
The Rafi bag in a burnt orange color, lined with rhubarb riviera and white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacques for spring/summer 2019.
Stilist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive at the store for the next summer – because the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to overlook the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for global citizens
Scottish single schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results on exams, which are further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Single schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, a chosen career path and a place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted school programme, we can see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is an impression of memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother tongue, his words are in his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
The annual results of recent exams show that languages at the top of the scale with the highest performance rates in single schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign language achieved excellent marks.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Single Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved excellent grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish received excellent marks.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selection subject in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that for reasons for which employers may be struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent should be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
In future employment opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouGo survey, covering more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak foreign language well enough to be able to talk, with French being the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of respondents, which is 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools vary in the languages they teach in Scotland.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be the most important to the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, it will always be possible in independent schools to choose the many languages taught by experts in this field.
Scottish single schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Single schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be debuting Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' jersey
For fans who look forward to LeBron James' first performance as Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon be over.
The coach of Lakers' Luke Walton predicted that James would be playing the Sunday opening game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48”, explained Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The team's official rapporteur, Lakers Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“I don’t need a pre-season match at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's convention in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of gatherings in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled assemblies in the next week, including the arrivals of favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia convention, and where will it be possible to see it online?
Trump's convention in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern time.
Trump's Western Virginia convention can be seen live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about hearings of the candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, this week, who became tense about allegations of sexual misconduct, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be postponed for one week, so that the FBI will conduct the investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of assemblies is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to gain new momentum.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, these five assemblies committed “to encouraging volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The congressional supervision is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the difficult season,” Reuters was told by a representative of Trump's campaign who does not want to be appointed.
Today's Wesbanco Arena meeting in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews Radio, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend, which would attract the interest of Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where more than 40 percent of points were scored in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in public opinion research.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the President must come and “elevate” him in public research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team still wants to win and keep hope from Sunday's individual fights
After three one-sided games, it may well have been the Saturday afternoon duels of two (foursome) what Ryder's Cup needed this year.
A swinging swing is a totally imaginary sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially at such competitions.
So where's the swing now?
"They had six points of advantage and now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, as it leads for four points and twelve can get them.
However, the Americans feel that they have wind in their sails, among other things encouraged by the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points of four.
Spith was doomed from the initial blow to the vegetable plant and set a good example.
The shouts of happiness became louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and his two points behind leveled in the fourth game.
The punch that brought them victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to look for your inner strength and focus on your game,” said Spith.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to the glory.
In the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players with several points that Spith and Thomas have, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Unusual, yet charming, two Europes have won four out of four and are infallible.
Two Molliwoods were the only one who didn't hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, and the boogies also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way energy is clearly flowing between them and the noisy audience, confirms the fact that they are the same players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal any victory in Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
But preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in a four-ball game with Alex Noreen.
Because of the boogies and the two double buggies on the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish have fallen into a crisis from which they have not found a way out.
But the players won't have any help on Saturday.
The games with four balls and two fights are an exception to being closely monitored for communication between couples, advice they give themselves, advice they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the fights of the two two have shown that the US team also has a wish for victory, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's Cup with a nice advantage after after Saturday games with four balls and a duel of two leading from 10:6 to the United States.
The excellent couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best, and with two victories over Tiger Woods and Le Golf National, he won four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to win the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, played four - ball games in the morning over the American sinning team and led in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team had a better fight in two fights, where two games were won, but the backlog could not be compensated.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual duels if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while with Molinari (the couple named "Molliwood") after the sensational end of the week only the second couple, who won four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning the Woodes and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they again proved to be even more convincing in defeating the spent Woods and the American novelty Bryson Dechambeau of 5 and 4.
Woods, who crawled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of the 29 games in duels with four balls and two fights, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning games with four balls, returned for the fights of two two men and, in pair with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the Europe team.
Three times the winners Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they fought decisively against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, and then returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIrroy with 4 and 3 in two fights, losing the first two holes.
Just once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after four points behind the individual duels, even though Fury's team only needs an equalization to keep the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much to offer.
North Korea: "Without confidence, we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally"
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the further implementation of the sanctions caused an increasing lack of confidence in the United States and that, under such conditions, North Korea would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho said at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body that North Korea had adopted a number of “important measures in the sign of good faith” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile experiments, undermining the city for nuclear experiments and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, we will not be confident of national security, and under such conditions we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints made by North Korea regarding the resistance of Washington to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, within which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of progressive measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjongjang had done in the past.
Ri joined Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in a joint statement from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June. At that time, Kim committed himself to working for “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump North Korea promised security assurances.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pjongjang must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also did not give in to calls for the release of strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we must disarm ourselves first and put pressure on sanctions to achieve our goals by force, and even to oppose the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
The problem is that further implementation of sanctions further deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, highlighted by the US president at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jae Ino, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If we were to talk to South Korea and not the United States about the problem of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not agree on such dead points.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from that of last year when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that the attack on the continental part of the United States by North Korean rockets was inevitable, after Trump Kim’s “Mr. Evil President” referred to himself as “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage at the United Nations Assembly in taking disarmament measures last year, said he had much work to do and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time frame for this, and said: "Two years, three years or five months can last, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The imposition of sanctions on the Security Council must proceed decisively without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
He and Rie met at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongjang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he declared that progress had been made and that North Korea had criticised him for several hours if his demands were to be “gangster”.
At its meeting with Mun during this month, North Korea committed to undermining the missile testing station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes “the appropriate measures”.
Munu is said to say that the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and the measures taken to normalise relations with Washington are meant by “the appropriate measures”.
Harvard University students attend a course in learning how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course, they want to fight against the growing masturbating culture of “all-night” learning, where power is gained by caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world's best university often do not know the basics of self-care.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that according to his first such type in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided, after his lecture, on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said: “Why do I find out just now that I am in my senior year?”
She said no one's told her how important sleep is, and the Daily Telegraph told him it surprised him.
This year's first course is about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of university health services, says that such a course was decided when students were found to lack sleep significantly during the week.
The en route includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of the door of the student home, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers and books to obtain information on the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that student behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by cigarette smoking," adds Professor Cheisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present at the "survival of all-night learning". He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are a growing problem.
Professor Cheisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” of students to fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also avoid gaining weight – the brain, due to lack of sleep, is becoming hungry, which is why students are constantly hungry.
19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student Raymond Soe helped Professor Cheisler design a course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of his professors' lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that at the next stage he will be able to ask students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competition institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as awakening. He also wants to draw their attention to the harmful effects of “blue light”, which are broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalances in the circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sunk up Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston announced Steven Gerrard's team sentenced to 1 : 0.
The team from Ibrox was chasing its first guest victory after the February supremacy at St. Johnstone Stadium at 4: 1, but Gary Holt's team scored second in 18 matches since he headed the Gerrard team, which left his team for the leading team of the Scottish League with 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half expired, and the selected rangers did not seem to want to equalize.
This led the Rangers to fall to a common place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but the goal behind the team Hibernian
Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered a head injury when an object from the cheerleading team arrived after reporting.
In the crew, Gerrard defeated Ayr without difficulty and joined the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, he made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the verified equations of Livingstone, who had taken away the point of the Hearts team a week earlier, and was no doubt thrilled at how his flight team effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers, though, had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingstone made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short pitch, and then he went to Allan McGregor's goal, but he was tied up in the performance imprecise and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs’s free-shooting debt then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than they actually wanted to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a 15-minute race with Steven Lawless, a penalty shot would have to be committed, but Judge Steven Thomson was crushed by the Colombian's demands.
In the first half, Rangers managed to assemble only two shots at the goal, but not the head shot sent against the goal by Lassana Coulibaly, or Ovie Ayari's swing ball, was no threat to porter Liam Kelly.
Livingstone’s opening goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but he was already completely deserving of endurance.
The Rangers failed to cash out another Jacobs extension with a long shot.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's podium for a simple conclusion to the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly with the wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his lines and blocked the attack.
Nevertheless, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, making Lithgow and Halkett take care of more scores in front of the goal.
Holt's team could increase the lead towards the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inconclusive after passing from the corner.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton received the opportunity to fire a penalty shot at the end of the match after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
We represent a side from the almanac of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, who later became a world renowned physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
In the science world, he became a constant, and he also got his place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 Bells of Coronado, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientist:
Male: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactiveity in materials has on atoms.”
Evans: “Madam, they really are answering now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy attack cells
The vaccine in therapy learns the immune system to recognize attack cells
This method involves obtaining patient immune cells that are then modified in the laboratory
After this they can “see” a protein that is characteristic of a number of cancers, then returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise the ovary cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining patient immune cells that are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” HER2 protein, which is characteristic of a number of cancers, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesde, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several different types of cancers”, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to developing immune cells in patients who are “learned” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after performing at the SNL, performed a trampoline point with an MAGA inscription on the cap.
The Communion Was Not Impressed
He said that he would compete for the President's chair in 2020.
After performing his third song, “Ghost Town”, during which he wore a hat entitled “Mike America Great Again”, West launched an attack on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he is a racist?’”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
This time, the SNL launched a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player immersed himself in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but it was uploaded into the social media by Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems with the hat inscriptions.
“They went behind the stage to get me.
They told me “don’t go on stage with this hat”.
I've been harassed!
And they say I'm lost," he said after reporting Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that you have to put on “Superman’s robe because it means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His comments were prepared at least twice for the audience to whistle, and the SNL team was in obvious trouble, and someone said about Vanity: “In the studio there was a death silence.”
West was last-minute invited to a goat swap for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller rapper, died a few days earlier.
The West caused a lot of surprises already with a video video for the song “I Love It”, where he wore the costume of a bottle of mineral water brand Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of TPUSA's conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for BEING UPL TO PARAJI.”
Karen Hunter, the talk director, tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s just fine.
However, I am NOT going to reward someone (by buying his music, dressing or supporting his “art”), who, in my opinion, welcomes and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and will henceforth be “formally known as Kanye West. I am NOW YE.”
He's not the first musician to ever change his name, but he's already had Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an artist once known as Prince.
Male accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
Police say the event happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused must appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the Capital Game Kit Harrington starring against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for his sword swinging in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old actor who harshly condemned a masturbating hero's stereotype says that due to the appearance of such roles on the screens young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with perseverance.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something had gone wrong, and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem during the #IzToud period.
The player, who recently married a 31-year-old player from the Rose Leslie throne game, admitted that he had strong beliefs about the subject.
"I personally ask myself at the moment where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood," he said.
“What have we taught men during growing up about the problems we now face?”
Kit thinks that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of manhood due to the display of very manly characters.
He continued: “What was born and what was taught?
What do they teach us on television and in the streets that young boys feel they need to choose this particular side of manhood?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change that?
Because there was obviously something wrong with young men.”
In his interview, he also said that after the end of the series, he would not be involved in filming any pre-history or continuation of the Games of the Thrones, because he “cold with battles and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard performance, which is the story of the film producer and his brother's robber.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that had happened because of the Games of the Thrones was that he had met his wife, Rose, in the recording.
“For this series I met my wife, so that in some way she gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte in a fantasy show with Emmy, the Love Chorus of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases reported from China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been sexually transmitted, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan decreased to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing annually by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a very pressing problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against persons within the LGBT community remains very high.
As conservative values still apply in the country, according to the results of the studies, 70-90 % of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of its efforts to solve the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines to treat HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have issued data on Republican senators, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected the charges that a member of her staff had published information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these accusations come from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"Lyings, lies and more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter statement.
The published information appears to include the home addresses and telephone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of the State of Utah.
This data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court Judge Brett Kanaugh.
There was a leak after the three senators had completed the Kavanaugh hearing.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, indicate that the IP address identifies a source of publication that should be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information was published by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These baseless accusations are entirely false and pure lies” continues Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leak of this data.
These baseless accusations are completely false and pure lies.”
On the Internet, Senator Waters' statement quickly came across criticisms, including by former White Press House representative Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of anger” wrote Fleischer.
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show any anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the accused.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections for the city of Waters, responded via Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her cabinet had informed the relevant institutions and authorities of the prosecution of these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as undercover agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and it also applies to the revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy, which came on screen for the first time in 2003 with the title Johnny English and the continuation in 2011 by Johnny English 2.
Will there be a fun satire about how shitty we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes swollen and unusual cheeks, gets permission to reshuffle the protagonists; his name already indicates that it is a comic figure created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the one who contributed to the last note of Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
Also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV advertisement for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wore medieval armor, and the sheets of a rotor were dealt with for a short time by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems a little mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films, like 007 or Mission impossible now without the bad conscience, offer comic elements.
It seems as if humor is intended for children and not so many adult viewers, and it is therefore not as innovative and oriented for me as the Atkinsons sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now clearly that Britain is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the web network of British top secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the point of the breakthrough for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who, because of political dislikability, has already experienced a breakdown: Emma Thompson, however, has tried to act as an alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the script that can help herself.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to decide for one of the retired spies.
And this means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who informally teaches how to operate under cover: here the writers are hit because English performs some sort of spy “rock academy”.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets with longtime associate Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotyped sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is almost lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more problems on behalf of Her Majesty's secret service, and they meet the loser Ophelio Bulletov played by Olga Kurylenka.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed in a waiter set fire in a French restaurant, create chaos when they squirm on the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house, he succeeds in creating general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sweetness and energy it resembles a child's film.
Very average.
Like the other movies of Johnny English, I can't help myself here, and I think, "Is the British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?"
Laburists deny that the British plan a four-day work week, with a five-day salary.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five - day payment.
A party from business leaders wants the savings created by companies for the revolution of artificial intelligence to spill over to the workers and give them an extra day off.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say that the idea corresponds to the customer's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
Unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of a changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party stated for The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve through the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the customer.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week work week in its campaign in the general elections in 2017.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party’s policy and the party does not think about it.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take out the power of “non-profit directors” and “receipters” in municipal companies.
In the shadow of the chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain the full share, as the laborist party could, on the basis of alleged faults, introduce “returns”.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in boards of directors and to introduce equity funds, which would transfer 10 per cent of the share of private companies to employees receiving annual dividends of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the 60 minutes series, discussed whether their opinion could change the Kavanaugh investigation conducted by the FBI.
The investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the 60-minute program, Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could find anything to change their minds about.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this accusation came, I asked him, “Did you do it?””
He was determined, unrestrained, unequivocal.”
And Graham's voice seems carved into stone.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett strongly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I do not see any new changes.”
What was the Global Citizens' Festival (Global Citizens Festival) and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event where there is a truly remarkable kind of star and which has the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will be sitting on the Grand Line of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “act” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How successful, though, is the Global Citizen movement, which has been 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them that they are demanding action, or is this just another example of what is called “clictivism” – creating the belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation of signing online petitions or broadcasting tweets?
Global Citizen's move suggests that more than 19 million "acts" of its supporters are to be recorded in the effort to achieve a range of different goals since 2011.
He says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In 2018, the group indicated that the product of its actions should be 390 commitments and communications, which have already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that up to now the funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), a partnership of investors and decision makers, committed to “help children achieve their full potential”, which the Rwandans promised $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 sts of movement for the global citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourself, we can place the social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of the Partnership Power Food, in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken by the Government, which called on the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, it had announced that it would co-finance a project called Power of Nutrition to reach 5 million women and children through food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizens movement replied: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Among some performers who will take part in this year's New York event are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the US Ministry of the Interior as a “blockage” for Russian energy exports.
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke is expected to say, following Washington Examiner's report, that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
However, according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy shall ensure that our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy from leaking to the market”, he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group, which is known as the "vote of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less of an impact on and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick-knowing pony” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration was seeking to increase its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it was intended to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” pipeline project Northern Stream 2, which is supposed to make Moscow a hostage after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern Stream 2 pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is supposed to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
Cremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy must not be a tool for carrying out pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after his September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral arrangements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Integrating a third country into our energy supply means a great deal to me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" her candidacy in the elections for the US President in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "exactly study" her candidacy for the US President after the mid-term elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her candidacy.
“It’s time to go to Washington women and correct our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” said Officer The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine my candidacy for President closely."
At the meeting in the city house, Warren was rewarded by President Donald Trump because "this country is supposed to lead in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I am terribly worried,” she said.
Warren and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, have been openly criticized several times.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before the elections, we need an FBI investigation.”
The survey published on Thursday, however, showed that most of its own voters felt that Warren’s position should not be promoted in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk Political Research Centre/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eighty percent of “probable” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that the former Governor of Deval Patrick had greater support for the candidacy, with 38% of respondents supported and 48% opposed.
The other high-level Democrats who would take account of the elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Bidn said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump mentioned a posttraumatic stress disorder called Track Palina.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son experiences after his return connects me with other families who are coping with post-traumatic stress disorder and a measure of the injury that our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s son’s arrest was referred to as “an elephant in a salon” and said that her son and other veterans were returning slightly changed, stiff, wondering where the respect for what soldiers and airmen and all other members of the army had donated to the country.”
Track Palina was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by attacking a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of weapons, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Wasilla.
18 federal states and Colombian District support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new American policy that denies asylum rights to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district on Friday filled the courtroom to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the complainant in Grace's action against Sessions, which the American Association for Civil Liberties Against Federal Policy has not published.
She said that her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang”, had abused her, but the American authorities rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are made in the United States, as countries that are constantly coping with problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy repealed the decision of the Immigration Appeal Committee, which allowed undetected immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has despised decades of state, federal and international law".
“Social law requires all asylum requirements to be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the Court of Justice states.
The state prosecutors further stated on the request that policies that deny immigrants the right to enter harm the American economy as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and are supposed to "provide the necessary labour".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Assistance is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or political opinion”, said Sessions on 11 June in his publication of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Paluj has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are under way to find survivors.
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very intense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusum, as she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in Palo.
"The rescuers carry bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce.”
The city seemed to be returning to destroyed homes, beating themselves through wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwight Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside the army hospital in Paluj, where patients were treated outdoors because of persistent severe earthquakes.
When he remembered a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he lived with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get rid of them.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he was with his family in town for the wedding.
“I heard the woman calling for help and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “insulting” with “propaganda ads”
One week after the publication of the four-party advert of the official Chinese newspaper in the U.S. daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to Beijing accused U.S. press abuses of propaganda.
Last Sunday, US President Donald Trump mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to the newspaper Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after China accused interference in the US congressional elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Reuters reported that the US federal officials of Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US federal elections described it as a new phase in Washington's growing efforts to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange strikes by introducing customs into imported products.
China's reimbursement tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in federal countries, such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, were said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and formerly longtime Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday issue of Officer Des Moines Register, "now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the prized American tradition of free speech and free printing to publish the paid ad in the Post of Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic path, as the Chinese Communist Party strictly controls," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans lose voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh, warn analysts
Analysts point out that despite more sexual assault charges, the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and advocate a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh will be known in the upcoming mid-term elections with the loss of voters.
The emotions here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue with the vote.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow, nor November,” said Karina Jean-Pierre, Senior Counselor and National Representative of the MoveOn Advanced Group, on Friday, following a report by the Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the Senate Hall, when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, news portal Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will exceed all limits,” said the portal to journalists by Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst.
“People say they’re strong now, and that’s true.
However, it could be even stronger, especially among unspecified voters in suburbia and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the President, but do not often vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council, following the NBC News report earlier this week.
“It’s not just the voting of the world or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s capris; it’s also the way Republicans deal with it and how they have dealt with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Group of Priorities, who supports Democrats in the elections.
The Americans seem somewhat divided between whether they believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony more, with a little more support from the latter.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure to believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh for sure or the most.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying about the testimony, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Following Flake FBA's pressure, he is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported the officer of The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Court of Justice under oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, had attacked her in a guilty state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to start a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, opens a starter company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt's purpose was "to rule the world".
“We decided to do this now”, said the new company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable users to create a "personal storage" or sub-data storage facility
This may include contact details, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage warehouse is that the user can fully identify who can access which information.
The company calls this "personal data enforcement".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission."
In Saturday's publication on the Media portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of integrity and the quality of a new web built on the Solid platform".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a consortium of World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“In view of the next period of the web, I am extremely optimistic,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Festival for Victoria’s Cross Carrier from World War I
For 100 years in the home town, the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the Church of England has been celebrated as a fighter in World War I.
The honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellengelis and Lehoucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never found out that he had been granted the highest British military honor.
On Saturday at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two colonel's grandchild discovered a memorial stone.
One of the great - grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act of merit.
According to a report by Officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of St. Quintine “through a very dense fog and under the powerful fire of the battlefield and machine guns.”
Later, he set sail against the line of fire and led the line forward with “the greatest heroism” and then attacked the machine gun and hit three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper just a month before the end of the war on 4 October 2018.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of my old father were “something I know and could never accomplish, so teach me humility. ”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, a wreath was laid after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade” and “that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express.”
Fans of mixed martial arts spent all night watching Bellator 206.
Imagine: You spent all night watching a completely sold out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to see each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed to discover that the transmission had been replaced by playing the Pigs Pep cartoon.
He was not impressed by many, for he remained awake until morning due to a duel.
One of the enthusiasts on Twitter described the switch to a child's cartoon as "a kind of painful joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Pearce Pepe.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he was trying to adjust the schedule by including viewers in the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about playing again, I think we can manage this,” said Coker.
“But then there is a sixth hour on Sunday morning and we will not be able to handle it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were a number of messages exchanged when the switch was over, and not everyone was nice.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the real reason was a government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
Instead of the six we will endure five fights – as usual. We have tried to offer more than expectations to fans and we have saved ourselves.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less valuable" about sexuality.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation he felt less worthy of everyone – but this gave him motivation for success.
A 24-year-old said that "not everyone like himself" was aware of entering high school.
In his first talk at Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne at Radio 4 radio station, he said that he spoke about gay rights in order to give others “hope”.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
The regular head of a longtime show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for months.
Daley, who appeared as an outlaw in Laverne’s first show, said that he felt “less valuable” than everyone else, “because it was not socially acceptable for us to like boys and girls.”
He said: “So far these feelings of inferiority and diversity are a real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something”, said he would not disappoint anyone who finally learned about his orientation.
Two times, the bronze Olympic competitor became an influential advocate of LGBT-rights and appeared twice this year at the Games of Nations Communities in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that he was romantically involved with a man – American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “presembled him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, reported last year, but said that the difference in years never meant a problem.
“When you experience so many young people” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died – he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, a couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Dalley's son, and Daley says that this changed his "whole view".
“If I were asked last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to reach the gold medal’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit first.
I couldn't say to him, "This time you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally have to admit that he was not invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in the Olympic games in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first selection of songs — the stream of music by Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparing for the Olympic Games and which still gives him the skin.
Desert Island Discs broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson is the Saturday Ryder Cup sitting
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game at Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back in shape so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who's going to be a record 12th time in a bienal event, left Captain Furyk sitting on Saturday fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the event, as it has been so often for the United States, the five-time winner of the day has spent part of the day as a fan and part in improving his game to correct what weighs him.
Given that he did not measure the most straight at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old does not match Le Golf National's best narrow playground, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missed punches.
And if only the playground wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will be dealing with the exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari on Sunday's 9th game, which was connected to the new Tommy Fleetwood in all four games this week.
If the Americans who play four games at the beginning of the 12 individual games were to start well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he did not say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, he put me on his back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's one of the celebrities, and he's made a tremendous contribution to the teams in the past, and this week too.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it happened, and we thought it had to be done.
He wants to play, like everyone else.”
Mickelson is going to break Nick Falda's record Sunday for the largest number of games played at the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence on the team also brings some insatiable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and it’s great to have him in a team space,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they moved in with him this week, which was fun to look at."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be gained
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of individual games at Ryder's Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
In 1997 the young Danek debuted at the Valderram game, where the side of which the captain was Sve Ballesteros had five points of advantage over the Americans, and through the finish line she had only a hair advantage, with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; a great advantage we had in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but barely,” said Bjorn (in picture) after watching the team Class of 2018 , which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and led the playing field Le Golf National led from 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the Cup isn't over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The race isn't over until it's written like that on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
All the time he says that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added, enthusiastic about playing his players on a challenging playground: “This is where I would never have gone too fast.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
The game of individuals will be at the forefront of tomorrow, so it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, and when you're alone there, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you have to convey to the players: You have to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk himself had already been on both sides of the coup in the last day, as he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in the Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, led his players on the last day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as soon as we saw it in Brooklyn as we saw it in Medina.
When this momentum is sustained, it exerts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way that we felt we would do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and fighting Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"In this group of boys I have decided on this order because I think it covers the whole schedule," Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
A new German warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be handed over in 2014 in order to replace the ageing warship from the cold war, but due to the disruption of systems and rapidly increasing costs, local municipalities have been reported not to be at least until next year.
The handover of the ship “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now being transferred to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who lists the military representative.
The vessel should be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is concerned about the issue of delivery.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigate class.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance distances – the latest frigates are expected to remain out of the domestic port for up to two years.
The constant delays, however, mean that the supreme warships, which would allow Germany to exert its power in the overseas, will become obsolete by the time the use begins, states Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are limited, and Germany's dresses have cited a number of key “programme and technical deficiencies”, which would make warship useless if it were to be deployed to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce in the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved to be a heavy ship, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's chances for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is expected to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the missing equipment, the price of the entire project – including training of the crew – has become a problem.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion dizzying (USD 3.6 billion) from the start of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is in fact "missing ships fit for deployment".
The official said that the issue had been sharpened over time because old ships had been dismantled and the replacement vessels had not been provided.
He regretted that no ship from Baden-Wuertemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Hidden Life of Bats
A new study is being carried out on the Scottish Highland estate, which seeks to identify how bats use food for hunting.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flight mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats and brown earrings of bats and peripheral bats on the property of Inverew Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites, they will set up special recorders to monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kinds of things they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and conservation of bat forests and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and the loss of habitat.
Risks are also represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as molds and some types of chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But night hunting habits help each other to hunt prey more with their ears than with their eyes.
The sophisticated echolocation technique is used to accurately identify errors and obstacles on the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the supply of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, is taking bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, checks on shelters and occasional rescue.
In the area of Dumfries and Galloway, the organization has established even the first and so far the only Scottish reserve, specifically designed for bats.
The owner of the property, David Thompson, says the property is ideal for them.
“There is a great area for bats on Threav,” he said.
»We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to do.”
It stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance works on holdings, since the possible accidental destruction of one single bat maternity cell could lead to the death of up to 400 females and pups, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, therefore they are forbidden to kill, harass or disturb, and they are also prohibited from destroying their maternity homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply do not know how well their populations are being held.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers prepare to press charges against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape charges as “false news” and said that people wanted to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to press charges against the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay $37,000 for her silence on the event.
When addressing 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting Ronaldo, 33, referred to the reports as “false news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," the five-time Golden Ball winner said in camera.
"By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man, and I want all well," the actor added smilingly.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing for Der Spiegel's lawsuit for accusations called "unacceptable reporting on suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “insurmountable damage in amounts that correspond to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at Mayorg's nightclub with Ronald, she was supposed to be raped there by an anal rapist.
According to Mayorga, after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that “99% is a good man” who disappoints only in “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she was headed to the police and that she had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, and then agreed to a court-martial because she was “a terrible fear of revenge” and was concerned with “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims to want to cancel the settlement, as the alleged incident continues to cause severe trauma.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, worth $100 million, to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would regret forever the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would regret forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer following peaches, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that the exit of Great Britain from the EU would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby without an agreement.
“We need an agreement”, said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of brixite without agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that in the event that the UK withdraws from the European Union at the end of March without agreement, production in our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at the Burnaston factory.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also expressed concern about the impact of the exit from the European Union without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit for a month, it would close its Mini factory in Oxford.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the supply chain risks in the case of brixite.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “right time” principle, with parts of UK and EU suppliers arriving on order every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU on 29 March without agreement, this could result in disturbances at the borders that industry representatives say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota, in its Derbyshire factory, could not store for more than a day parts, said the company's representatives, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely moderate to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity”, he told us about the broadcast of Today's BBC Radio 4.
“The data not only of Toyota but also of other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would have been stopped and in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Union trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job never returns.”
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, says the White House
The important meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, could be "moved for another week" due to the ongoing fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, links between Trump's associates and Russia, and potential President's obstruction of the judiciary.
The question is whether Trump will dismiss the prosecutor general and threaten Mueller's independence for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretap device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House in the middle of reporting that he intended to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump at the United Nations conference in New York was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would rather not forgive, and then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict by hearing the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-day investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press rep, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for the meeting is not yet set. It could happen this week, according to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, but it could be postponed for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure you are informed.”
Some rapporteurs would object to this. Sanders has not called a White House meeting with reporters since 10 September.
Chris Wallace's show manager asked her why.
Sanders said that the few meetings were not to be attributed to the "putting" of TV reporters, but said: "I couldn't deny that they were being put up."
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds several press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without stating the source: "We have looked at the figures."
The meetings will still be held," said Sanders. "If journalists can turn directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than discussing it with me.
This is what we are trying to make possible, and you have seen that in the last few weeks we have often done so and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with the statesmen in the guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he was free of charge and partly bizarre in front of a group of journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in the NHS Scotland on the fear of peaches
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire to continue the work after the luxuries.
Jeanne Freeman, SMEs, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, as decisions were brought closer to the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line supporter, Christion Abercrombie, suffered a head injury Saturday's defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ from The Tennessee newspaper.
The head coach at Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury took place only moments before the half-life.
“He got to the edge of the playground and sort of collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the playground before placing it on the stretchers and taking it off the playground for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV Channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details of the type/range of injury are not yet known” and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday he took five blows together before leaving the game, which raised his total number of blows in the season to 18 blows.
A higher fee will be charged to foreign buyers when buying property in the United Kingdom
A higher tax will be charged to foreign buyers when buying property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to new Torian plans
The move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
An increased amount will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The trustee expects her to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, and she's going to use them to help the homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher level of stake when buying properties in the United Kingdom and the money collected will be for the homeless, and Theresa May will be notified today.
The move must be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure affordable housing and to tax higher incomes.
The increased amount will be charged to persons and businesses not paying taxes in the United Kingdom and additional money will encourage the Government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The premium – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and rental properties – could be no less than three percent.
The trustee expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that the United Kingdom's non-states will buy 13 percent of the newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and more difficult purchases of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit sites”, as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the size of the young to buy their first home.
The large construction companies have accused the increase in prices by looting the land, which they do not actually use, and Mr Mayevo has called for the suspension of quotas for affordable housing in order to repair the British "residential shame".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the end of forced evictions without errors.
Moreover, he wants to give city councils greater authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: "Last year I said that I would devote my prime management to restoring British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy a home is as simple as for the Garatian British citizens.
For too many people the dream of home is too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland Club"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is once to become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Škot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first grade.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I received a B cap and that was it," Ross told us about the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland more often as a child in Hampton, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if I were successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic team chief, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he did not feel fear as a successor to such great names.
“Success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’”
According to the structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs in the First League," he said.
“The way to there is not easy, but I would probably count myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross only worked for three years after he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months part of Hearts training staff.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league from falling, and St Mirren led off the edge to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough”, Alloe recalled.
“I was really sure that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as a player, and I had a relatively good time with it, and I also achieved some greater success.
But the game can become difficult.
Every week we have to face a lot of things.
This is what I still face in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for myself.
I always wanted to run a club and now I do it. In my skin in my entire adult life now I feel the most comfortable.”

Research result: ideal time for beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of the heavily beating British pubs, but pressure has also increased on the restaurant chains.
In July, pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business advisor to the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The permanent solar time and participation of England in the world cup that lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June last month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were affected even more strongly.
The drop in restaurant traffic increased by 1.8% in June.
The traffic in pubs and drinking bars has increased more in comparison to the traffic in restaurants.
As a result of solar weather, the sale in pubs, which offer mainly food, has also been reduced, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent in one month and the sale of food decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM said: “These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When selling on the catering market, the biggest factors remain the time and impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, even though the fall of 4.8 percent on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of food bars, the long hot summer could not come at a more wrong time and only time will it tell whether the necessary recovery will bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.”

One of five children has a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents.
Research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have a secret account on the social network that is kept from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News has strengthened fears of sex-related content
Twenty percent of students said they had a parent account
One of the five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates an account on social networks that is hidden from parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has reinforced fears of publishing with the sexuality of related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage the censored “main” account shown to their parents and also have private accounts.
The mother, who happened to run into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that the daughter of the visitors was being asked to rape her.
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) has shown that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom are recognised as having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "He is concerned that so many teenagers succumb to temptation and create an online space in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be “the voice of athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete on the ground and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to benefit from its extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community. We are convinced that, with its involvement in the committee, athletics in Scotland would gain enormously,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help in running sports in Scotland.”
An American who won a total of four Olympic medals at 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has been distributed by web-based opinions
The company producing the pumps has divided its opinions by an ad comparing the mothers to the cows in the mussel.
For the start of the marketing of the "first silent portable pump", the consumer technique company Elvie published a provocative music video ad which should show mothers all the freedom the aid provides.
Four real mothers dance in a cow company in a haystack, on a song that includes the following words: “Yes, I am pumping, but there is no tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my hairs, these are my tits.”
The chorus continues: “Exhaust, wear out, feed the babies, wear out, wear out, squeeze the breasts.”
However, an ad that was posted on Facebook’s website caused considerable discomfort online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying he was joking about the “grozot” of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and cattle to produce milk, but their children are stolen in the first days after the anchoring," one wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mothers and cubs.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers keeping their children?"
Someone else added: "Ad completely unfeeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she found the song "to die funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I'd still breast-feed.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I understood it, just as I thought it would be.
This is a genius product," another wrote.
Someone commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who exhaust their milk (often in a workplace or a toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who draw breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even outdoor activities while drawing milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD in mothers, continued to comment. “The pump Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he earned a bold and provocative presentation.”
By pulling a parallel between women who draw milk and cows milkmaids, we wanted to put in the spotlight the drawing of milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way that women can connect with, we wanted to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the model trail walked for designer Martha Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has risen significantly, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be handed over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are therefore afraid of putting their children's application at risk of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand over fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Agency for Immigration and Customs, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are convicted foreigners.
That is why we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court one month after they were detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers in the shelter said.
Many will come forward with a video conference call, not in person, to defend themselves before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for assistance will be promptly expelled.
As long as the children are in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to prison workers' statements and reports made in the system in recent months.
Proponents said that you are more concerned about larger institutions, such as Tornill, where signs of child distress due to their size are likely to remain undetected.
They added that moving children to the tent city without being emotionally prepared or given a chance to praise their friends could complicate the trauma that many of them are facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupationary forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though war has been waged in the country for eight years.
Moals, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "collect accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the Assembly.
Moualem said that the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, “almost completed”.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until the Syrian territory is cleansed” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
In Syria, the United Nations has approximately 2,000 soldiers, who mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn territory.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for them were suitable for return and charged “some Western countries” with “the spread of unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
"The international community and humanitarian organisations have been called upon to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive any renewal until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last important rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “a clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Fronta Nusr associated with Al-Qaida, which would be “imposed”.
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first session of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a postwar constitution for Syria and press the road to elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to “to review the articles of the current constitution” and to warn against interference.
Why will Trump reach his second term?
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpolation and scandal.
Which would no doubt be “the most dramatic final presidency ever!”
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million during the peak viewing period, while MSNBC’s ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the peak time, which after Nielsen more than four years ago, when it was 1.7 million, the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designed Survival”, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognized written comedy and author of the book “Only funny parts: and some hard truths about snooping in the Hollywood Boys Club”, offers a different explanation.
Remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’ said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a funny value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears to be on television, the story from Washington could decide on the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, six hours of watching the round table of experts discussing the use of the “deep background” resource for Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, $15,000 worth of coats from ostrich leather (“dress, thickly subjected to puffs”, said Officer The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump’s, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
“The part of his work, which impresses the reality of the show, is to offer something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars on Trump’s performance and daily screenplay (the match with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Un).

There was no way he could have been torn off, nor when Brett Kavanaugh faced a Senate committee and was in the air hanging the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember that at the time we created all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money to prepare for the tightest mid-term parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district there is a flood of money, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat due to the remodeling of congressional districts.
This is the home of Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district, in the newly divided suburb of Pittsburgh.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn on a new one when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge in January ruled that the old districts were anti-constitutionally sketched for the benefit of Republicans.
The event in the new 17th district touched on the fight to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Democratic Campaigns Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to Democrats.
In the US, sanctions against Salvador were being considered for support from China, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
The officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to call off the American leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, “a recent decision to terminate the recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were being considered regarding Salvador, which was estimated to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included the limitation of financial aid and the targeted restriction on visa issuance, would seriously affect this Central American country, with a high unemployment rate and a number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus completing their reflection on Salvador's sentences.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference participants, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the US government attaches to the meeting, has added to the diplomats.
However, three American envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them under the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government and also spoke about it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now in the public record of very much evidence.
Mr. Mueller is also to point the investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr Trump will have to answer before this organ, and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues, just as he is preparing to address his constituents again.
There are many questions about this, and I do not want to claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that affect how long-lasting the battle could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler if the West resisted him and in Munich supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
At such milestones, the flow of history changes and accelerates or blocks the relentless march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with a number of these fractures right now.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man with the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this officer reported that he proposed a covert recording of the President last year and speculated on his inadequacy for this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said the officer's report was incorrect.
»How will we react if the FBI's requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair or is appointed supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress demanding Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, there will be a long winter of democracy.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light a swastika candle on the table.

Ranger Graham Dorrant optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the union player Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season ahead of the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a point of departure for larger achievements.
"This was a worthy point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point away.
In the end, we may be able to win a victory, but in general, the rhemium is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am convinced with a crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
This past year has certainly been difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Poor sleep of women because of fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear picture of how they were to be cared for, few people and their family members were involved in this discussion.
Half of the survey respondents in the Nationvide insurance company said they were discussing long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said that they were talking to children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member but do not try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector at the Nationwide Insurance Company.
You can start the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare a family to care for you if you do not discuss this with her in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, since this can be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs or self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the time of transition.
Choose a healthcare professional so that you can determine the trust of a person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts will respect your medical wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also authorising a person for his finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Keep in mind the few details: Imagine that your elderly parent desperately needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims was expected to increase.
At the end of the communication connections, rescuers from the Donggal regency, the area north of Paluj, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5., could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Paluj.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavez and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulavezi.
The county administrative unit was estimated to have a population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulavez are aquaculture and farming, in particular in the central region of Donggal.
In the province, the mining of nickel is also an important activity, which is mainly carried out in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of the Consequences of Natural Disasters, Palu and Donggalo have repeatedly suffered tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
In 1996, the tsunami hit northern Donggala and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an earthquake-related Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been:
2004: The larger earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis affecting 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the coast of the Indian estimate, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit West Sumatra late in March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis of up to 10 meters, which destroyed a dozen villages and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jay's regency in Aceh was affected by the shallow earthquake and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami didn't start, but the buildings that fell caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palina, the eldest son of the former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for suspected domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, took the phone out of hand.
The Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Predictory Institute and detained under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the KTUU TV network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "probably innocent" when asked about the defence, the network reported.
The Palinas were charged with three Class A offenses, which means that they could close him up to one year and fine him $250,000.
He was also accused of a class B offense punishable by a single day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time we've been charged with a crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, involvement in family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticized the veteran groups when the violent behaviour of her son connected with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
A tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut off and death tolls are expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on the social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami struck the coast, there were hundreds of people staying at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City.
The U.S. Attorneys in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sifull Saip, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City where eight people have died, and it's been a rare punishment for federal crimes in the country that they haven't committed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is expected to use the rental truck to carry out an attack on a cycling route along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, when he rode several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, it is recorded in a death penalty notice filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, any of the charges may be the cause of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, Saip's grand jury made 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in support of extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and slander”, said the prosecutors, who described Saip’s way as “stupid, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaewic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draka, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” is written in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District District Court handed down the last death sentence ten years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, and finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last handed down in New York City in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saip told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he had watched on the phone to perform the attack.
The police also said that they had requested the spread of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
With regard to the 22 counts of the indictment, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the plea of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong suffering in connection with these events,” Patton said.
The Saip Defence Group had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
For the negotiations on brexite, we should entrust Nigel Faragea, a true Tory MP
During today's protest at the Torian conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the human army".
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians must “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members, Theresa May, proposed that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would “be out now” if Mr Farage's secretary of luxury were.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayev in coordinating her deep-separated species was highlighted by the Tori, who favoured the failures of the luxuries that had joined a separate protest against luxuries in the city.
The prime minister is committed to maintaining his plan in the process between attacks by brixite, brixite opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "cocas".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (department means going) in Solihuul to "wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said we should appoint Mr Farage as our accomplice and assign him the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would be out by now," he said.
This Wellingborough Member added: "I will support the luxuries, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
The EU's opposition was described in the following words: "In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The thought of the British having changed their mind and wanting to remain in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting there was also a Tori peaches named Andrea Jenkyns, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our client and our activists, who are active in the streets and lead us to an election at all.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs Mayeve, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given “feeling hot” if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to issue a peach, and today we are gathered together to say to them, ‘We won’t let you do this.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the heat of our political class, which is on the edge of the issue of brixite.”
“We are mobilising the human army of this country, which has provided us with a victory in luxury, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a double meeting in the city center.
After the formation of the group, a handful of activists waved the Torians against the Brixite flag this weekend.
The Labour Tribe Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because of the security problems in using the client's application after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all technology for the Canada plus, for the border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland”, he added.
“It’s the perfect farce.
There is no such thing as good peaches," he added.
Warren's possible push for president's position will "examine"
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says "co-operation in the presidential seat will be carefully examined" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation so that we can fight Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of “town hall”, since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to fight for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for "the woman in Washington to be corrected by our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect for shooting LSU Wayd Sims basketball player on Friday.
The police station in Baton Roug has been briefed on the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11pm Eastern Time.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near South University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and died eventually," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, 247sports reported.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that there was an incident at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and taken to the police station at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Roug, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, on average with 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russian Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion, and the team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettle win.
On Saturday it became the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that "the Mercedes team would have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas got off to a good start at the start and almost let Hamilton dry when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel led the first one into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
After a few driving actions, Mercedes led him into the box later and left him behind, but Hamilton noticed that the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inside open and risked falling behind after two moves to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in seventh place.
He then drove most of the game without changing the tires because he intended to perform fast finishes, beat Kim Raikkonen, and occupy the fourth city.
He finally got into boxing in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight laps, he couldn't raise his speed, so Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It's been a tough day since Valtteri drove fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team did a really remarkable job to reach first and second place," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad physical rumor.
At Saturday's meeting, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate Investigation Commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and false".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false”, he said.
“When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, ‘No, I did not do it’.”
I didn't do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer ... you disclosed the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we didn't," he added with regard to the impression about the senator.
Ford's letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and the media was disclosed in early September – but Feinstein's denial that it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter,” according to Officer The Hill Feinstein’s report to the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it as confidential as she asked."
However, her denial obviously did not match the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, this was a really bad body talk.
It may not be true, but it was the worst word of the body I had ever seen.”
In defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, and who they have to hit to break through to power and control," the president said following a report from the Mediate website.

Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were tied to the home page, and then Dwyer regained the advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundees before two naked Lundwald Nielsen guaranteed them victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundees at 2:1 on Friday night.

Air traffic controller has enabled hundreds of people on board to escape from an earthquake by their death
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero after sacrificing their lives that a plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
On Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be shaken by severe earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunavan Agung did not leave his post in a highly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained there that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was tearing himself down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian Media House ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“Our heart breaks when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency for Disaster Reduction in the State said that access to the cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase further as there were a number of bodies under the rubble, but many were unable to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Palu, where the mass burial will take place on Sunday, was ravaged by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Any minute, a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
It's running out of clean water.
Minimarkets are all over the place.«
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy which can become much worse."
On Sunday, President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Pal and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?« Following CNN reporting.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia aeroplane collapse: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that there is one man missing after the initial announcement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the diving aircraft.
Air Niugini reported missing male passenger on Saturday afternoon in a press release.
They told the airline that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing.
At the call for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday they took seven people to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers at the hospital who were all in stable condition on Saturday.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just outside the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went very low.
“That’s extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that, along with other passengers, he managed to break through the water reaching the belt to emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said the stewardess started panic and screamed, and he suffered minor head injuries himself.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were repairing the pier had also jumped to help. They were helping themselves to rescue by using an inflatable boat that led people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in the last two decades of aviation accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial of a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his phone records to determine the movement of a 29-year-old defendant named Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received the location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, according to Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber's at the time he said he was with a friend named Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was "lying because he was a [my] truck in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
Records on your cell phone show you've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of his death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” said Hale.
The defence is due to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury was to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hippie?
Hiphop Trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hiphop has distanced itself from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and remake conscious hiphop popular.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently experienced a resurgence in the United Kingdom with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
The New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her for a "racist" message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatingly dismissing her after receiving the wrong message from her mother, who complained that she was "one black."
Couples deny racist treatment and compare the lawsuit with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, discovered that she was black.
“NOEEEE ONE MORE BLACK” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After finding her failure, Plasco-Flaxmanov, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job and wanted to hire a Filipino, reported New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a payment for one day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice’s request for compensation from couples in court now amounts to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, these things are not done”, she said about the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after the outrage.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
Not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told us about the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
In comparison to the "exclusion" lawsuit, Plasco said that his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will you handle someone like this?
This is not very nice," he added to the investment banker.
Even though the trial is still in progress, the Court of Public Opinion of the Couples on Social Networks has quickly condemned his behaviour and way of thinking.
The publishers of the story of the Paddington Bear were afraid that readers would not connect to the talking bear, a new letter revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who has read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very amusing to find out now that Paddington has become an extraordinary success.”
She said that her father, who at first worked as a cameraman for the BBC before receiving an inspiration to write a baby book about a little bear toy, was bitter when he rejected his work, added that after his death last year she was the 60th anniversary of the book "granco-sweet".
Regarding the Paddington bear, described as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“There were these men who did not like to boast,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him, even though you are not really doing it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's bear in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, his success was always attributed to Paddington's bear itself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors sought to preserve her life for nothing.
“Hope regularly called to say that she felt really bad that she did not expect this to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received Nad’s call. He told me that in the next two minutes she would die, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly absorbed and abandoned by her system.
She had been dying for some time, and it was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position when my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was now grieving for her daughter’s loss, boarded the plane with other passengers who were not aware of the test she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head bowed, and tears were running through my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving female glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide try to turn others away in order to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valiant Bridge... put up posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he got depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted up every room.”
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about the domino effect. ”
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies for many years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was totally on the ground. When the children opened a gift, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but she had to be treated: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for — after the duration and extent of the limited investigation — this might unify us,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was falling apart because of the established customer closure.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
By the mid-November 6th mid-term elections, it is only for five more weeks — if the Republicans are expected to cut off badly — that will make them very weak in trying to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was presented by his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when an FBI agency prepares a report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can collect at least 50 votes, which would bring a breakthrough to Mike Pence, vice-president, and an election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean MP.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the price demanded by human smugglers.
Pjongjang hasn't made a public comment yet.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the major denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, Mr Ri Jong-ho, the North Korean Foreign Minister, attributed the sanctions to the US, to a standstill since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Mr Ri said in a address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority head of Nancy Pelosi’s House of Representatives named Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court candidate “hysteric” and said that he was inherently unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosíva said this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of a woman as if she were acting like a ‘hysteric’,” Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s commission of inquiry commented on Pelosi.
Kavanaugh bitterly denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and discussing his family and high school years of strangulation.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and referred the charges against himself to be "grew and coordinated defamation", organised by liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosíva said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be named supreme judge because it had shown that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe that by such statements and the way Clinton and the Democrats went, he has been discredited," she said.
Pelosíva is asked if she will try to make a constitutional accusation against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the Democrats will get the majority in the House of Representatives, she will become a member of the House of Representatives for a moment.
"I will say this – if Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosíva said that as a Democrat she was concerned by Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Law on Available Health Care or the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would have overturned certain rulings of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say ‘Isn’t that wonderful?” Pelosíva said.
And a woman's gotta get his ass kicked.
It's a righteous fallout after months and years of anger spilling, and he can't express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs Stein told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a director somewhere who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which was when she got angry and started crying, and she said to the person she was talking to, ‘I think you’re sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.’
And then she just kept going.
This seemed to me to be great."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful early - career memories, when I was still working in a man - dominated office, where I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, was when an elderly woman — a cold leader — grabbed me by my neck — who was always a bit afraid to drag me down to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They will think you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a boat named Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for herself.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the game, and another one was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone then named the game “Snow White and seven sticks”.
As the campaign was last joined, it was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who had given men $1,000, had given her only $250.
“Do they think I will get a discount?” she wondered.
When she informed her that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — her gratitude to the people who supported her, her dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and her anger at sexism — so overcame her as to start suffocating.
“We would think I have a nervous breakdown,” Mrs Schroeder recalled media reactions.
“They would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“Was she crying?”
How the war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial salami of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle has not been over for a long time, experts say that a split between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, triggered the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxation of key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which effectively means taxation of half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been compensated each time with equivalent reimbursement measures, lastly with tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent per US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed to moving an eye for the United States and will probably not be able to blink soon.
In order to allow Washington to give in, China should agree to its demands, but the public expulsion of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knew how to make the right move, US pressure in the long-term trade war could have a positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a specialist working in Asia at the New American Security Centre brain trust.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, a true foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of the country devastated in more than seven years by the ongoing war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All conditions are now met for refugees to return voluntarily to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated state.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries which sponsored the rebels.
Europe Wins Victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
With a victory against the US team, the team scored 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris in France won the Ryder Cup for 2018.
The US has now lost six in a row on European soil, and Ryder's Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when a team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, hit the water at 16th hole in the par-3 game at his initial shot, making it necessary to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been shining through all circles and has become one of the four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the current form of 1979 achieved the score of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth won the lowest ranking European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup the last time.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the best European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t normally cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year this year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he picked me up and believed in me.
So happy, so happy, we won the Cup again.
It is a team and I am really glad to be able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The baton is handing over to cousin John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. As I grew up, I watched his games,” said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four games to him in France, and now he has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 major titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the entire championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the U.S. captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, and I'm gonna be working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Poop down.
They played us."
