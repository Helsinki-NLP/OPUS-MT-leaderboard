Inflation in Europe jumped over food
Rapid inflation in the euro area is mainly due to a steady rise in food prices.
The November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October annual inflation was recorded 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast only assumed 3 percent, the Bloomberg agency said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing the price of raw materials and falling unemployment, together with rising inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation has to "do away" so that it does not have to do anything later on.
In Germany, November inflation stands at 3.3 percent of the 15-year record, and in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to rising food and energy prices.
Wheat prices have risen 88 percent, and soybean has also reached the highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets this year rose by 52 percent, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise in 2008 from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it has already fallen to 1.9.
According to analysts, 12 months of inflation will remain at around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup Sees a Government Crisis
Fideš's group of supporters has increased significantly by the beginning of December after a prolonged stagnation, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never found such low - 13 per cent support.
In the case of certain voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support compared to a five-point support of the ICHR.
According to the survey, the IMF and the SWDZ are below the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support for the whole population is two percent.
Among certain party voters, there are one percent more supporters of both camps.
Even with the previous minima, the public's perception of the economy has worsened - there has never been an ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high as 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families value changing their material situation after spring and summer prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for next year, the majority of the population with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those questioned were judged, most of which is the previous Gallup Institute’s research that the prime minister is doing his job more badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or believes very much 13 percent of those questioned, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe in 54%, Fidesh's movement 27 percent.
One indicator of political development is how a large part of the public believes that discontent with the prime minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While last year's October riots saw government and prime minister as demanding 35 percent, the share is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the drafting of new elections.
For interest in a referendum, 60 percent of those questioned responded to a question about their possible participation, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
In comparison, "parliamentary elections organised this Sunday" would certainly only be attended by 55 per cent and another 15 per cent would consider their participation to be likely.
The school would say no 74, doctor fees 79 and hospital charges 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the range of people who certainly promise to participate, the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital stays would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly a fifth hit by Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budaörsian trade triangle preserved last year, on average 16% of the price level growth with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of the journal Napi Gadzaság
The usual Christmas basket of Napi Gadzaság daily in the Budaörsian trade triangle grew by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets there was a price increase of up to a thousand forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets "spoiled" last December, there was not, as a result of the earlier high base, such a drastic betrayal.
However, it is certainly disappointing for consumers that what they were able to buy at the price of nine thousand forints last year will not now be worth ten thousand.
The daily economy consumer basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price for the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumer basket of 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but very much influenced by cruel breasts, nuts and poppy as well.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded with the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilo of bread for 139 forints.
The competition didn't go below 200 forints.
Similarly, in this store it was surprising that Coca Coly's two-litre price in the rear bottle was below 200 forints, so only 257 forints were made in advance.
However, this year it appeared according to the consumer basket Napi Gadazág Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, she raised prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gaddaság due to prices for Christmas Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest consumption basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest was 21 percent.
There was an increase of 1,480 in forints.
The average increase in prices last year resulted in 1,206 forints, with prices being influenced by VAT growth last year.
This is the process that the trade has reversed, the commercial houses clearly could not decide how large price ranges are to be determined for the individual products, since they could not predict the impact of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product concerned poorly, due to the price range adjusted to the volume of circulation, it may lose significant profit.)
Due to VAT, the increase in the price of the consumer basket of Napi Bossazág was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest was the price difference of 844 forints.
This year's extreme difference did not show up, the most expensive basket now stood by 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest impaled by 1,284 forints.
When both seasons were compared, there was a catastrophic price increase, and in less than 20 months, daily consumption in hypermarkets was more than 30 percent.
(This, inter alia, does not fully confirm the Central Statistical Office's data: this has been measured in the case of several basic foodstuffs a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumption basket of the daily economy, it seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, has shown, on the basis of the basic and worst-case scenario, price growth is barely 10 per cent.
The flour suppliers seem to have taken a stronger position than egg suppliers, and a drastic price increase has also been possible in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a gold triangle don't complain, they still report on a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in three visited shops no longer care about prices.
They buy everything, they buy the quantum, they take the long-term food on the payroll.
In the middle of the morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the cashiers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, the turnover is lower in the countryside, many international chains complain to research firms that the markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it saves on disinfectants
More than a thousand cases of infection were reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overload of disease control personnel do not help, according to the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria were found in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria present in his body, one important operation could not be performed either.
By this year's 10th December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant causes of disease were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Survey, said Karolina Böröczová, head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease originators have been registered in hospitals with certainty, and others are unknown.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacyline by a resistant golden staphyloccal.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. convulsion, mandle inflammation, skin infection, injured infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive degree or inappropriately, it develops from a bacteria that responds well to the antibiotic bacteria, which is highly resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in case of transient or permanent maladministration of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients of years of age, serious hospital infection, such as injury or blood poisoning - sepsis, may cause.
According to the Chief Medical Officer of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, a similar infection in hospitals is a daily practice.
"Infection must not be confused with epidemics, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of disease is not investigated."
Resisting Antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and in masks and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but neither can the infection always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in the home hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and spread of multi-resistant disease originators, Karolina Böröczová claims.
Since this infection occurs figuratively in hospitals and senior homes, hospitals should monitor the admitted patients and the carriers of MRSA should be isolated immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It is also important that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most cases have been detected if the patient is suffering from an apparent MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological testing should be carried out in order to prevent resistance to medication, but hospitals do not in all cases observe it.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare in the basic, and in the case of outpatient treatment, Karolina Böröczová reported.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most frequently through medical personnel.
Therefore, the role of handwashing and wearing gloves and masks is very important, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by febrile infection and by touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also find that in hospitals in an unfavourable material situation they save on disinfectants, nurses are few and patients are much more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are respected, similar infections can be shown to be less or further spread of the disease originator can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expenditure for health insurance companies, so it fights everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a programme to prevent MRSA, and to reduce it.
According to published data, the program seems to be successful with MRSA infection in England, a decreasing trend.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resident originators of diseases (including MRSA), and of hospital infections caused by these originants among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident wasn't drunk.
The official expert review in the case of police captain XXII, which caused the fatal accident, is completed.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of XXII, who on Tuesday killed a walker and who, in the meantime, resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or swindling substances, informed the spokesman of the Supreme State Department of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after he had completed a thorough assessment of this case.
The expert assessment confirmed the initial investigation, which had already concluded that the former police captain had not eaten any alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
The then director of Police Directorate XXII of the district struck down on Tuesday at Lajose Kossutha Street in XXII. by his own personal car while turning away a five hundred-year-old man who had entered before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker has moved outside of the zebra, especially according to traffic rules is not an extenuating circumstance, the turning-off car must still give priority.)
After the transfer to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the District Police Director resigned from office and requested the transfer to service, according to the police report, because the case was so shaken up.
In the case, the Budapest Investigation Authority is investigating.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with state agents conducting investigations from the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The three credit framework agreements totalling EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, were signed by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and the environment projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, with a value of EUR 300 million, while the parties had already entered into a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the now signed contract relates to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A EUR 150 million loan agreement is also used for budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which the budget will mainly use for the research and development project of the University of Debrecín.
There was also a talk at the meeting about the 4th metro route.
The Parties agreed that once Hungary has agreed on the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to János Veres, this may occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed €8.4 billion in total 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest paid by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise for the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys for the time being the cheapest but fast-tracking EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European property purchase goal is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are most in the course of the region Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the coast of the sea then Albena, Golden sands, Sunny coast, the ancient city of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for property in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, investors as well as the central part of the country will be interested sooner or later - for example Veliki Tarnov, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested also buys in the vicinity of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital city of Sofia is also a promise of tempting opportunities, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to change into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, becoming next to the summer and winter seasons that have been sought for travel in the next two seasons.
Predictable investors are already shopping in large areas, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but also customers from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, at the Black Sea and in ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
The foreign buyer is to be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settling people buy either a renovated property worth between 50 and 100,000 euros, or a meticulous old house for 5-15 thousand euros, which then rebuilds.
They require good availability and communication options, and it is important for them to be close to a large city, shop, and usually a local doctor.
The second categories are chat buyers (Bulgaria is among the first 10 German recreational destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hopes of rising values in the medium- or long-term horizon.
Disposal of properties in the capital is uninterrupted, as demand is increasingly strong.
Although the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, over the last five years they have grown 21 percent annually.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to information from the Minister of Environment and Water Management, Gabor Fodor's meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday, and after the mid-term official start of the International Climate Management Conference will continue after 2012 with the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are dealing with the Bali Roadmap, which resolves the next effort after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol, which will be valid until 2012.
At the moment, they are being debated violently between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not now choose to deal with exact numbers, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 due to the state of 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will join, in addition to reducing emissions, in providing both material and technological assistance to the countries affected.
The agreement was also born on subsidies to developing countries.
The subsidy fund provided for by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by the 16-member governing board, most likely under the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in Piac es Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Environment and Water Minister Gabor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to play a leading role in the global climate protection effort and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU undertakes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2020, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the 'Agreement after 2012' agreement, and is ready to commit itself to a 30 per cent reduction in the event that other developed areas of the world, as well as the developed countries, are willing to accept the responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 have set the target of 5.2 per cent reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. - is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali it is a lot, as an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would not go as far as 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol's climate change commitments would not immediately be subject to a new system of reduction of emissions, the need of which has also been highlighted in its latest report by the UN International Scientific Council on Climate Change - the IPCC, which bears the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in lowering emissions and an inevitable increase in average Earth temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which according to scientists would have an extremely serious and irreversible effect.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish on the server for sharing video recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which make themselves popular.
First, YouTube liked British Air Force (RAF): Since March 2006, the BBC has been recording videos of actions against the Taliban.
Recordings obtained by a miniature camera attached to the helmet shall be controlled by the air force commanders of the Kandahar fighting operation and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 British air force soldiers have been recorded online and more than 75,000 people have looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Establishment in Afghanistan
Air forces have released videos according to their original intention to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to familiarize the general public with the real objective of the presence of an army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form against traditional television recruitment advertisements is almost useless," said BBC Defence Specialist Gordon Mackenzie, "but there is also a political message in it, because it is a special form of validation of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans have made the game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a bit of covert, "official" propaganda films, the officers talk most about losses, but there is no bloody form of struggle.
In fact, many videos of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been obtained on the Internet, which was created during a sharp deployment, but the British army has come upon them right now.
The Americans carry out the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffle and pogs
The Minister of Labour Mónica Lamperthová is obviously not sentimental: he will hold a final meeting for his colleagues, where he will say goodbye to the Pagans and coffee with the year 2007.
Some ministries will celebrate with live music, while others will seduce officials of the Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the mighty have fun.
State authorities are preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will organise the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but it does not expect its employees to do so.
On Christmas Orphans will receive gifts to children of fallen soldiers, during the Mission's Christmas feasts family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but will also arrange reception for journalists.
The resort focuses on the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the hooves against other departments.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints, and about three hundred employees of the ministry are expected to attend.
The resort will hold on to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will be various performances and also a raffle will be played.
Christmas NFÜ stood 4 700 000 forints and held concerts and dinners on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building.
There was a million forints to rent the hall, and the rest was built on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: there will be a company providing for the movement of tenderes, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vigszynház Theatre.
MAG a. s. failed to confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
There's no need for a suit.
The OIT building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the St. Lucia dance on December 7th instead of Christmas.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The dinner started with a health minister, and after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the dance, there were no compulsory evening dress or suit.
Puritan party is about to be attended by health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth's co-workers don't even officially go to a Christmas party, but to a final work meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests count, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pogs, so only 350 000 forints will be available for the party.
Minister of Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will join his colleagues in the ministry of local self-government and regional development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, at which 436 workers are expected, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party is 2 500 forints per guest - the total includes reception with buffet tables and toast.
Since Minister János Veres, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, and the officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time.
The department of agriculture organizes the New Year's reception on January 20th, and the ministerial holidays do not take place.
The reception takes place in the Vajdahunyadvár castle in the City Gardens and according to the Ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short health minister and end with a small hospitality.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the portal [origo] said the relevant press department.
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the Environment Department in the Press Department was not shared.
In any event, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Arts.
Turning to a giant strike
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, as well as the International Trade Union (ILO) will set up its strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday there will be a protest public meeting, Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work will be stopped.
The action will certainly result in a serious interruption of transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, they will meet the League Association together with the International Union of Working Councils with the details of a jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's event.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, and as of Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the termination of the strike, which begins on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not eventually adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike challenge.
However, if the legislation is voted off, the strike boards will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to Parliament's meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted on until late evenings, if any, at night.
Due to the start-up strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: the railway will be stopped indefinitely, and part of Budapest public transport and more than half of Volán can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, it will also take place in many parts of the country to close half the road.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the call to the strike, whose list is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organisations have scheduled a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared temporary stoppages.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, and at the beginning of Christmas holidays more and more people are traveling along the railway.
According to previous reports, from the beginning of operation up to 13 hours will strike BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Union of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, to 2-, respectively 2-8 hours' stoppage of work called for by the Committee Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a reform of health insurance and submit a new concept to the public debate.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from next year.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010 is provided for early retirement for the relevant employment areas.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZZ), which falls under the League's trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungary's Guard Increases Country Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért movement in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital Institute increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several ways.
The "warning of risks" of the company is written: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that "to focus on the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Roma peoples of Hungary, there can be violent ethnic clashes in a short time".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action - the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest concerns of the Hungarian political leaders: "the public debate on the Roma issue has been left to the representatives of the public life of radical and extremist political groups who were able to put a political strategy on the Roma-Madarian issue."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute judges.
Moreover, the Hungarian Guard's activities according to the research institute have had a great impact on domestic and foreign media "to a large extent, Hungary's image in the country's stability and democratic prosperity, particularly as regards belief in the country".
The Institute recalls: it has been part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-rightist groups, which have been becoming more and more popular since autumn 2006, that since the summer of 2007 a number of organizations have been created in Hungary, which themselves have been referred to as "national domestics" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as citizens' associations, while they openly report - even armed - the willingness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of living disasters, invasion of property, disturbance of order), in addition with an indication of the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes: all of this is happening in a way that tries to wrap up a variety of political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and the parties to civilian clothes.
Thus, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups is not only used to avoid legal scaffolds of judicial registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an increasing risk factor from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months they point to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to excuse their own anti- Hungary policy by appealing to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The Hungarian Guard’s activities are similar, for example, to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-righter Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is based on mass Romani unrest, which erupted in one of Sofia’s districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used this BNU to establish a guard, with the organisation's goal being a "national home defense".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there was a "Cycan terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent, reminding the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative sparked a heated discussion by the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is signalled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they are creating their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own defences, we can be informed of the risks drawn up by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of the Political Capital Institute, reported on a press question: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds something that might affect the change of risk, public opinion shall be informed, as in this case by issuing risk warnings.
Holidays are not available everywhere
In Hungary, the days of leave are precisely laid down by law and it has become common practice that the working days move around the holidays, which is less than the next year.
In the European Union or in America, holidays are not united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Workdays are usually related to church holidays or to important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free - for the New Year already so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
On March 15th, celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and 23rd October, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, on November 1st and 2nd we remember dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely happen on weekends, it has become a practice to move on the working day in cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price for the extended weekend, of course, is that we stay in the workplace and in school before Saturdays.
When the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is over, we work out, for many years in a special decree, by the Minister of Labour.
The legal provision applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and to public servants.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in the light of their determination even during working days.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around Christmases at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will be almost halted, as according to previous experience, most people spend days between Christmas and Sylvester 'work' or thus will use a saved holiday.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle of the week, with respect to the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will change around the holiday work so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
Another shift has to do with the 23rd of October: Saturday, 18th October, will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, the next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, since they will have almost all the time since 24 December even though Sylvester is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things that you can piss off your colleagues with.
E-mails that we forget to send out, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice anymore: all of this "serves" everyday days in the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences or put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
Is that why you missed the party?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to deliver (this is a less common solution).
The most often thing is solved by one apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about what you might do to your colleagues to prepare for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than stretching for writing, office needs or for your phone, and they're not there.
Remember yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table one of your colleagues your pen that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll have a right to be mad at you for picking on their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or sticky papers out of your office, because it may be awkward when they arrive early, and you will need them immediately.
Talk about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stopping the spreading gossip.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone on the nose about your peers' private life!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and appeal for a severe headache, you will report your absence because you are not well, or if you think that you would rather rest today, think of your work, immediate tasks and work with which you have a certain deadline, someone else will have to do for you.
Pay attention to your colleagues!
If you know that you are not going to work the next day, or that something may happen that you will have to stay at home, please announce that your colleagues and the leaders are not confronted with your absence until the second day.
Dive, hysteria, telephone
Did you go to work to get your hygienist kicked out of?
Do you want to witness a phone conversation that you don't want to hear at all?
Don't interrupt your co-workers by conspiring, singing, loud talk (over their heads) or by kicking, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disturbing even when they are not currently involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
You're blaming the second person for his mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't respond to any chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you were mistaken and someone has paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you could put things right, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Clothing and slippers: comfortable at home, however, not suitable in the office!
Don't wear your clothing for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming into the office in regular clothes - and if that's what your profession requires, nice and elegant!
When you want to fit, you stop being interesting.
Driving in a normal morning jam.
A special tune will be heard from the radio: the sound of violins to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace, and bass is added to previous tones, and a female congregation joins as a real jewel.
At the m2 station, Zagar's composition is called Wings of Love.
For a long time, home music has not just spoiled us with a high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the traffic seems a little different, because you're listening to Zagar's new album.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from home digital underground, the overall image slowly changes, and although it is once again in fashion the garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Five-Style and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two dudes don't go into one spell - he gave up his own way.
But with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he started to crack until he was called to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Film by Ference Török "Sezon").
Its formation, played in the beginnings of smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience after the van2 magazine included their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important homeboards and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic operators determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on the course", although of course no one has asked them if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as it belonged: she made a new, better album.
Now released an album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the name itself tries to create continuity with the initial flights in the Five Churches.
This is a poem from the composition of the old Balázz Zságer band there.
The reference to etherically, flying would be on the spot, but next to the etheric breath of this music appeared - in line with the spirit, trend of time - louder guitar, influence rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligetti, who currently works in England with The Puzzle, introduced himself to the premiere of the records in Millenaires Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which has been playing since the morning until the evening of popular music, we began to catch a stirring tune of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's fine?
The portal hvg.hu told Baláz Zsager.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how long does what you play remain, extreme music?
Balázs Zsager: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, it also works, as it is accepted, independently of language and state boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: Foreign music, especially from us to the west, has a lighter music of greater tradition.
There, not only teenagers and people go to concerts after 20, but also older ones.
Many more observe the changes of light music going on around them, as they also consider it part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and how much?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we've never done music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather than at concerts where the influence already works, but it hides itself only in impregnable changes of the moment.
Still, I have noticed that when a person wants to meet an audience, he has stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works solo, and he built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
Rather, we are team players who rely on the music of the other and leave it to develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid our work being compared to Yonderboi’s compositions, for some of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the toplist station mr2 Petőfi the song Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you consciously opened yourself to wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn't plan on writing a hit to sell the board.
There's more to that song.
We thought of it as the finals of the album that we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it just - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The play was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of making this choir of soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six - i.e. Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judi Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodos [Neo], Yuci Niemeth - which we then baptized on Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly what you were thinking, or did the girls make something out of it?
B.Zs.: The composition had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the board came together, we thought there was something else needed for this composition.
The chord sequence was meant to be joined by a singing party.
That day at night, I sang to him a melody that the girls later learned.
It all worked out almost for the first time and terribly spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took Divya.
My voice wouldn't work like that.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing all together, and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't support their singing.
They also stood in the back stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The standing behind was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share solo roles is, on the contrary, deliberate.
And the song is to forget a little about our ego, where we are from, where it belongs, and just to let those wings rise, the wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born others would feel.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Z.: During the composition of the music with not one, the heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he long didn't want to function groovy, then he slowly found his place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new board is your favorite?
B.Z.: This keeps changing by the concerting and the fact that I've already released the board.
Now it's the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Traitor broker risked billions of inadequacies
A prodigious defrudant.
That's how Jeroma Kerviel's famous employee, the French banking giant Société Genérale, owns the domestic commercial bank.
Because of him, she lost nearly five billion euros.
But it seems more like Kerville was just a big player who wanted to get back together with his colleagues, and he was definitely incompetent.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized the US mortgage crisis at times.
"He is mentally weaker," sounded from his superiors, who sent him to the police.
However, according to Kervielo’s statement by the French media, such as Le Monde, it was a person who, at the end of last year, had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his stores.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," the statement said.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros during the American crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payment, would have problems.
But it did not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerville didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profits climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"For the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerville admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
He admits, throughout the interrogation, that he faked the records so that they wouldn't find him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though he began to care about his business in the Eurex Stock Exchange.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come after him?
I don't think so.
"I thought just the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take that kind of risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerville told investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
Allianz's stock earned him half a billion euros in bombings against London.
And that was a trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you go.
"It's like a snow globe," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, or rather they knew.
"When I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
He was trying to clean it up after the weekend in mid-January.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that it cost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I only picked four days in the last year.
The broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone to keep an eye on his records," Kerville concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go into transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in its current use of EU funds.
Twenty-year sentence for the president of Nicaragua confirmed the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year sentence for the former president of Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced for financial fraud of $100 million (at least 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his hacienda near Nicaragua’s metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state is to return from 1997 to 2002, it is not clear from AP.
According to the President-in-Office of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will now depend on prison factors whether they let Alemán serve his sentence at home or whether he is in prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that it regularly transferred government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Aleman founded to fund his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget unique?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and by the accepted coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year, he passed with the support of ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford his non-reception.
Unlike the heated debate before voting on the government's mistrust, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The House of Representatives has traditionally been overlooked, although the most influential, the law has peacefully approved.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is a major part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the government's powerful rivalry with the opposition.
It is more grateful to the media, and that is why much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The question of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the strict figures.
The state budgets in the past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three infirmities which it is unable to resolve in 2008 at once:
The first is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandate expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalice" of ČSSD and KSČM prior to the elections last year.
The other is the deficit economy as a result of the First Inspiration.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. city and municipality budget deficits.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is a deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, apart from taxes, fees and loans from banks, have obtained additional resources for investments, often without a head restraint to issue bonds that they unduly owed to their councillors.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by selling massive shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the state in privatisation.
Now they don't have this source anymore.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, the growth phase, which is constantly bragging about the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our republic.
It's a huge disgrace that falls primarily on the governments of the past.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, at least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have just been wasted on giant proportions.
Although some of the unreasonable populist expenditure approved before the elections this year has been abolished, so if there is not in the near future a shift to retirement and pension reform, then any policy in this country will actually end and whoever rules will be a mere office.
With little oversupply, it can be said that government politicians become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the imposition of normal expenditure by mandate.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the past governments had not managed in the last ten years as much as they could.
If we don't really want to see government politicians become the most effective officials, then we have to be patient and give our support to this uncompromising coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only by allowing the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight the crisis in the financial markets.
There's more than a hundred billion dollars in foreign exchange markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank auctions an interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and another twenty-four will make European and Swiss central banks available.
This is the first time that the central banks of individual States have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis after the 11 September attacks.
"This step is to address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group advisory company in his report.
"Coordinated action by central banks reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion more losses.
"The central banks must really fear what else can follow when they have decided to do so," said the main economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also encourage their customers to borrow.
This would reduce consumption and send America's economy into recession with possible impacts on the world's economic growth.
The central banks thus decided not to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London Interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, even though US, Canadian and British central banks had reduced interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that a step by the central banks will contribute to the blessing of the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of Ecologists Are Incredible
Global climate change is most likely to affect developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now resigned to the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not the green planet, he said that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which forms a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organisations, but it also makes a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that guides it and the reality.
"Debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so involved.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I sometimes only encounter cartoons of my opinions".
Now, then, the applicants can read his unbreakable views.
Klaus pointed out that he was not a climateologist, but he felt that he had sufficient grounds for writing such a book.
He is an academic who is able to monitor and assess professional procedures, has experience in statistics and is also a national economy.
As the main conclusions of the book indicate that climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore pose no threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which feels like a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militaristic environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driver’s license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to be issued by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year’s time, hundreds of thousands of drivers would be on the road without valid authorisation.
According to the authorities, they didn't change their license, especially those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis have collapsed and the interest in the exchange of licence has increased this week.
The Magistrate serves about 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the front.
In Prague, the driver's license did not change around 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it may be requested to issue within a reduced period of five days.
In that case, the driver will charge five hundred crowns.
The penalty will be imposed on motorists who will not be able to make it to the end of the year without a valid driver’s license.
The culprit will pay up to 2,000 crowns.
But a policeman can also deal with an offence through an agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, he could have received a fine from the town hall and a man who would not go anywhere.
An estimated 30,000 crowns could be paid.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose a maximum of 1 000koron fines.
According to the Department of State for Transport of Karl Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines don't threaten anyone.
The driver’s license is according to him a proof that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil identity card that everyone has to have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is only to be taken or sent by mail to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, they will cease to pay for the licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
Motorists, however, need to exchange other types of driving licenses gradually.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdich
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konjárík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdich's gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years, decided to do so.
Initially, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee to fight organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
Only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible against today's decision.
Although he is also accused in this case, Berdich is waiting for the first-instant verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received fines of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of robbery to be involved, and today 16 of them were tried by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants have been refusing to pursue a built-up cause since the start of the investigation.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, by agreement, inter alia, with Birdych, transmitted information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Koňárík.
In the prosecution, it is the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, burglaries, whose victims have often suffered serious injury to health, but also abuses of public authority and illicit arms.
The police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core shots, a laser targeting machine gun, or a rifle.
According to the charges, the gang has come with robberies for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, courts have already found guilty of other robberies of Berdich and a number of other people.
Other men from the vicinity of Berdicha have yet to testify before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulejov, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a definitive decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.

In exchange for children in the maternity ward, Igor Veleb's injured family lawyer after the Tribe hospital wants to compensate 12 million crowns, plus court charges.
For each mother for three million, for the father for two million and for the children for a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
The legal representative of Ondřej Hospital therefore disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a demand, it is very high," the Enough said after today's meeting.
"But in order for us to have an opinion on the counter proposal, we need a well-known judgement which the opposing party has drawn up.
Let's see if it has any matching value.
But we persist in the view that it will be in statisticians for all," the Enough stressed.
According to him, the amount should range from CZK 100,000 to CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the Jablonów family wanted a million crowns each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiations on the compensation of a well-known judgement prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they had to deal with feelings that the replacements of newborns had not been prevented.
Again, women are worse aligned with the current trauma, and with what's happening right now, he's summed up Veleb's content.
Veronica and Nikola switched nurses in the Tribe family last December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákov to Pribyslavic and Veronika to Libor Broža and Jaroslav Trojanová to Jablonová.
Hajtman Vysočina Miloš sent each of the families 100,000 crowns at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by the failure of the Tribe hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In case of doubt, they must reach out to the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the assistance of the originator.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation to people, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup lost the Valaš Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Valaš.
According to the judge of the Istrian Regional Court, for the first time he used the marking of the king of Warsaw, but the project built a long-standing team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The soup did not participate today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client cancels.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasites in the popularity of Bolka Polivka," the lawyer said after Polivk's trial.
In his opinion, in the words of the kingdom of Valash, all of them will have their share of actors and comedians.
Harabish has the same opinion.
"There's almost a decade of work behind us.
Seeking money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have some of it.
They want to parasite on our work," he added.
Lukative business
According to the court's designation, the king of Warsaw first used Polivka on his television show.
In 1993 it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brębohatý.
But at that time it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of issuing Waalish passports.
From the original recession action, trade and lucrative business activities were excluded, and Harabiš then established the company of the Kingdom of Valaš.
In 1997 Polivka agreed to mention his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also said that Harabis had only used the bare idea that Polivka had published in the manifesto for his business purpose.
"Popularity of the Boleslav Polivka project of the Valaš Kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabis and his team, who devoted themselves to him.
Today, the cooperation of the defrauded parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized the official coronation of the Holy Land for Polivka.
Since then, however, disputes have begun between Polivka and Harabis, culminating in the meeting of the "King of Boleslav I, elected for fur".
The leading role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed an action against Harabishi and his company, which the court rejected today.
It could clearly bring Harabis a premeditated curse on the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and deadline have not yet been released.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like riding kings on Slovakia.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polivka can sign up easily," added Harabiš.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing Prejudice
In fact, I've never been too fond of Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not too much, the quality of sorting, driving and also production could be described as being below average.
But the market is now the successor to Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
And the van called SW is still a bit further away and I'm not left to think about.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my backseat.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the van's body means they won't have two meters long in this direction.
The Flight of the World
I'm going to move very quickly so I don't repeat myself very much.
It's a pretty well-mannered design, where I have the only clue for a poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design inventory here, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or braces.
The side lines also improved significantly against model 206.
As for space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of bodywork.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of a place above the head disappears.
Bagcases
That's what's important about this car. It's his business.
I have to think of this as a very well accessible one (and also thanks to an empty back window) and as a well-congregated one.
The deaf places are equipped with restraint tires, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't prevent, it can stretch, and it keeps even harder objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic 428 l arrangement, which is rather an average value against competition.
But not against the most sold car of this class in the Czech Republic - Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the mláboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging by a lot of significant 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I were to pick up the positives, I still have to mention a flat floor after folding the second row or very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a firing four-roller of 1.6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old should look like who drives a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's low on consumption, and she's pulling.
If I compare it to a harmful pattern that acts as if it had a stuffed cloth in the exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
Price list indicates
The price of a car is not human.
However, we must bear in mind that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a hot 14-year-old for 329 900 CZK will still be fine.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410 900, which is quite enough.
Tested Premium equipment will then add equipment for another 80,000 CZK top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic triggering of wipers, electric rear windows control...
Just a car costs everything around 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the additional features at Fabia and you'll come up with a very similar number.
So it's not until we decide on the mark.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
Children from Eastern Europe arrive in British schools, which raises concerns for local residents about further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original population are escalating into violence.
The problem with the integration of Eastern European children in British schools illustrates the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants begin to escalate.
The fights, bullying and fights between pupils have also moved into parent-to-parent relationships.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police detained a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with iron bars.
The guilty woman is defending herself from being insulted by racist moles.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The women of men allegedly celebrated racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed to a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he turned on us apples and pears, and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
Complaints are on both sides.
One local settler even described disputes with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrant communities is beginning to become tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain, who were sent here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, offering pizza on the beach, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On islands in the Caribbean you will find it in a full and even richer amount.
There's only one island, but you'll find much more, and Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles, is the island.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the garden of their conquest of America.
Columbus named her the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure translator that the Spanish in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional grew at the end of 20 years.
He let him build one of the American mob leaders, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibition), was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were my guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew up, and after extensive boulevards, cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century were used.
Ernest Hemingway bought his estate in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and Coyjamar had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Media, they left their signatures to showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they will mix you a cocktail as you wish.
And the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana so far, because once imported gigels and fiats in the salt and wet air have rotted long ago.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is very clever, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere around as there is.
Other places also turn into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libosta, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated by its riders in particular.
Three of the vast plantations were bound to sugar-trucks after narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, and so there are functioning machines, whose lawns are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not pass.
And so it's Varader, or Havana, that doesn't have to be a big deal.
I just hope to remind you that in Hemingway's already mentioned estate there is a museum and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
Viñales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vínáles Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the calcium floor.
The mogities, limestone homoli and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soils are caught in their hollows, which also makes the outer rock covered with dense growth.
The valley is the place where perhaps the most quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final appearance if you visit any of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone might find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean work was spinning there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a slave trade and sugar.
Riches have become the beauty and display of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has almost remained unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and Mount Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that region to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking also at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón beach, or the Cukrovar Valley.
In the evening, you should go to Casa de la Música, who lives after dark, and the music in it flows over the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to the town in the eastern part of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely, such an opinion affects the way itself.
Both roads, which lead there from Guantánama, must overcome the high and divided mountains and pass through the nature that human activity has hardly seen.
The eastern island of Cuba was written by UNESCO because of its unbroken nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact it was about a hundred years after Columbus) and from the hill where the former castle stands, and today's El Castillo Hotel, you can see several table mountains, most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra mountain, about the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the tropican cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patronage Caridad del Cobra, about the santeria, and the African religions that claim the descendants of former slaves, many pages could be described.
But, as they say, it's better to see.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment is affecting the United States' mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should plan a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to the idea, in Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries holding units in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are currently discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, has called on NATO units to become more active, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the inhabitants to start their own further development of the economy and security," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. Army, the activity of Afghan insurgents has been the highest in five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 percent last year, even 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the very limit in the organisation and equipment of the units.
In particular, they require additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about specific goals for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy about what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," Reuters De Hoop told Japanese government in Tokyo at the end of their class interviews.
Who Is Passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about the maximum number of all allies in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are set up in areas where there is a minimum of violence and combat claims are not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard Sun this week has identified German soldiers as sloths.
"Afghan hunters discovered: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild went to the counterattack and printed a shot of a British unit during a football match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will drop by 1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a sovereign debt of more than 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better developments in state budget management.
The Czech Republic's state debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it has increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today confirmed its state debt data from early October.
Each Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could not overcome the limit of the trillion crown until 2009.
Next year, debt should go between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," analyst Patria Finance David Marek told the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimír Picora sees this: "To exceed one trillion we could reach during 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be more willing to save, it could move to 2010.
But I don't suppose that change," he said.
Debts grow
The state debt consists of central government debts and is mainly due to the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The state debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state so far increased by 38.5 billion this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called commercial government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average debt repayment increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarter, which is really a lot of how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, growth is mainly generated in bonds, with an increase of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will deal with what when there is pension reform," Pikoro said.
Better than expected.
The State Debt Financing and Management Strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to a better development of state budget management.
The amount consists mainly of the government budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, it is the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidating agency 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion pension reserve, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is scheduled to come to court in Chartúm today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher, tried in Sudan for insult to Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Chartum tribunal on Thursday night and released, according to her lawyer.
Britain was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils give Muhammad the ply bear despite the fact that any portrayal of the Prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was subjected to a whip wound.
This four-year-old British teacher, working at the Unity High School in Sudan Chartúm, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after several students' parents filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class ply bear.
"From the mouth of the children there will be eight names, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says Robert Boulos, director of the school.
After voting in the class, 20 out of 23 children will eventually be chosen as the most popular name Mohamed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all in Sudan it is a very extended name.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label on it, but it is in itself a picture of a prophet considered an insult to Islam.
A fellow Muslim Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that she knew her well and that she would never do anything offensive to any religious belief: "I regret only that she asked the children to vote for some name," he said, "it is only "an innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "they never talk about religion in the class".
Recall that the baptismal name Mohamed is also the second most frequently given baptismal name in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This baptismal name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of honoring the prophet (often granted to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of that name?
Is it possible, for example, to give toys?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and last round of talks in the Austrian Baden on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome the different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations were over.
"We do not expect violence at the near future, but we are entering into a difficult period", he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense".
The negotiations end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian speaking populations, could be shown in a clearer light by December 10th when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko are to report their report to the UN Security Council.
Interviews in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, the Troika has entrusted with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans expect talks to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who had previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after the most specified deadline.
"Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu reported at the Baden Hotel, where this "last chance" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "there is a past that has led to murders and deportations".
"Dominal effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that the compromise still comes into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domestic effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But it does not mean to Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be subject solely to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto rights.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only solutions from the Security Council are acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This meeting took two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status will have the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking inhabitants, it would take place "in agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the start of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland called by its budding, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on the immediate commencement of negotiations with the intention to resolve once and for all 60 years the ongoing dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonial activities, declare Bush and recall the obligations that the two sides have assumed from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees exiled in the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbas took the words after the American President and stressed that the subsequent negotiations would be "whole and thorough" and to touch all aspects of the solution by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
Olmert then took part in the tribunal, which expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "need to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for his "vision of two states", a Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia announced that it had made a commitment since Bush in this sense before it had decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories for the 1967 wars, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "crossroads in Middle East history in particular because it fights the roots of conflict and its central aspects", according to Prince Saúd in an interview which he provided a single Arabic-speaking journal protected by Saudi capital.
According to the D.A., cops don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicles, the official version does not match what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection Generale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car traveled by Louise-Michel Street on Sunday shortly after 17:00 in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but it was on patrol and was speeding from 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not on," the police source explains.
The green motorcycle brand Kawasaki, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to ride on public communications" (read below), controlled by two young people without helmets, drove "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit a police car on the left side after giving priority to the right," one policeman said.
The blood alcohol pass test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (broken forearm, cracked windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the velocity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly yesterday morning and announced that IGPN had been responsible for investigating "acts of unintentional killing and not providing assistance to persons in danger", which is also addressed by the department departemente de la sêreté publicque du Val-d'Oise (the directorship of the regional police department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excluded, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
The three witnesses who were interviewed Sunday night confirmed, according to the office, "a version of the police officers, that the mini-motor had approached them relatively quickly on the left."
Some kind of rig, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the klipsen on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained incarcerated until the moment the police car could stop.
The vehicles have been secured, and they will undergo technical expertise.
Both victims were subjected to autopsy yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, in Williers-le-Bell, there was a rapid spread of talk about police leaving the crime scene quickly without providing two young people with first aid.
IGPN had, in all caution, also to rule out "any serious offence" at this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which to be very careful," said the police source.
The daily "Liiberation" met with an eyewitness of the few moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"We immediately ran down with a cousin who is a nurse at the hospital to try to resurrect them," the witness tells us.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "screeching, completely frightened cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone."
They appear in the face of rapidly increasing tension and the certainty that the situation of young people is hopeless, were police officers taken by car by colleagues who, meanwhile, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived 20 minutes after the police left.
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Don't let anyone claim that the police authorities didn't rush young people to help.
First aid was granted to these young people.
The firemen came immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Voltage in Pakistan is growing
Pakistani police suppressed Monday's first demonstration of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under an exceptional condition were injured by tear gas grenades that, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement forces.
The last names responded with stones, wounding several officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced a demonstration, following waves of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday morning by roadblocks to prevent meetings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Alliance of Muttahid Miles-e-Amal, whose president "provided the population to send flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional situation and the waste to those who made an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All that we are witnesses is illegal, constitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court," said the official in The News.
Parvíz Musharraf's promise to give up the leadership of the army and become the civilian president "not paying" after the establishment of an exceptional state, Tariq Azeem, Deputy Minister of Information, announced on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform until November 15th, when his first presidential mandate was terminated.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also reversed the ongoing speculation in the country, according to which the deputy chief of the army had to order President Musharraf to be imprisoned at home.
More than a third of pregnancy still creates unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected, it reveals studies conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographeriques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which has enacted contraceptives in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unexpected pregnancies.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the failure rate, estimates Ined.
The law of contraception only allowed better "fertility control", the Institute asserts, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten are well planned today.
One pair of five is even calculated for the month precisely and if possible in spring, which is considered the most enjoyable annual period for the birth of a child.
Amazing repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazinski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make remarkable repairs to the torn solar panel necessary for further scientific activities of the station.
It was a risky output into space that collected records in terms of duration, distance from the habitable modules, the speed at which it was planned and the rates of "creating" that astronauts spent on repair.
The troubles occurred on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship expounded the Harmony module, a large cylinder designed to install the European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing platform for modules lab.
But you have to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the 17-popultun power module using solar panels already located at the ISS to anchor at its final position.
After it was moved, the crew began to dismantle the 70-meter solar panels of the module.
And in that was one of the panels decomposing as a tractor harmonica, due to the plugging of the cable, damaged on the area almost one meter.
The decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to perform a checkout on the Discovery ship, and then go fix another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazinsky who was chosen to go flying to the end of the robotic shoulder of a ship attached to the station's shoulder and perform the repairs.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the American Aviation and Space Authority (NASA).
The tall, stable, very obtuse, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by a doctor to "oper" the "consumed" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and fastened to the damaged areas some kind of "wreaths".
He was assisted by the second "spacewalker", which remained near the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Wilson, the crew commander.
The tools that he used, the mini-goosette, with an insulating device, to prevent shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "cushical" created astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazinsky waited for the panel to be completely decomposed and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS stocks weaken
The EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange are losing significantly after the airline operating in the air and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of A400M.
The EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at €21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays arising from the slow progress in the development of the A400M A400M aircraft engine, which is the condition of the start-up flight.
The price for easing the delay in deliveries of a military cargo aircraft, reported in October, was "to EUR 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EDS constructor.
Due to these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to report a new profit outlook against interest and tax deductions (EBIT).
The group also announced that the new cost estimate would correspond with a six-month delay.
Let us recall that the production results of the EADS fell by 86 % in 2006 mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant aircraft A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French army would be provided in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without intense anticipation: the Russians will mostly elect President Putin's side, the United Russia.
Confirming that, after the very little free election campaign, its pursuit of stability, or authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the House of Representatives, Russian President Vladimír Putin will tell voters at the public service stations of a pre-recorded television message, whose content is kept secret.
This makes it the position of leader of the United Russia, the Procremel Party, who is likely to celebrate a devastating victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish to be honest, as far as possible the most transparent and open choices, elections without the slightest defect to beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not even close.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says "there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Jelcin".
After the repression of last weekend demonstrations, the former world champion at the Garry Kasparov chess, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer, continues to prohibit visits.
"Russia's still got the homo sovietica mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple, tense expectations, two more open questions are identified:
"Who becomes Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The official letter was published yesterday on the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may be represented by 23 December.
Vladimír Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But there is no follower.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia that chooses the government and president?
Whether it be one way or another, the outgoing ruling power wins all the parliamentary lines, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russia has remained a homo sovietica mentality, does not feel like being master of her destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notes a time-distant relationship: civil society has acquired, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has tied up with the state's pathological model, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than the fact that this new domesticism has not been accompanied by terror, but some economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "willfully surrender their personal responsibilities", which they showed shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (from a total of 85 Russian chiefs) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, like in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not elect extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Černichenko, four-and-a-half-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which account for the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are open to the public.
47 million archiving documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available until this time only for a "humanitarian" purpose, which means individually and nominally, upon request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the ratification process for all States is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitivity
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow you to explore "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of the forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, Director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, had been opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, for reasons of sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the presumptive homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation?
Registers of concentration camps or arrests established by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work subjected to civilian citizens, to bring them proof of their boarding with a view to opening the way for their compensation.
Today more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing new can be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, the EU foreign ministers gave the Green European Commission to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Southeast Asian States Association (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is overwhelmingly imposing on both economies" and "India is gaining better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giant will annually change "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" this week Danièle Smadja, Head of Delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, for the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.

The Bank of England took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England indicated on Thursday that it intends to ease its current concerns that the credit market conditions will deteriorate again and that the offer of £10 billion will be announced at a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, an unusually long offer.
"In an effort to ease concerns that the financial market conditions will be very negative at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way in which they can secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Communication reported.
The Bank points out that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on December 6th at 12.15 GMT until January 10th at the basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It normally takes a week.
The BOE adds in its communication that "he remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates" of interbank loans at the same level as his base rate.
The inter-bank inter-bank interest rate was on Wednesday at 5,829 %.
The three-month interest rate has been set at 6.6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, sums have been placed on the financial market by the Bank of England linked to the rates of taxation that have prevented banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the euro's library course, many have preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and better discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement population, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with proposals by Socialists (PS) on profitability
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the various paragraphs of the socialist proposal for a law on profitability, which is equal to rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill was received under the so-called socialist "boiler" (a meeting initiated by the Parliamentary Club) and contained dozens of measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including an increase of 50% of the employment premium, the renewal of TIPPs, transport cheques or rent regulation.
In view of the fact that the UMP and NC voted against the negotiations of the individual paragraphs (180), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television presentation on profitability.
The head of the PS Members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would once again submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to the amendment of the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A New Festival to Be Born
As a result of many speculations that the C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," told Charlie Jones of the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Wineland in New Jersey is a summer camp destination.
The festival should take place from August 8th to August 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most renowned festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the wheel of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 he founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
From 2002 onwards, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also responsible for producing, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvin Benn are working together to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I was working with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, Charlie Jones adds.
"Unfortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn, and we are about to start a great festival in an exceptional place, which will eventually serve the inhabitants of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park, after they emerged on the festival scene by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9,8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city environment.
"The European model of Melvina Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of the rural festival in Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The village of Vineland, including the mayor, is eager to support this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, claims "that they are sufficiently favourable to enable them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival which will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which includes 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed at the time the program is only put in print.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but music there will be very good to attract a wide spectrum of viewers if possible," says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promotioner award in the last year's Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This convincing mission is one of the delegates' tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because the Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult for the Governor to fall into his claws?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will consider to be the best," he said.
Celebrations for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcottea is a priority for promoting the local film.
The Oscar hunt has already begun.
At all Western Coast festivals, whether festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be a matter of presenting, highlighting, and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is offered in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
At the end of the year, will there be a marathon on the stock market? Experts split up the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and investors have already been waiting for me to arrive at a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view it has a month of positive progress on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in current contexts, there are certain doubts in the markets, at least in the short term."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange is moving in recent weeks, and they point out that "the stock market is maintaining the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the solid revenue effect of the turnover on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a calm course, not without volatility, "primarily because the impact of the likely decline in Fed's rates (Federal Reserve system) is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the manager of the sale of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"Not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures us.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
Yet all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end up a year or so closer to 16,000 points thanks to the repurchase of portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension acquisition that is taking place every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will occur earlier, on the second December week after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not consider that volatility would affect market direction.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index generated by US reports on the effects of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex brings up new maximum quotas.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series of strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, ensures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it comes to it.
"ACS has been regaining its position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cycle consumption will be ahead in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also do very well, even though they are not very well represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only two months of decline.
The real marathon took place at the end of 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be in order for the fifth profit year (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he will succeed in having his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of its branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group, which has also ensured several times that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening period of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening period by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for other entities to join this initiative, which supports opening-up trading times, or not.
That's exactly the purpose of the project set by the Bank of Popular.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, shopkeepers and shops from selected streets, where branch offices will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches in all of Spain in about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about fixing existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises branches that it already has in the trading zones by adapting them to the customer profile in each street.
This is complemented by another concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
Ángel Rivera’s Business Director assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment, since it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
Branch offices will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches have been selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to be a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized in immigrants, operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
Branches PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer to sell a large range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," Rivera says.
They've just agreed with Telefónico to sell mobile phones through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock market doubled the value of its rival Antony 3
We did it'.
This statement was made yesterday by Paolo Vasile, Executive President of Telecinco, in his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he stated that the television he was running doubled the value of his rival, Antony 3.
Only one thing ruined his joy: 'what I am sorry for is that it did not happen so that we would grow more, but because we have dropped less', he declared.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco finished trading by 2.54% yesterday.
This profit has shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
The market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) for Vocent (another 13%) thus, according to Bloomberg, amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million.
Her competitor, Antona 3, who dropped 1,52 % yesterday and dropped 40,5 % since January, has a half value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies assessed is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogoecable, 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antona 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in the audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is counting on the fact that overcoming a billion gross advertising revenue will become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecasted data were actually achieved, this channel would record an increase in advertising turnover by 3,6 % compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antony 3 increased by 1.6% (with a total of 734.4 million) while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors which analysts are focusing on is the increase in pay out for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevaría, splits 100 % of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after buying 33% of Endemol together with its Mediaset parent company.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market at these moments shows a certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced Telecinco’s profits by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the expected increase in income from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antony 3, 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles primarily on the basis of increased dividend income and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco better than Anton 3 (maintain) because of its 'opportunity' and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to underestimate them, as it faces 'similar threats' (saturated market and deteriorating economic environment).
Congress Approved MiFID transposition effective from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the Government has submitted to the public hearing of the regulations which are developing the new law in order to ensure that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trade Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets while at the same time strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advice services to be provided both to specialised companies, to natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advice companies (AIFs), which join securities companies, securities brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for carrying out financial instruments operations is expanding so that multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems are connected to regulated secondary markets that will compete with current stock exchange brokers.
The law further obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their trade profile, exposure to risks and risk management methods and requires that all the monitoring operations performed be reported for simplification by CNMV.
During the negotiations in the Congress Committee of Commerce, several amendments were included, among which it is that securitised claims are considered to be a "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high danger for the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to legitimately specify the functions which baccalaureates in the economy and management of the company might hold for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tens to 4,1 % in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices were developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat policy and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index but using different statistical modelling methods for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) pointed out that the information provided by this preliminary indicator was only indicative and therefore it did not necessarily coincide with the final data, which is known on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to remain relatively high"
The second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes announced that November's increase of ISC to 4.1% is "temporary" but also predicted that the price index will continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the Congress's spheres stated that "even if it is not a positive number", Spain's inflation differential against monetary union has continued to be "more or less" the same over the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said to the data presented today.
Virgin is planning to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since the Northern Rock crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion).
At that time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined over two and a half months with the mistrust of clients even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its Virgin Money brand, needs to obtain around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years in order to obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus achieve the goals of £30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group known in the United Kingdom with its prominent advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year for advertising and marketing to achieve its objective.
This week, the Northern Rock Bank marked the offer of a consortium of Virgin, which is made up of three other companies, such as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, in the early hours of the morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of Totana, the People’s Party, because of his alleged involvement in the construction practices that were discovered this week.
In addition, one of the City Hall's secretaries and the head of local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andrea replaced Juan Morales, a current human member of the people and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to the investigative sources of the television set by Caden SER, could be the 'head' of the entire business.
Police officers continue to monitor the buildings of the city hall and the construction commission, and no further arrests are pending in the next hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices, was charged with the construction that was discovered early this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'human' Member Juan Morales, who was checked, was arrested leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to the investigation sources, Morales' alleged selection is also the subject of an investigation commission for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which was requalified 200 hectares of land.
There are currently eight people detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toled candidate PSOE and, if they win, to chair the Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general election, headed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toledo, and in the event that the Socialists win the general election, he became President of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon in the federal seat of the party.
The chief of the ex-Minister's executive offer argued that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this policy from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
As chairman of the Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November his decision not to run in the next general elections and leave his active political career to address climate change in the context of university education.
The former Minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he had abandoned two years ago.
He further stated that, as well as citizens, they knew who would be deputy minister of the economy if PSOE won the election, his party wanted to announce in "transparency" who would chair the Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not a nagging or shouting" and to "be more and more like the citizens".
"Unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where Congress cannot speak calmly and peacefully has been interrupted by the Prime Minister of the Senate on one occasion 26 times."
He also gave praise to the address of current President Manuel Marin and his "good work" and he did not want to imagine himself in his place so far as to avoid falling in to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change submits to relentless persecution, both those who sceptically look at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Moreover, to have a leader of the movement who is the Prime Minister of Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the activity or inaction of his government has contributed significantly to Spain's leading the European Union not to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this happens, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it makes him as clear as possible as possible to explain to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will thus be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't see that explanation coming, and we're not gonna wait.
It's because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and menacing corporate and private accounts.
Even one centimeter from the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), appeared to Zapater to be so risky from the point of view of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so that it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, password lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And with contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he doesn't even speak, he doesn't charge, he doesn't demand anything, but he is decorated and nurtured.
If he restricts himself to being just a virtual party and does not ask us to ride a bicycle and cool off with a fan.
Mayor and head of local Totany police detained for suspected corruption practices in construction
As investigators informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andrea, the head of the local police, the town hall secretary and one entrepreneur in hospitality, for suspected of committing construction offences.
The Mayor was arrested in his residence and moved to the town hall, where he is now located with a number of police officers who have also arrived at the Construction Commission and the City Enterprise for Industrial Lands and Housing.
These three arrests came to six, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 houses after paying for illegal commission during the last election period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged with summary proceedings in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six of the first arrests were brought to court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana is being investigated and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and businessman from Vig, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar, who belongs to that group and without any payment being paid.
The investigation is carried out by a criminal investigation team in the construction of civilian guard operations units, whose members, apart from arrests, also conducted eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to arrested, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontivedra, Las Rosas (the province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at that time, in the area of a well-known owner of the company for poultrymeat products, which could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex of the Murcia City of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was designed to double the population of 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is formed by companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18th, on the same day that criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there in coincidence:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has been penetrated into public debate in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokel.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his notes.
Pekka Elo, the school councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested that Helsingin Sanomat, on the pages of the journal, that the professors take a critical view of Plato and that there was no need to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in high schools."

One colleague informs of the introduction of an offence of downloading from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you wipe out records at a price lower than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense ( § 623.1).
B. If you withdraw from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the criminal rate is lower than the download rate (paragraph 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading ( § 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate in fights than changing compacts.
Participation in riots would be between three months and one year (paragraph 154 of the Criminal Code) and the rate would be six months to two years for the exchange of compacts.
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is deemed to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on a DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyright-protected films is more punished than the provision of pornographic material by youth (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not mistaken, someone's got their hand, and that's it.

My medical doctor shoves one of his articles on strange research called "Money is causing brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The survey was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance imaging on the tomographer and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the lead group Displaying the neurogenics of the Institute of Life&Brin in Germany: "The biggest activity occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague wrongly."
Researchers observed that if they succeeded both, received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received twice, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting the state's Attorney General of the Court in The Hague criminals of the Balkan War for eight years.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which he took the title of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karlin List" (2006), in Spain, which monitors the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the pace of detective thriller in pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure on the countries concerned to draw up the network.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car which protects drivers in the event of an accident is a significant expense which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Selecting suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, you need to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance undertaking and the insurance undertaking.
This commitment shall take the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking shall receive an agreed insurance amount of certain amounts for the purpose of taking into account the damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance shall be the insurance price, which shall be determined taking into account the various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident is, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over 25 years of age and women must pay lower insurance fees, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that persons living in marriage have less accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving and the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in the frequency of driving increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the type of insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for selecting the type of insurance that, in addition to complying with the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages, such as limited experience in driving and short driving licenses when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are even cheaper options.
The most prudent drivers may choose insurance against all insurance risks with a discount so as to obtain insurance cover for all risks but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's participation in the compensation of the insurance event.
"The part of the compensation of the insurance event that the client will provide will be determined in advance in determining the insurance price, which will be higher than the participation would be lower," explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, insurance broker on the Internet.
Another option is insurance extended to other operators by providing insurance against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage caused by their own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of a vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is the reduction of the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, Malus is the increase in the mentioned base rate.
"Bonus and Malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it would be able to afford an increase in the bonus," explains Noguer.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, it is easier for drivers to agree on insurance, as the client risk index decreases, thanks to experience gained.
Therefore, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance when there is an accident, nor in driving," the director of the European company in Spain assures, adding that most accidents occur in the second year when the "newbie's fear" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks if, however, his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered as the lowest risk index client and thus their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all insurance risks (which could amount to EUR 300) or in the case of a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting on the third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is more peaceful and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford to gain the highest discount," says Luis Noguerer.
Pensioners are advised to provide insurance against all risks with a premium (EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been reached.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to study the insurance options that would be most suitable for us in the light of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan Point, which means the Oscifinals
AC Milan and Celtic will move their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, because it would be the first for Italy to be the first, and it would decide for the Scots to place it.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the process in the fifth game of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it needs one more to make sure that Shachtor does not get ahead with six points that will play with Benfika, which has four points.
These two matches of Group D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, because AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where he first takes the thirteenth in the semifinal, in an effort to reach the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group is going to be closed before the others and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men will try to win because the Italians won't want to tactics on the home land and Celtic knows that after winning, he would be the first and he would have made a better place in the osm final.
The man Gordon Strachan could be able to afford the process even if Shachtor does not win, but he can't rely on it, because at the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week will advance the same number of nine points, but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scottishs who believe they will get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they were defeated in the same game in the previous goal game with Kaka in extension (1:0) after state 0:0 in the basic game time.
Hoping to win the "rossoners" will be Shachtír, for which he has the prize of victory only if Celtic loses, both for the process to the eight-finals and for the UEFA survival.
Benfica, although last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could win third place with one victory, so she could play in the UEFA.
The first concert at the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver said that their band's reunion was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present for a concert, which also included a video that resembles the history of this group, which caused sensations at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tours take place at the same time as the new album released by the EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful compositions, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", the British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned it a few days ago.
Before the opening of Victoria Beckham's performance, she said of the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused two years later the dissolution of the five-member group, also revealed its nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," Chisholm said about the reunion of the group she had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in the course of time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much".
However, many things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls came out together in 1998.
In the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, an army of nurses was expecting them at the airport.
Five has 7 children in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He's going to be in Madrid on December 23.
Fears of a new gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the prices of natural gas, and so there is an increased risk that Russian supplies of this fuel can be affected in Western Europe.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is channelled through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas prices, Russia will be charged higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced deliveries to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli Kinach told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev resulted in a reduction in deliveries from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one-quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supply in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the NHS Scottish Chambers must improve the checks of criminal records with non-European employees.
The recommendation from the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was connected to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also fears that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report pointed out that the other key checks were conducted in an orderly manner on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office took an interest immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport on personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Eighty-two-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone hired Jeep to the building's main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being involved in attempted bombings in the United Kingdom.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK before their employment.
Although Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to control criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Office states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assist employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr Black said that Scotland's NHS in many ways coincides with its own pre-employment policy, but also added: "Our report points to areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign staff."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in Scotland's NHS work well and it is unclear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for the NHS in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the pre-employment control policy and directive for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated Directives for pre-employment checks of all staff - including foreign staff - that are planned to be issued next month.
Joy Division's got the movie prices
Control, a biographical film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including the price for the best film.
The prizes were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until Curtis played his role as director Anton Corbijn and later as Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been named the best actress for a thriller.
And the star of the Bondowek Daniel Craig got Variety award for getting the British movie on the world stage.
The awards were presented in London’s Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' trip to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - stood only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic packaging of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two prizes - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - because Julien Temple's film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the best actor as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronnenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for being hard men, won the Richard Harris award for an extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50 - year - old, whose films include Scum, Neil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is now filming another feature of Indiana Jones, the crystal skull kingdom.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened a door for people like me," he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, the great actor of his time, I am very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded to a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Bif stands and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Niggy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbott.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on the spiritual and security components.
The state television broadcast by the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers campaigned against the monarchy, the United States allies, since 2003, from the invasion to Iraq.
The TV report reported that the cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil installations in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid response unit of 35,000 members to defend equipment from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil factory in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 detainees belonged to a cell led by an "expert to launch rockets" that slipped into the country.
She added that the militants planned to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to make more efforts to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting an allied army and a Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be heretical.
Al-Qaida militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support a royal family that rules the government.
Militiants - supported by the challenges of leader al-Qaeda Saúda Usama bin Laden to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the state television interior secretary of the ministry.
16 members of the Media Cell were also arrested in Medina, which aimed to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims identified as non-believers and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a view of the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the surrounding European station shows that the planet is even more like the head twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and are on similar routes, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on earth and could have been inhabited.
But the frightened greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a rare perspective on how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of physics at Oxford University and one of the mission leaders, Venus Express, said: "It is increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite different.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with a population environment, billions of years ago."
The police detained "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched by uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
The police spokesman said three people were detained and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the debate on YouTube by the other party.
But questions and answers this time reflected many about the condition of the Republican party towards elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, were picking out clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest time devoted to one topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked the Panel of Undecided Voters to turn the wheel when they heard something comforting: the speaker noted the peaks of consent when the candidates talked about hard access at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who came forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was soft on an illegal immigrant as New York's prime minister.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two competed in particular on a timely basis when the applicants asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to put their little bit into the mill on this subject.
None of these guys have a chance at a nomination, but they're both staying in the game, perhaps, for starting to be alarmed about immigration earlier and harder than the others.
At least for immigration, candidates have the same opinion: greater tightness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the difference between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was getting very uncomfortable when it came to other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported the holding of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One of the candidates asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr Giuliani came across the idea that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another Taser asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who now opposes all assumptions in the recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run for office, thus benefiting himself from laughter.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's growth in Iowa is hiding with recent success in earning money and Ron Paul's loud joy in the middle debate.
These two reflected from the bottom because both wings of the parties still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the victorious report on American lip size, eclipsed on both sides' wings.
This time the party is disintegrated and the result has to be clear far away.
Laburists’ Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a custom for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It does not appear that any orders have been sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been felt.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without finding out that some wealthy businessman, after four years, has been masking the contributions of the Laburistic Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party has not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling the elections and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by research, there was hope that it would ensure a robust and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly funny president of the Liberal Democrats formulated it, the once feared Mr Brown changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unwarranted rescue of Northern Rock's troubled bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
The wrong proposals for amending the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative misdemeanor.
Three retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords; protested the cuts in military spending because they claimed that part-time work was to be the commander of the armed forces.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary general of labor (and their former keeper of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would go unrestrainedly towards his end.
Nevertheless, governments can reach the point of switching, which they find to be difficult to rule.
People don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but they usually put their trust aside when they take over the new party.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not doing anything better, and he doesn't have to be in the office long enough, this is a shift away: government becomes a hole, ministers start doing briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new bonnet against other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the financial records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as minister of finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blairov’s problems, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "money preferences", voters can easily say he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they look.
Those things aren't as terrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one has died or been defrauded.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable, firm and lightly brutal government.
The latest excitement around political gifts is a good example.
The Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not wish for his charity any publicity.
That may be true, but it wasn't up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of Mr Abrahams' procedure, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer of money who learned about the homicidal gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved in anything; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these skins, even though the main part of the payment took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but reduced his determination by reaching out to a certified instrument, the commission for the examination of the matter - also led by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, this is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding the permanent Chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has been missing for six months now, and making a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require laborers who are close to cooperating with conservatives and perhaps even giving up their special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a devoted customer, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent head start in the polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win the win is inconceivable integrity and high competence.
Cardboard sharks
Does the U.S. credit card market affect the mortgage crisis?
When there's blood in the water, naturally, the spinal cords begin to wave excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going down, predators are focusing on the local credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if additional consumer credit options were to be infected with sub-prime mortgages.
Signs of tension are obvious.
The number of cases of inability to pay (at more than 30 days of late payment) and write-off accounts (accounts which the provider considers to be indispensable) is increasing.
Last month, HSBC announced that it lost 1.4 billion dollars in the US consumer credit market - also due to non-solvent credit card loans.
But it's still too early to panic.
The write-offs and inability to pay are still short.
According to Moody's rating agency, 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost an entire percentage point below average.
The worsening rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 resulted in a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys that make a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and hence the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general terms for borrowers deteriorated.
The branch also shows a good degree of maturity, which shows how much consumers will pay out of their debts monthly.
And trust in secured credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup Research Company predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct routes for spreading the infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market are definitely there: when they dry out property loans in real estate, consumers are more likely to owe through credit cards.
However, credit card publishers tend to look at cash flow rather than at the value of handling items, so the falling prices at home may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous to the lenders.
Motivation of consumers to pay off mortgages falls when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, debt on cards moves up on the list of priority payments.
Card publishers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid change in the prices of handling items.
"It won't be one beautiful morning to re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of inferior mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower prices at home and debt cuts America into recession, the credit card sector will stand ahead of a darker future.
Watch out for those spinal cords.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
The three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with Enron Andrew Fastow's former financial manager, changed their statement on Wednesday and confessed their guilt.
David Birmingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven fraud charges, when, together with Fastow in 2000, they were supposed to participate in financial fraud -- to be rich on behalf of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to stand before the court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, has been on the front page for two years.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation initiated after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who received the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to design fraud together with Fastow and his former senior associate, Michael Copper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner office controlled by Fastowa, which was the architect of a lot of enron frauds, which were snorkeling Enron into the spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this branch zero, but our three British knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Copper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow has falsely informed Enron that the energy company will pay $20 million for its share in this Greenwich NatWest branch.
Of course, the 20 million actually went to British bankers, Fastov and others.
Bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by approximately $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastov pleaded guilty in two cases to conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper has been in prison for three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Brits were free on bail for $1 million that ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former head worker Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the collapse of society.
Skilling is in the hands of more than twenty-four-year sentence.
The verdicts against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-independence
The price of Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, they are small returns.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Führer, a rep for Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Führer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, a four-day orgy of a consummated consumer at the mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stands, hoping that the newly rich Russians would lure everything from the mahogany piled yachts to the diamond decorated bulkheads into cars, for which they would not be ashamed of 50 Cent.
Mr. Führer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"It's a nice car, but against us it's pennies and tithes," he said.
"By the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money flows into Russia's capital just as it did when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans got hugely rich and dragged to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, fourth-year-old listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi pitchers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, she attracted conferences of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian one.
(Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has, according to a list of the richest people in Forbes magazine, 53 billion people with total assets of $282 billion.
In addition, the Local Institute for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 there were 15.8% of Russians living below the borders of an existing minima.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London Jewelry David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are fine-tuned and men are all for money."
As they walked through evening dresses on Sunday night hallam, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatovová and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova considered themselves and their clients to be millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I can't decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who was dressed in branded clothes as a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looked like a home path.
The trade fair seemed to focus mainly on fresh rich people, brand-controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in road traffic so that they could walk through the warehouse, which is screeching by Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, pool tables at peace, Dubai apartments, Gund pliers and provan.
Members of the free public could buy tickets for EUR 30 (44,57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before rembrandt's reproduction image from hand-painted blue tiles in overlife size.
"Of course the Russians are interested in more gold."
Indeed, the sellers here say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from a brilliant log to a few famous brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires, or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of the King Koil bed, announced that he had sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, for $70,000.
Also the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, A1 Moto's sales manager, who features high-end cars with high-end alarms, that his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, adjusted luxury cars to sell three car bars in the style of connected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, who had an engraving of Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a round of ostrich skin or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconia, doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"They'll be put in their garage by 30 or 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing too exclusive, given the great rise in the prices of the properties here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably millionaires, at least on paper, when not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red telephone booths of British style filled with counterfeit bills worth millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The neighbors stopped by to throw around a bunch of money, or to get their friends to take photos on their cell phone, as they rest in the middle of their alternate wealth, or just pump out a couple of million bucks.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant here about something healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the white New England house for two houses down the West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined.
And then another.
"So I saw the delivery of the medical examiner arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Newwar Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked in House 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not yet be known, will help solve the mysterious death that caused a wave of sadness by the leadership of the Newwar police.
Ms. Arroy has been assistant police director Gary F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former non-war police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drink Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons at the age of 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the Union district, Theodore J. Romankov, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy had died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It is one option," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still under way."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was reported dead on the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flore Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if Miss Castro's authorities had heard.
The investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink bush in the front garden and a dalmatin barking in the back, no one responded.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanilla" was held in an open garage, which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York police department in Newark for the first time after 25 years, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in sifting through the unbearable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'On this one or this one, you should be careful," he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will reduce interest rates leads to the strengthening of world markets
The share prices on both sides of the Atlantic rose yesterday after the market's hope that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were strengthened by the soothing statements of the US Central Bank's vice-president.
Exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of Fed, said that in responding to the continuing pressure on financial markets, the managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of a clear effort to calm irritated markets in the middle of signs resuscitating credit efforts, Mr Kohn said that recent thrills "particularly reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets by the end of September and October".
He further stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and companies further deteriorated will increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital benefits to US markets, and perhaps another reduction in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm Wall Street in the middle of other bad news about the American economy, when the sale of flats in October showed record low numbers.
The effects of financial belief were underlined by Bear Stearns' investment bank's announcement that it would abolish 650 jobs, which is 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs due to compensation for the heavy losses caused by an unregulated loan for low-priority housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289,40, while the more used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE Index 100 increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with British blue-chips increasing by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax Index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit strains on markets showed themselves in full force after the auction of the three-month cash packages of the European Central Bank was lending these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release over-standard money on London’s monetary markets has increased with the rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rising from uninterrupted growth since 12 November to its maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context of no less relevant than the first Sri Lankan test, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the best time available at this post, has Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, with a decision to help, and because Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, is beginning to fill the applications for the national selector's post, not necessarily to the fullest extent.
The one who will not be built in the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport at all.
It's not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets to the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult and requires a judgment which must in the end be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, is it?
We could ask ourselves the same question in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leaders with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is for only one.
Who's to say what level is right for cricketers when he can't get a chance to fall or swim on the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
On the team, the cricketer must at the right time capture the Captain's view if he is to take the Wicket, and the burner needs a regular chance at starting positions if he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the selector's view is more complicated.
For example, in last year’s season there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seemed certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as a artillery.
Anderson took 32 victs in first class at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at an equally secret average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
If he plays the Asgiri Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can run or end both careers, or it may not have a great influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class gave good performances, five victs and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricket who is also, although in Australia against Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, may still be underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in follow-up to today's training purely at Asorgia Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful vigor.
There are arguments for both of us.
For Shah, he speaks his colorful and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Bopars, who, in twenty-two years, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
But Shah did two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home playground in Middlesex, just ten runs, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to retake him for the next game, his firing seemed to be something of the Elan that was so evident in Bombay.
On the other hand, the Essex University has joie de vivre in its bones.
On the cricket field, nothing scares him, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English team car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching him from afar to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopar is definitely better in the field, with its medium-speed loop pitches on the playgrounds that seem to suit him, giving out effectively and firing confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I tend to avoid Bopar getting his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Chilean tea leaves suggest, he'll be the one playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and to dump the fugitives whose money or visa expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who expelled them from their homes.
The Mansur Bus Station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy for a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back for what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper, for what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni district of Amariah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariah called him in that the local defense with the support of the American army helped extricate al-Qaeda from her positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"On the eve of the day, a few friends called me and told me that she was going to Sleikh militia against al-Qaeda and that she needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah the 20-year-old Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of the local "groups of interested citizens", which are being held in arms by the American army to defend its quarter.
But more than that, they have been brought back by obstructions around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 1-year-old father of three, voiced suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people escaped Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqi visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
The partial reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunni have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again exhale sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Malik Sarska, good education
Germany's smallest federal country plays a leading role in professional education and even excels at the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational area is Sarsko concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who doesn't come from Syria, I explained yesterday after 50 that we are not French" - this self-ironic password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
In addition, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
Thus, universities have traditionally worked closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by France.
To this day, students can end their studies with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students corresponding to which is 15,6 %.
After all, an excessive number of Saran children are admitted to university - many of them even without a high school degree.
"A professional education system is being used in Sarajevo," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
By gaining more than one fifth of the year's education qualifications in vocational education, Sarska is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarajevo to combine practical and academic education.
The ability to study two fields is the best in Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of graduates of engineering has dropped by one third in recent years.
That is why the Sar Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to launch a promotional campaign in engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pis we conducted several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the Government has implemented comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to learn as soon as possible, the last year of the maternity school is free - a model that is taken over by other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, they will show when a future comparative study is conducted.
In the implementation of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In total, however, there has not been as much improvement in the country as in other federal countries.
Beavers can count better.
And to disappoint Sarah, the Pis study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarah could point in this particular area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in high schools - even though the inhabitants of Hungary are not French.
Chavez shifts hours
What not to see will go hours in Venezuela other than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will move hours in this South American country half an hour back.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
According to the new law, Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that hours will shift by minus four and a half hours against world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, including the fact that the United States had forced the division of time zones throughout the hours.
In the middle of local time, Chávez also announced that he was breaking relations with neighbouring Colombia because of the hostage situation.
This leftist nationalist has declared that as long as Alvaro Uribe is the conservative President of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can no longer, because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who advocates reform of the constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument prompted Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe, in his decision Venezuela, "sowed in the face", criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile call here sparked the alarm: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - so the sentence that has already pulled more than half a million people off the Internet.
It was expounded by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit, the loud remarks of this leftist populist became so angry that he silenced him in this way.
Germany faces lower salaries in 2007
According to the forecast, the German employees are facing a reduction in real wages this year despite strong conjuncturing.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007, employed people can realistically expect to receive lower wages than last year.
"The blame is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute of Research of IMC (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New employee burdens may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück to Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung said that by the new year the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Joint Labour Agency should no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the youth, according to the newspaper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products has driven inflation from its highest status in the last 13 years.
In the annual comparison, the price overall increased by three percent.
Venus is a hell of a twin Earth.
Despite its life, the enemy atmosphere is much more similar to Venus Earth than ever before.The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightnings in the atmosphere and windy winds in the fields.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is glowing.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. At Venus, lightnings from the cloud to the cloud at about 56 kilometers, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the origin of the original matter, life could be created on Earth by flashes, and the storms allegedly triggered in the oceans a reaction that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
It wasn't like that on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been long ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today something could barely be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"The prisoner may be a hell of a twin of the earth, but he is a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so much the same as Earth, began to develop in a completely different way, is the basic question of Esa.
Since no probe has been sent solely to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in this planet's research.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which approached several articles of Nature magazine, did not only highlight Venus’s uniqueness in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more similar to Earth than previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind winds in the north pole, scientists have found a darker vortex in the south pole, which spins much faster.
This phenomenon reminds the air currents of the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spasale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system is made up of almost the same material as Earth, and with an average of 12,100 km, it is almost as big.
This planet, named Jitřenka or Vecernica, will orbit the sun in almost 225 days.
But around its own axis, it spins much slower. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not remember the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists suggest that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
There was water piled up on both sides, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while Venus vanished into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound on Earth in carbonates, Venus is home to most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands the closure of the party disputes for the acceptance of the Dalai Lám in the office of chancellor.
Directly criticised the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a great coalition to end the dawn around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves outside as a nation that is not united in this issue," Köhler told economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Merkel from taking a stand when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a single China.
China also knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave his opposition to the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "predictive" foreign coalition policy.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lám in the Chancellor's Office, the German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, the so-called strategic dialogue of the ministries abroad also froze.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, said Wen Jiabao of China.
The words and acts of the dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have erupted in France
Street fights with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that the social dissatisfaction in Germany does not rise in violence on the street, the Minister of the Interior urges.
The barricades were burning, the rioters were shooting shotguns at the police. After serious youth disturbances in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that we also do not create social tensions that erupt in violence.
We have to take this seriously," Neue Press said in the Hannover newspaper.
Not every young person seems to be able to cope with a rapid change in social realities.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to address problems, Schäuble said.
Which means not only the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the conference on Islam, we record our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past nights, youth and police in the northern suburbs of Paris were lured into a hard street fight.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by Turkish municipality head Kenan Koat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
The wheel pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "excessively high".
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
The wheel stressed: "We must give the youth hope."
The president of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
In addition, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
The wheel said, "But we have to be careful."
We have to make a youth "quickly allow them to start working and learning."
Meanwhile, the night was left in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bell mostly calm.
Hundreds of police were deployed and helicopters flying over the area.
The authorities in charge reported three arrests and several incinerators and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 regular forces have been at work for peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, announced after visiting the suburban minister of the interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In riots in the suburbs of Williers-le-Bell, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, they captured Toulouse's unrest.
The riots caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the State Department, the police are not to blame for the deaths of young people.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The Chancellor's reality of the distant output documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we cannot expect anything more from it.
What country does this chancellor actually live in?
After her inconsolable, unrelenting and contentless performance in the general debate of the Federal Snow, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately manage.
On the note that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded with a very arrogant sentence once.
That's the province, she said, which showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
She showed everyone in the Social Hall how much she deserved the remorse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a feeling of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "The Cloud" was presented: a political one that excels above others who flee into foreign policy and express itself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: without ceasing, praises the conclusions of the Heiligendam Summit, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
In fact, such self-pity - so much modesty would have forgiven the chairman of the CD two years ago.
Now it is limited to plans of phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
This approach harms the image of a pragmatist who does not need flattery because of the problems he solves.
But in the realm of Angela, "The Clouds" are internal political problems border issues.
Child poverty and concern for low-wage people?
She had a few side effects on these subjects.
It's worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to children's allowances, argue.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning to succeed in saying at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things start to be too specific, they collapse like in an entirely foreign field.
Department of Attack
In the case of Redy Giuliani and Mitta Romney's favorites, the debate between the Republican President's YouTube candidates spread out in a brief discussion - and they both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney beats his rival Rudy Guiliani to make New York "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with harsh sentiments: "I believe that his own home was just one such refuge," he responds and preempts former Governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base does not have a clear front, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, internet users recorded and over Youtube uploaded videos only serve as such tips of a key theme.
"This is precisely the policy of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to seize power," says John McCain, a rival to Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare Romney's remorse for refusing to condemn the torture method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the campaign does not include war in Iraq or torture.
The audience applauds whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
It shows where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney scrupulously and asks the party base and television audience for forgiveness for having been in favour of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express himself in the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first ruled a civilian
The day after his resignation from the military commander's position, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
That ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharraf, made a presidential oath on Thursday and will remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan’s television broadcast a lively ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the Constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military commander’s office to his confidante, Ashfaq, Kiyani, who was subjected to international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after the bloodless military coup took hold, the former general reigns for the first time as the civilian head of the state.
Musharraf has met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West by withdrawing from his position as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state, which Musharraf declared on November 3rd.
According to Chief State Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayuma, Musharraf will terminate the exceptional state soon after his oath, and thus meet another of the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country which Musharraf, after the declaration of exceptional status at the beginning of November, imposed on him favored lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack on a military convoy in the northern Vaziristan tribe area, and four others were injured.
The speaking army said the bomb went off on the road near the Afghanistan border.
The father's car is coming back.
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. The three members of the Harmonia Group recaptured their electronic synths at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will include Live 1974, cut from the best period of the band.
They were already more widely known abroad.
The reported sensation then rests in the performance of three seated gentlemen, who at first look like they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables, and buttons in front of them.
Three-and-a-half-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snowy white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left, there's a 7-year-old Michael Rother with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Three-seven-eight-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on synthesizers, is on the right side of the viewers.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, are not part of the traditional composition.
It doesn't seem to bother the masters of musicians much.
Among the Krautrock lovers, a revival band Harmonia caused considerable excitement.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pop, but it is certainly not too busy for someone who has suffered a painful loss for twenty-three years.
But why not even the German celebrate his still living legends in the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, the mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and in America, is worth more than in its own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne Group Can Prize Echo for Life’s Work, the hall was full of questionable views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu for their speech!, the audience’s admiration was no longer known.
Michael Rother later, at Red Hot Chili Peppers, sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
Remembering the Harmonia band, we overreach the memory unnecessarily, this trio existed for only two years, and at that time it did not have the effect that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the cellar of Berlin’s Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at the phonograph company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but he gained fame as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother was followed by musicians from the band Cluster to exile in Forest, Weserbergland.
There, in the 16th - century ruins of Old Weserhof, they lived as members of the communes who fled the city.
They didn't live as ideologically here as in commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to kick as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for this art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing congregation Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the dumpster.
Many of it was preserved by Harmony.
The first album was called "Harmonia Music" and the next was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Assemblement was more than self-recognition.
Now released CDs "Live 1974" were released at a concert in Griessem in front of a record small, barely 50-member set.
Rothera then expressed the desire for members of Harmony to be shunned and to exercise on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a totally inappropriate request.
In 1975 the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with an album called The Burning Heart.
The Cluster band relived in the 1980s, and since then, it's been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland has taken the goal of observing Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu Chapel was considered a solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The Wildtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
That's how we planned the overall impact of Krautruck on future pop music.
The empty seat of the famous group will be filled by Harmony.
The branch of Brian En, accompanied by the strangest sounds, is carried in the hall: "The unique true music, its future belongs to it."
There are paintings in which the producer of Harmony is in the agricultural session.
The creation of a legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which are a set of devices of wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again employed with improvisation.
Not sticking microphones to the organ and drums to get those unheard of self-made tones out of the instruments.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three punk-ass techs.
There is no change in the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It was never a rock.
We would find roots rather than blues in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who screams "'68!" isn't that far from the truth, but Harmony won't let himself out of peace now.
Even the most obvious on the stage is carefully thought out.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question either prepares or allows a person to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
Two films of the Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden showed up on the Balkan War.
But none of them are convincing.
The motion of films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or are too touching.
The Hunting Party won't even stop a actor like Richard Gere.
Good news for the first time: War criminals Karaditi and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere will see himself.
We have recently lost this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played many of the popular, unserious roles in fine women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, they will take a taste for another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does a hunter become a prey (Why must the films of today be so long and confusing?).
His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who had his best years behind him, but still has a remarkable charm as a waste of a similar monument.
But despite this trumpet is The Hunting Party together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters movies this week, just continuing with an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan War.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who will save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, one of whom will fall in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbians are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film changes too soon into shooting and action.
There's a lot of similar Kobra 11 shows left out of the movie, without a freeway, but for the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can examine carefully why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good movie.
The story of three American war reporters, who claim to be "a different", a Serbian top war criminal, could at another time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard) possibly become the new "Apocalypse".
The two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their path will become a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the vain and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal will also prescrib a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party film can be written off with final effect after reporters in the last five minutes of the film have been led by what NATO, CIA and all the criminals of the world have failed in the last five years: to catch criminals and leave him fair revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it's worth turning to the International Court of The Hague.
But this film has a profound human message.
It condemns the fact that Karaditi and Mladic are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (then exceptionally united), that they do not pursue the persecution quite intensely on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are so similar sometimes, women attack us with the famous Brecht poem.
In it is the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting how hard it is to be evil."
In films such as The Hunting Party are performing exactly the kind of swollen heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war on the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One thing can be added: no good film about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always applies: When the star is wandering through the crisis area or passing through the minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Border of break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri will be created.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close.
After all, they had to run for decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must be produced - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The deer hunter", "The apocalypse" or "The lead vests" - were never celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears immediately on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the writers do not have the ability to unmistakably tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" had become so good because Lubitch and Chaplin had not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically measured artistic look like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said, "The likeness only happens in that some things never change.
The great crowds will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust gathers criticism for the denial of the Olympics
The Mayor's resignation from the Olympic Summer Games in Hamburg has met a sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for water play.
Von Beust, but he's encouraging realism in his guess of chances.
On Wednesday, the head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz marked this decision "from the point of view of business as unfortunate".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to keep this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which stems from a modified time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on Olympic candidacy," said von Beust to the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Michov's candidacy for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan of 2028."
Yet this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It will be felt that Hamburg does not want to leave the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy our chance to mark the plans at this early stage as buried," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Failure to resign would be contrary to the announcement of the head of the Senate at the general assembly of the General German University Sports Union.
Von Beust did not announce his nomination at the University in 2015 as a substitute for the Olympic Games.
In the past week, the Hamburg Sports Union nominated the candidate city.
The faction of the SPD in the Chamber of Hamburg of the Senate stated that it was wasting valuable time, which could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grasbrook area has been blocked by the Senate for years because he bet on organising the Olympics and building the flats he ruled out," said SPD Members Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the whole area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on "Olympic Factor".
Caring for a summer Olympic game in 2012 sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the expressions of Sweden and wooden boxes, they don't think of Andy Warhol, they think of Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden crates currently produced in Sweden are thrown on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadow.
Most of him on the list of the above-mentioned ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" type Stockholm are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" several months ago expressed doubts about Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, an internal research by the Modern Museum in Stockholm with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum Moderna Museet donated a gift to its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type that are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are an entangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wooden crates, which were based on the red mordant design of paper boxes of soap powder Brillo.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their plays, just show pieces.
Warhol apparently gave permission in 1968 also for several wooden Brillo Beddens to be produced in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in Moderna Museum.
These witnesses are now talking about 15 crates, which then rightly entered artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred pits were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten Beden were produced in Malmö for exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Bystrom, the supreme conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after having been painted with the basic color and adorned with the brush with oil white.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the color was applied without the previous basic coating to the paint plate directly - in addition, it was acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's Official Charter of the Brillo Boxes," the director of Modern Museum, Lars Nittva was told: "If the organization Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, Moderna Museum will have to classify six of its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy".
Already in July, the Authentiation Board announced that these "competence charges" that were raised in the soap powder boxes will be dealt with.
However, the organization has so far been in a state of inexhaustible silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers, who had established themselves in a hotel in Manila, demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who was pointing out to the president of manipulation and corruption in elections, told reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were ensnared in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood in court for a dream attempt to turn in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the meetings to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to watch him apparently ran to his side and joined the rebellion.
