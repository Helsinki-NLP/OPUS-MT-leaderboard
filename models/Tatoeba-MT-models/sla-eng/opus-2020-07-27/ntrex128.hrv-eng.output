Welsh MPs are worried that they will "look like Muppets"
Some MPs (A. Assembly Member, AM) were amazed at the proposal that they could be called members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans for the assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentary representatives from all political spectrum are concerned that they might become the subject of a complaint.
A parliamentary representative from the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name "rimmered with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on Welsh twp means dumbass, and pwp shit.
Parliamentary representative from the Wales side (Ul. Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" for a change of name, but that the MWP could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the capital letter "w" is pronounced similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
A parliamentary committee that is currently preparing a law to introduce a change of title said: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be titled will be on their own."
The law of the government of Wales in 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee announced the results of a public consultation on proposals that met with broad support for changing the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what will be called MPs in the Assembly, the Committee was inclined to refer to "members of the Welsh Parliament" or to MPPs, but the option of MWP received the highest support during the public consultation.
Parliamentary representatives propose alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could bring headaches to the president of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill of amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the Parliament operates, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on change of country name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the occupation of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent for change of title, said he would not recognise a referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin were silent as the churches in Harlem struggle for survival.
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are hanging out today in a different way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living quarters of the neighborhood where people are regularly staying."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and "before or later will be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with dwellings where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held the services nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson leading a small boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving black people.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July used a second term: "cultural treasure" and "non-replaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world in which the black musician Dionisio A. Lind played for 18 years on a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which have been brought by lay leaders of the church and other Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, the managing body of the parish made up of laymen, wrote in July for the concern that the diocese "will seek to shift the costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during a lobster dive in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving after a lobster in California on the day of the lobster season opening.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then took the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was about the excitement of the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn apart.
"I scolded everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the Larry Giles rescue team said at a press conference that the shark was spotted in the area weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for the purpose of conducting an investigation and the safety of the buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entry into the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic counters in the style of department stores and hiring specialised sellers.
As part of a large entry into the UK beauty market worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow compared to the decline in sales of clothing and home equipment, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and extended to additional stores next year if proven successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the shelf space that used to be provided for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the size of the offer of cosmetic products to 3000 products, including for the first time trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
And the existing assortment of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will test using concessions in two Sainsbury’s trade, the first to be opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second to be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Networking and returning to daily shopping for small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’sa, said the outlets would look more and more like a department store as this chain of supermarkets tries to resist favourable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s launched the Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, thus citing the sale of foodstuffs and making the acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s joined a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended with a dispute over the distribution of drug profits in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold his pharmaceutical business in 281 Celesi, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds claims to have a role in the plan by including in four stores a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director Sainsbury said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our department with cosmetic products to give our users a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in the special training of colleagues who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract
Star of Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones left that “he cook of rage” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract with his trademark to focus on his new contracts with the brand of Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and Truly fashion accessories.
Their trademark is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of this Morning (37) on Instagram announced she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragon’s Peter Jones show to cook with rage by pulling herself out of a joint profitable job at the last minute to focus on her new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim Jones was "angry" when a gold girl television met on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant that there was no time left to devote to their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
This job was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have provided it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was a shock to everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the whole line.
There's a lot of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that due to the departure of this Morning, one of the UK's most profitable investment stars, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and possible additional delay in the movement of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as president of the board in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McCorlin as the host of the ITV show I’m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Heavy negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the papers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude toward North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
said Trump, imitating the leader of the news.
"I gave no concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the denuclearization negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice a "corresponding reaction" of the United States to disarmament activities in North Korea.
He noted that the United States had not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude at the meeting in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – stopping test rocket launches, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It is so easy to act as president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people to enter the arena, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of us.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so all this is a bit problematic," Mrs. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children's organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
In view of the constant shaking of the ground in Indonesia, this country remains sadly unprepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The lack of siren for tsunami warnings in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best of times, travel between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters further hamper logistics.
The hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to deal with the earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes him at least three days to get to the site of the new disaster.
Improving the Indonesian decayed structure was the foundation of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
However, the state administration under Yokoo is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and a new election is held next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Player Daniel Sturridge scored a match match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea at the 89th minute score at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was approximately 30 meters from the Chelsea goal score of 1-0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite statue.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper edge of the network.
In the end, the ball escaped Kepay Arryzabalagaj, who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was demanding to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and only once touch the ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half with 1-0 after shooting the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning somewhere in half the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and with his left foot hit the ball in the net on the opposite statue by the goalie Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a club competition against Napoli in the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of fatalities in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Disaster Office said Sunday morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference that he reported that a large number of people were trapped in the buildings' ruins after an earthquake of 7.5 Magnitude, which occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6m high.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is packed with remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspected murder after the woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
Police have invited people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to address us, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found by Birkenhead's resident and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew this woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and police have said the process of informing the victim's next of kin is under way.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one can get into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were now told that it would take several hours until they could return to their homes.
The officer allegedly told someone that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying: “It’s so terrible. ”
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of officers were standing inside the fenced area and overseeing the housing block.
Of all who have any information, they are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, they call 101 or anonymously refer to Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111, calling for minutes 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of a debate on "the breakup of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr Crick's attempt "stupid" and "I'm trying to break history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate currently under way regarding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of a debate.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent revival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the way of thinking in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a person that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is thought by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century rather than today, to defend parliament against external pressure.
Is this a fully credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of honor and marking."
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in Southwest China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead cut arteries and covered with blood near a stand at a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China's Morning List reported on Sunday.
Pig breeder was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province of China.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighed 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
Evening news Guiyang said a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that a pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the management of the market are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rarely the case, the pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kilo pig laid a Welsh farmer by the tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "challenge".
"They're just played.
They nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
All they need is to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters in the area of North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States during the following days.
Rosa blew at 05:00 East Time at 140 km/h, which makes her a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area is being created and moved towards the West Coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture in the direction of the north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture in the interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the formation of strong falls in the large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mud floods and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of precipitation that will amount to approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain are expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above the larger part of Arizona.
The floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
There is no advice on going to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical falls.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storm winds and dust wind.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains along the coasts of southern California.
It is possible that there are gaps in the volume of more than 12 mm, which may cause less mudlides and road slides.
It will be the first landscaping in the wet season in this region.
Spoiled tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday late evening and Monday morning before late Monday morning and Tuesday covering the wider area.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to an area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched and lasts all day Wednesday.
In October, huge temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the delayed summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in the majority of the Central and Eastern United States, the beginning of October will be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to the parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great deal of possibility for above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks a tense testimony by candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political hearing continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to inform on the turnaround at the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Board that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was touching her in a drunken state and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a zealous testimony that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
Friday's hearing was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch content in offices.
To give you a better credit, it's about a crowd that's a lot like the one who's watching American football or Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose study guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great even after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, they recorded protesters shouting at him while trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
For a few minutes he stood looking down while live in front of CNN's cameras, the demonstrators filled him with insults.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him: “You have power while so many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement before the elevator door closed to say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidates next week, which was demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and then a few more senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her exit plan from the European Union of playing "policy" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, continued criticising her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit in another interview with her on the cover in the same issue, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs fees is "total nonsense".
Wayde Sims' murder: police arrested Dytheon Simpson, the LSU player's death suspect
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of a gun by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained on charges of manslaughter, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of a conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the CBS branch reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A guarantee of $350,000 has been requested.
East Baton Rouge County coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the federal police refugees Louisiana, the criminal laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked local authorities for implementing the law on "strengthening and seeking the truth."
Simms was 20 years old.
A player on a wing 183 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash on Mexico City
The ash that casts out the volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
A national disaster prevention centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increasing activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash for 24 hours.
The center followed multiple lashes and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windshield glass cars in Mexican City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of volcanoes located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Controversy between police and Catalan separatists in the face of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors who advocate independence clashed with intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by intervention police began shooting cops with eggs and paint in powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights also broke out later during the day the police used batons to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, groups that advocate independence have been chanting "There is no oblivion, no forgiveness", and against them the unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
The tensions in an independent region did not subside for a year after the October 1st referendum that Madrid declared illegal, which the Catalonian separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the turnout was low because those who opposed secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The groups that advocate independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take the second route.
Narcissus Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry happy they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a crucial, although close, victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan Independence Party is struggling this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who on his phone recorded demonstrations in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who announced since the end of last year that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Candiding for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after being stabbed in the house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit by a car more than once in a London-Derry house.
The incident took place Thursday around 7.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blommmings said the courtyard doors and the building themselves were damaged.
It's possible that a crossbow was fired on a car at some point.
Menge score brought Livingstone victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0.
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston has won
The new Scottish Premiership League Club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of the 18 games at the head of the Ibrox stadium club.
Dolly Menge's shot proved decisive while Gary Holt's team aligned in a second with Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still without victory in the Premiership guests this season, and the next Saturday they're playing against Hearts, the leading league club with eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday as part of the European League.
Livingstone, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and chief coach Holt hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against the dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they scored that hit, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he slipped to intercept the head of Craig Halkett towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble to the guests.
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free shot, and Livingstone designed the opening, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisted Mengi who scored in the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had largely control over the ball, but they faced impenetrable domestic defenses, so goalie Liam Kelly was largely out of business.
That continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Goldman Ranger Allan McGregor's legs got in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a wide shot from another organized Livingstone attack.
The long additions failed to cross the Livingstone goal line, and two 11 were not sentenced – after Halkett's conflict with replacement player Glen Middleton and one for hand-playing.
"Great" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and Livingston's score.
All to one were excellent, thus continuing to overestimate expectations on that entry path.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to large clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a breath during the entire game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They didn't make it to the end, they only opened the hole in the home team once, and it's a sort of call to kick for the Rangers in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), all was full of smiles under the bright sky when the leader of Tursa and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- aimed at improving relations between NATO's allies.
They differed in opinions on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters came to see him nearby.
And hundreds of Erdogan's protestors – a large number of them Kurds – raised their voice by condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him with a welcome in the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist fatally killed in a car crash
A biker died in a car accident in London.
The crash took place near the crossroads of Bestwood and Evelyn, on the road with heavy traffic in Deptford on the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but a man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the escape of a driver from a place with an accident on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half away from Saturday’s crash site.
City police say police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his next of kin.
Due to the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 police officers injured in riots
The prison board said six police officers were injured in disturbances in the imprisoned male prison.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and still continue.
Special Tornado units have been brought to combat riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were provided with assistance for minor facial injuries.
Prison Service spokesman said: "A particularly trained prison staff have been hired to resolve the incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff received assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be committed to the police and that they could spend longer behind bars."
In Long Lartin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, intervention police were called to prison to deal with a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with lush floods (a possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen at the beginning of the next week when Hurricane Rosa takes the remaining power across the Desert Southwest and poses a threat to the floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings on the lush floods for Monday and Tuesday in the area of Western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday along with the rain and cross right over on Tuesday.
In its tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported that “only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Urban Centre foresees 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including Stjenjak and the Great Pool there is a probability of 25 to 50 mm downhill, with possible isolated totals up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of lush floods, Rosa could come as salvation because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these lands could be useful because drought is currently in the southwest.
"According to the American map of dry areas, slightly over 40% of Arizona has been hit at least by extreme drought, the second highest category," the weather.com reported.
The hurricane journey first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was heading north at 20 km per hour.
The storm came upon the colder waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will be approached by the forces of the tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant threat to floods.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, which is at maximum 250 mm", the weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico like a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass across Arizona and in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rose or her remains is the very strong rains on the peninsula of Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the US Desert Southwest," said the National Centre for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and mud sprawls in the deserts of the mountain field.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST was found on Saturday in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, a injured teenager.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset's police administration reported that 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in Radstock's area.
Police officers have called in everyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the wrath of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger of the Democratic Party" during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and firmly and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault charges decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at a hearing on the charges she made.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's approval is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in the public service," he said, said to the assembled supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican election in half of the presidential term.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the mission was a Democrat to "create resistance and obstruction".
The Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of fatalities in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and numbers continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, from which a large number of them drew huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves of up to six metres high struck the coast, dragging many of them to their death and ruining everything in their path.
Tsunami followed after the earthquake of the 7.5.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run, and they were killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape tsunamis and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The photos from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Subsequent blows continued to shake that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) announced that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two dozen nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications are completely broken and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," says the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers were headed to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism over the lack of information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim the waves came at the moment a warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, it can be heard that a man on the top floor panics people down on the street about the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters agency couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the power loss that caused the interruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, she began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other necessary supplies.
City airport is open again only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit evacuation centres in Palou on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has taken more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of World Vision from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Pala, where employees were placed in the tarpaulin tents placed in the yard of their office, they forwarded the destruction scenes on the road," Mr Doseb said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only start if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'Okay, it is a national disaster' we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Pal on Friday, friends and families of those who are still considered missing were hoping that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, the rescue workers liberated a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"In view of the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which expanded to the paraglider community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging ATMs downtown Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole 26,750 US dollars from Brink's employee who charged an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, says a press release for the Newport police department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement says that the driver of the car was emptying the ATM machine in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man “came to Brink’s employee behind his back in the race ” and stole the bag with the money to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not list the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the NYPD at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
On Saturday's Twitter release, which announced the change, he wrote: "The living will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of its eighth album published in June.
The change comes ahead of his visit to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariane Grande who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being the shortcut to his current artistic name, West had earlier said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that the most commonly used word in the Bible is 'yes', and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in a discussion about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It started with Kanya, which means “the only one”, in Ye alone – it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And former West associate, JAY-Z, used to play with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the army against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use his army against the Mexican people. ”
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations in that square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the moment left student movements began to spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in research in this area," said the investor in artificial intelligence and expert for this area Kai Fu Leeu, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US in principle lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the first AI-innovation country by 2030.
"A double increase in the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double increase in investment could double the chance that the next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the US," Lee said this week in a CNBC interview.
Lee, whose book "AI Magnified: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on the AI system that beat Othello's best player, and later was the director of Microsoft's research department and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous US government technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the following will be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It is not China that takes academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds from the university to work on research into artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that Ph.D.'s in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese National Council announced the Roadmap for the development of artificial intelligence next generation in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to people in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organisations provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than 100 million US dollars a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation that wanted to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has lasted for several decades and has blocked Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its occupation of territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on a proposed new title, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent required to make the referendum valid.
The issue at the referendum voter's ballot said: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's collapse, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
Name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has stated that no irregularities have been reported by 13 hours.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, joined the country's referendum on the change of name in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would pave the way for NATO's accession to the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set up a small stage and received chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the exalted heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much needed investments to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research shows that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will approach the referendum, which is below the required response.
A second poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the politics of the Western government since it took over its mandate in May last year.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling won the 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made victory insanely simple, achieving a 65-minute hit.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defense players and then made it to the open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He went around a defender and then overcame a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
That's when he added the ball left to Sterling.
The English attacker from his first attempt returned the ball to Aguerre, who threw the right-wing ball into the right-hand side of the net and beat the Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulty with his foot," journalist Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reported.
"We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the clash of the Premier League.
That shot was made in 29 minutes.
During that game, Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court.
Beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sanne pushed the ball a few times before leading Sterling towards the statue.
Sky Blues' attacker threw the ball into the net just before he slipped into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim at the Champions League group game Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Aren stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' advancement
Since Nationals' players were eliminated from playoffs, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get to play.
On Friday night the Rockies won 5 : 2 nad Nationals at least secured a place in Wild-card play, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce a Sunday starter, but apparently they're inclined to offer Scher a game.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up Thursday in the pitcher room and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-wing from Washington achieved a score of 18: 7, an average of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 two-thirds changes this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the turnout of Republican voters in the general elections, the president made a general comment on his election of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we've done will be on trial in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “See this terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, it is happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, so they want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he says, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You've seen this for the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt and lying".
He addressed Democratic Senator Dianna Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee with a name, causing a loud disdain for the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- it was really bad body language, worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
It does not tolerate personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who were told they were not welcome – and all because of what we said in mind.
According to my associate, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby in the censorship proposal.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with previous leadership.
At the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday, it was stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I've been working as a local representative of the Labour Party's Main Council meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentleer" policy has long been forgotten if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since associates whom I thought we were sharing similar political opinions from me began to demand drastic change of opinion and positions that I would otherwise disagree with – whether it is national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – there's a lot of offensive words on social networks that call for my recall, which reject the center's policies and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the avalanche of sexist or racist comments daily, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me most is to tolerate offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect differing opinions and that with every proposal on mistrust or change of election rules, we are becoming more and more narrow-minded parties.
Many times in the last two years, they have advised me to bow my head, not to be so loud and tell me everything will be fine then."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, driven by the neglect of government Margaret Thatcher, who left my school's multidisciplinary classroom to failure, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could have been misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing at Brexit, which will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether it's members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political benefit will deter me from acting the way I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr heading for the summit
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final score, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day at the Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the charts, and the only ones are undefeated by ten teams.
Finally, the ultimate defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we have been tested at every game and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: “Every honor of Ayru, they took advantage of opportunities better than us. ”
The attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute realized by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose the opportunity to score, and Jason Baggott took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayra by eleven before, at the very halftime, he scored a hit and realized an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 in advance of the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggott, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then came the long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott they carried out on the stretchers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game by trying Stafford McDowal, which was realized by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson got the yellow card and Melrose re-forced the extra player to pay, and it was an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to bring down the climate that didn't have the ball; from the line for the penalty shot, MacPherson took the position behind Ayra in full swing of the breakthrough.
Clemo realized, as he had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent by side player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the domestic team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activities
Ford Kiernan, star of Still Game, seems ready to continue working in service after it was discovered that he was appointed director of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series with a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the coming ninth season would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in "a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes that the court will assign her an exit to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the sea center full of cranes in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are winged: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of the lost seashore in favour of Chile during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for the Pacific again.
While Bolivia is awaiting the ruling of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1st, following a five-year trial, hopes may be at the highest level in the past few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A multitude of Bolivians across the country will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here is Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from a verdict Monday.
"We are near the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in the favor of Bolivia and that little would change if that were the case.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after final hearings means that the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have been reprieved.
"The question of access to the sea has adopted the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the dialogue at one point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has taken an unusually fast decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "interrupt 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never deny access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm themselves nuclearly if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during a meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
He made comments at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says sanctions have continued due to "freedom of imagination" and that the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will by no means cast the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pjongyang taking concrete steps to disarm first.
Kim and the president of the United States of America Donald Trump want to hold another summit meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pjongyang to renounce the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of large head coverings is on the road to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your collection of hats or completely cover the sun, do not look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion runway presented the line of unhinged giant head coverings for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have swept Instagram, and these designers have sent out their creations that draw attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was Valentino, and it was a large beige hat decorated with a wide perimeter of feathers that completely took over the model's head.
Other giant accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that giant hats could come to luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly fit with the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a perimeter of about 60 cm wide, seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand behind an extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on a fashion runway sent another great creation – a straw beach bag almost as big as a model wearing a bathing suit.
A extinguished orange Rafi bag, decorated with rivets and a white leather handle, was an exhibited copy in the summer collection of Jacquesmus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stilist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury shops for the next summer. Since the designer has left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore demand for large fashion accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary exam results, with additional weight given by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim at preparing students for further education and higher education, a career they want and making them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired object of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages have been made by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who studied foreign languages received excellent reviews.
The data collected at 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received an excellent Mandarin language rating, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish also received the highest possible rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electoral objects are considered as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming an imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
As language skills are sought in more and more jobs, they are vital in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGoov, in 2013 more than 4,000 adults participated, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know the language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of subjects, more specifically 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are professional in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools provide children with an environment in which they can prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for us.
The fact cannot be overlooked that today's global business is very important for the future of each country so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools
LeBron will play Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first performance for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes it'll take.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told Lakers' official page.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in the Lakers, which consists of six games.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season matches," he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does tonight's Trump rally start in West Virginia, and how can you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time, tonight, Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia is available online via the stream live on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, which sparked controversy over the allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the primary objective of this set of meetings is to help Republicans make the November elections a priority.
Therefore, Trump's headquarters for the presidential campaign report that five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress are so important to the presidents' plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the turbulent campaign," Reuters told Trump's anonymous spokesman.
Tonight's event to be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohija and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. In 2016, Trump won more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in polls," said political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team leaves heart on the ground before individual raids Sunday
After three one-sided sessions of a couple's bust on Sunday afternoon, maybe it's just what was supposed to turn Ryder Cup.
"The wheel of happiness turns around" is a saying that is especially true in sport and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions such as this.
Who's the wheel of happiness now favored?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are still 12 points left to finish the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouraged his game with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after the game.
Spith played lethally from Tee to Green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading cheers grew louder when Spith and Thomas came to two points behind, and it all culminated in the crucial path in which Spith came to an unresolved outcome.
After the road he won the game with 15 holes followed a similar cheering cry in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can reverse everything.
"All you have to do is concentrate and think about your game," said Spieth.
Now that's all that's left for those players.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spith and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a sensation of Ryder Cup.
A European strange but irresistible couple has a maximum score and can't be wrong.
"Molliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a score on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning sequence, as well as the incredible energy connecting Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of Europeans while the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
Maybe both of them will win at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is too early to talk about the Europeans' victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took out Alex Noren and Sergei Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys at the first nine holes in the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they could not dig from.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch games of couples up close because you can see the interactions of players in pairs, hear advice they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed in a moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, in which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans in the last day Ryder Cup enter with leadership from 10: 6
Europeans come in after Saturday games in couples on the last day Ryder Cup with a significant advantage over the US of 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led with four points of difference to Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy that she missed in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs with a score of 3: 1.
The U.S. team has shown greater battle in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
In order to win the Jim Furyk trophy, eight points should be collected in the 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debutante from the European team to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinars, known as "Milliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in a game in couples in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed at Fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and US debutante Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5-4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturdays games made some brilliant moves, but now he has 19 losses of 29 games in footballs and couples and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning furballs to go back to playing with his partner Henry Stanson and to lose 2-1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans did not have everything going as oiled during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting a ladder high for their American team.
First, they defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2-1 in fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4-3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of Ryder Cup the team that was behind four points managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needed an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, it seems Sunday's counterattack will be hard for them.
North Korea announces that "no chance" for unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that further sanctions increase distrust in the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea last year took "significant goodwill measures", for example, halted nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing station and decided to halt nuclear technology and weapons development.
"But we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we have no faith in our national security. Under such circumstances, there is no way that we will disarm the first unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "advanced" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would phase out sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as he had done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first meeting in the history of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the US has conditioned that Pjongjang give up nuclear weapons prior to that.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearising ahead of that and increasing pressure by sanctions to force its goal, and even to oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can cast us on our knees is only a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States spoke about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korea head Moon Jae-in held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearisation had been sought by South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
Regardless of everything, the tone of Minister Ri's speech was largely different from last year's when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after wicked President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea had denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have voiced the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an effort to stop financing the nuclear and ballistic programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompé met with Rio at the UN's main assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him "gangster demands" after several hours.
North Korea has arranged a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has allowed all students to sleep well in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academics found that students at the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical College and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of a course came after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of my class, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find this out just now, in my last year of college? ”
She said no one told her how important the dream is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The first school course this year explains how good sleep habits help students in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and Executive Director of Health Services of the University of Paul Barreira said the University decided to introduce a course after students had experienced a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a dormitory where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important sleep routines are.
During lectures, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus is shown with interactive icons that encourage students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Cheisler added.
The culture of pride on all night learning before exams continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove the lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping also helps fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after attending his first year at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand his course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all diplomats to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit screen electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1: 0: Mengin goal beat Gerrard boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot maimed Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the game with Livingston's 1-0 win.
The guys from Ibrox wanted to win the first guest victory after the triumph in February and result 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now down eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership for lead Hearts.
Menga made the hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have run out of inspiration and didn't seem to equalize the score.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third with only one event of difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after a line judge named Calum Spence got a head injury when a case was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his hips, and so he ran past Ayra to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same set of Livingstone that the Hearts last week took the measure and would be delighted to see how his well-designed set choked every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had the ball in possession more, but Livingstone with it accomplished more.
They had the chance to strike two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game by Scott Pittman's opening room to move toward Allan McGregor's goal, however, the prisoner missed that opportunity.
Deep free strike by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate, Alan Lithgow, could only pass an impeccable blow to the rear row.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have tried him 11 minutes after his 15-minute collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers were able to point only two balls to the goal, but former Ibrox Gater Liam Kelly's one blow to Lassane Coulibaly's head and a pitomial blow to Ovie Ayari was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingstone slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers again missed the deep Jacobs return ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Menga for the simple ending of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett performed one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead at final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide shot out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again sought an 11-year-old because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye this time.
Almanah: The Inventor of Geiger's Count · Global Voices
And now the following page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and several days ago ...day of birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The main pillar of science since that time, Geiger's counter has also become the main pillar of pop culture, for example in the 1950 Bells of Colorado film, where the main roles were seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to the radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system that it recognises bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure involves removing cells of the immune system from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
The cells are being treated so that they can "recognize" the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient, their modification to the laboratory in order to know how to "recognizate" protein called HER2 which is common to many cancers and the re-injecting of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and learning them to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
After visiting Saturday Night Live, Kanye West engaged in discussions about Trump and supported him by wearing a hat with the title "Let's Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was scouted during the Saturday Night Live show following a breakup in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for President 2020.
After performing a third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the title "We Make America Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live issue began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the US Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a video of West speaking on social media was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
You don't know if Rock was trying to make a mockery of West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being transferred behind the stage for the hat he was wearing.
"They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been harassed!
They said I was sunk," passed by Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he was going to wear his Superman cloak because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love."
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused the audience at least twice, and the Saturday Night Live members seemed embarrassed, while one person for the magazine said: “The whole studio has shut down. ”
West was called at the last minute as a replacement for a singer named Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
West performed the song “I love it”, dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirit people: Thank you for resisting the Mafia."
But the broadcast host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was his own and that it is absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”) for whom I believe to accept and disseminate an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he is now "will officially be known under the name Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, which is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and, of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

Star Series Game of the Throne Kit Harrington turned on toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword keeper of the HBO's violent medieval fantasy The King's Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor turned on a stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be firm in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game of the Throne series, admitted that he wants to face this problem "very decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we learned from men as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Keith believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what has been learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, and that makes boys feel like they have to have certain male lines?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not record the sequels to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said he "has finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be playing in a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the recording of the Games of the Throne.
"I met my wife by recording this series, which gave me a family and a future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic show that won the Emmy Award playing the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
Couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change compared to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted across parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, the Chinese health authorities said that persons infected with HIV in this way are almost gone.
Each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
HIV sex transmission is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is said to be high.
Studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of diseases in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to deal with this problem, the Chinese government in 2003 promised to have free access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public staff has given up data on the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Attorney Maxine Walters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published personal data from three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's website.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles assures that these claims are spread by individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as by websites.
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a committee hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of those data belongs to the Waters office, as well as information about the representative staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These groundless allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking those data.
These baseless statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something he didn't do can't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the reaction of Barbara Walters to the criticisms sent by Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing in the general elections against Waters, also responded to Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed "the competent authorities and the authorities of the order" of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Film review "Johnny English: Again on Task" – not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is the same in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel called "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screens "Johnny English is riding again" in 2011.
Will a twisted satire of our own discuss how obviously worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Incompetent Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face again has a complication license, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a wacky undercover agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to the "drunk" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a snorting of Mr Bean's character and somewhat reminds of that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of London's 2012 Olympic Games.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and which is the embodiment of chaos.
There are one or two hot moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "impossible missions" and offer the elements of comedy themselves.
Humor is thought to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, the crazy stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as the Atkinson's dumb egos are embellished in Mr Bean's image.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
The hacker entered the most secret British spy web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an officer on duty, who unfortunately has been playing Kevin Eldon for a short time.
This spilled a glass of Prime Minister's patience, a proud and warlord who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully present a character who should represent Theresa May, but she did not quite get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisors have revealed to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person is going to be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as director of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few hot egos here because English teaches to spy in rock style.
English quickly brings to the government's premises for an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, former partner and their eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an enthusiastic submarine commander by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service, who do everything wrong, return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletov, who was embellished by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, the vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous experiences: disguised as waiters of a fancy French restaurant, a challenge of a huge mess smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht, and English is causing a complete anarchy by trying to use headphones for virtual reality to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything is done as it should for this last sequel, but however attractive and sweeping the film, it still contains a lot of children’s elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I wondered again, could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
Laburist Party denies working out plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week and be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly wants the heads of the workers' companies to pass on the savings achieved by the AI and give them an extra day off.
That would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources have suggested that the idea could "join" the party's economic agenda and plans to favour the interests of workers.
The Union Congress supported the switch to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it is a goal that fits into the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this tendency.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power out of the hands of "blameless directors" and "professors" in utilities.
The shadow of the chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water management companies may not be able to regain their entire stake because the Labour government could make "returns" based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the management boards of the company and to create inclusive ownership funds in order to make 10 per cent of private company capital available to employees, which would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Agency's conclusion can affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI would discover something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they gave you an introduction, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, unmovable, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been carved into a stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should have a strong accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything's changed."
What is Global Citizens Festival and has he achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performing stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project project, an international advocacy group in hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending email to world leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful means of raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizens, really, considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" – where people feel that signing an Internet petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and enforcers in the United Kingdom, which advocates "helping children to develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda with the goal of ending malnutrition in the area.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that the social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition Foundation", an audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult journey
But we will succeed, as well as great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because we are stronger together.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the performances at this year's New York event that will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke said the Russian engagement in Syria is particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those present at an event whose host was a non-profit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, represented in the United States as "a voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, and for Russia, he said it is "serving the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in parallel with Trump's administration's intention to increase the export of its accumulated natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, made Berlin "the prisoner" of Moscow.
On a number of occasions, Moscow stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position sparked a reaction by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says state senator Massachusetts
Federal Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the candidacy for president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman at the head," The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I am terribly concerned that Donald Trump is doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think that 2020 should run.
According to a study by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, 50 per cent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of votes for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
The other prominent names of the Democrat discussed in connection with the potential race for President 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after applying for September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of family violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, is comparable to other families that feel the effects of PTSD and other wounds with which our soldiers are returning," said the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he kept quiet about both his son and other veterans of war said that they were "returning a little differently, returning hard, returning, wondering whether they had any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, gave to this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with family violence against a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Police Department of the City of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the county submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" had abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing widespread gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014, allowing non-documented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
National Attorney of Columbia Karl Racine said in his statement Friday that the new policy "ignorates decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum claims are resolved on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the action, and such an obstacle violates that principle," the Court's friend's report states.
Lawyers have further argued that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "safeguard the necessary labour".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on policy on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusum, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palou.
‘Emergency vehicles shall be imported by the authorities at any minute.
The government has a shortage of clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, reading through flooded items, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were loaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who suffered a fracture of his back and shoulders, rested outside the Palou Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the open for continuous severe ex post-shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "trembling" by means of "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long ad in the American daily newspaper, which promoted the mutual benefit of the U.S. and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid newspaper supplement in the most sold newspaper in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6th U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials described as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has harmed US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in Sunday's newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles it by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free print by putting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newsstand in the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will see no true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media is under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were involved.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans distanced voters from mid-term elections, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand by the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very upset, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday
On Friday morning, the protestors sang, "The Novembers are coming!", witnessing in the Senate Hall while Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond expectations," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst.
"People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by the candidates for the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest there might be a negative reaction if the Republicans continue to confirm.
"It is a real mess for the Great Old Party," said Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also the way Republicans approached it and treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priority Organisation, a group that helps in choosing Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided over who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new survey published by YouGoov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe or probably believe in the truthfulness of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations Ford made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for Supreme Court Judge showed her genitals at a party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, commitment lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision on who can access what information completely users can access.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project contract, as well as community of voluntary developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to make their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would turn overnight completely.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a statement published at Media Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solida".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Reverence of World War I by Victoria Cross · Global Voices
The celebration of the only priest of the Church of England who was decorated with Victoria as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the September 29th 1918 award in the attack on Bellengelise and Lehoucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honour.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “unbelievably symbolic ” that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s conquest of that recognition.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across St Quentin's channel "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from a battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed into the front row and, with “amazing courage, ” led the unit forward before, without any help, rushing onto the Polish cannon and maiming three of the military squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something that I know I could never accomplish, and that encourages humility. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Lovers of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Peppa instead.
Imagine this, stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be prevented from following the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they appeared live at night on channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Britain remained in shock when the broadcast interrupted Prashčić Peppa.
Many were not even impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning because of the struggle.
One fan described the interruption of children's cartoons on Twitter as "a sick joke".
"According to the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to transfer it to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for Bellator marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Yupi, "Peppa's Bug."
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would coordinate his schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I consider replaying, I think we can probably work something out," said Coker.
"But the transmission is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes, when Monday will be with them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut off, there were many correspondences that weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a matter of state nature.
I can promise you next time it won't come to that.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six or so that's what we're doing.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was unaware that "not everyone is like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights in order to give others "hope".
He also said victory at the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off for illness.
Appearing as an outlaw on the first Laverne show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity with respect to others have been the real things that have given me power and strength so that I can succeed. ”
He says he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double champion of the bronze Olympic Medals has become a prominent person who advocates LGBT and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised to be in love with a man
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him, last year, but said that his age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young, you go through so much" he referred to his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone the same age and had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the story would have been about having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than golden Olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London 2012.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"All I knew was that what I had dreamed of my whole life jumping in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games was not a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio on Sunday 4 at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to return to full form to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who played the record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk on the bench in a Saturday game with four balls and a quarter.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and working out his game at the gym in hopes of correcting what torments him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for a demanding terrain Le Golf National, where a long rough terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the terrain itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is facing the British Open-Franco Molinari's precision champion, Tommy Fleetwood, who won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, which 12 individual matches start with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There is a lot of confidence."
He's famous and he's contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record Sunday by number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy for the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual matches Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward race.
The Danish debuted in Valderram in 1997, where the team of Captain Seven Ballesteros had the advantage of five points compared to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a close difference from 141⁄2 .131⁄2.
"You are constantly reminded that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a narrow difference," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the team 2018. which won the 5
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play full force.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors on the board come out.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very well aware of who's standing opposite us, the biggest players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run ahead of the ore in this.
Tomorrow it's time to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main single performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with your partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, you're at the ultimate test of your golfer skills.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, and she's saying that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other hand, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those major twists on the last day, since he was part of the Brooklyn victory team before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that rush starts in a certain direction, he puts a lot of pressure on middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our show and set up the boys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys would go in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship put back on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war, but will not be ready at least until next year due to faulty systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the completely new class frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit's newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery affected the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad, will be obsolete by the time it enters the service, Die Zeit noted.
The unfortunate frigate F125 reached all the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "soft and hardware flaws" that would make a warship useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important because Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will manage a crew of about 120 sailors half the size of Bremen class frigates.
Also, the ship has proved to be dramatically too heavy to reduce its effectiveness and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh more than 7,000 tonnes twice the class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project
It is said that the price has reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is actually "depriving ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as the old ships were put out of service and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigate class Baden-Württemberg could join the Navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of the Bat
New research carried out on the Scottish Highland estate aims to discover how bats use their landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will be followed by ordinary and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-skinned and river bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat vote and what kind of person does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the protection of the nature of NTS, hopes to discover what habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Triave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats inhabiting Scotland.
The warden, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"We have a huge bat space here in Threeave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there is much more that we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us to understand better what they need to make progress."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance works inside buildings, since unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of Scotland's Bat Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and many of our species simply do not know how their population is progressing. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges brought against him as "false news", saying people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker was charged with rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the indictment was filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the allegations as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
"They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine," the football player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable privacy allegations," Reuters said.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in amounts corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
It is reported that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in the hotel and the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to their soccer room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 per cent" was a "good guy" betrayed by that "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that he was agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and have photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100m-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will "forever regret" that they have lost car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if after Brexit loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of waiting at borders in the case of Brexit without agreement could result in job losses.
The Burnaston Drive, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain emerges from the EU without an agreement at the end of March, we will experience production stalls in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK voiced fears about leaving the EU without agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without the agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the principle "just in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota at her factory in Derbyshire could not hold more supplies than those needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to agree. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only the maintenance of the current success, but also the use of this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 programme today said.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful supply chain."
In Toyota they could not tell how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the Unit's Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, after your business is gone, they never come back."
The government spokesman says, "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight on the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the links between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire the deputy state's attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has been spreading gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was debating the wearing of wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News TV.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would contest the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not a consequence of the aversion to "theatral behavior" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are scattered."
She then suggested direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organises more meetings to answer questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
A brief address will continue to happen, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to raise a direct question to the President of the United States, it is endlessly better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible often, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and it is precisely that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short-talking to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland because of the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and her desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to relive how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Line player Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury Saturday's defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a score of 31
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came to the line of the playground and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put it on the stretcher and sent it to further searches.
A representative of Tennessee State State State State University told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no "detail of the type/range of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of acting internship, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five shoot-outs before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shoot-outs in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
That step will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
An increase in fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters to promises that it will provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with higher salaries.
An increase in fees will be charged by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee which is charged to the current fee, including an increase that was introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the issue can be up to three percent.
The treasury expects the move to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy their first real estate to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country have become “Ghost Cities” especially in the capital, because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut in order to help a greater number of young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable properties to fix the "phastly situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of nothing-prone deposits.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes easily as valuable British people.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for many people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his "endless ambition" became Scotland's manager one day.
Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading ones.
This summer, he moved to the Lights Stadium after reinstated St. Mirren at the Scottish Football Championships last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could still come true only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's post, including Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paul Di Cania.
Former Chief Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel scared because he inherits so famous names at such a big club after previously refusing calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross is only finishing his third year of management career, following a period during which he was the assistant head in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from her third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of falling to the champions of the championship of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkark, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Alloe recalled.
"I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I've done well, made good money and enjoyed quite successful times.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finance, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars increased revenue in July by 2.7 per cent, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the fine weather and the participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, with the fact that restaurants were now even more affected.
A fall of 1.8 percent in the revenues of the restaurant in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where they mainly serve drinks have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions than the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mainly served also suffered heat, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for rest and catering, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the greatest factors when it comes to selling on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to cope with difficulties, although the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-serving localists, and time would show whether the moderater temperatures we experienced in August would provide the necessary rest."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the share of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of more than £9 billion, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One out of five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
News has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that shows to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, opens secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey covering 20,000 high school students showed a rapid rise in the number of "false Insta" accounts
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they were using a clean "main" bill to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to "rap me".
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) has shown that 40 per cent of students aged 11-18 have two profiles, half of which admits to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be "a voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as executive director at the annual Governing Body Assembly.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are leading sports to take advantage of her wide experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American who won a 200-400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, after a transitional ischaemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would show if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today for the sake of practice of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Shared opinions on online advertising for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
A company for producing traitors by advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed their children to cows that the husband is motivated by shared opinions on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product claimed to be "the first silently worn traitor in the world", Elvie for consumer technology published an advertisement inspired by ironic music video to show the freedom that the new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that says, "Yes, I husband myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a joke, these are my breasts."
Then the chorus follows: “Push out, pump out, feed the baby, pump out, pump out, husband of my lady. ”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed viewer reactions, and many say it illuminating the "sacrifice" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie Betrayer is discreetly blending into breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comments: “Sensibly traumatic for a mother and a child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A totally lame commercial."
Others defended the ad, admitting that her song was “smiley. ”
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The production of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a genius product," she said.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial directed at mothers who give milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like a ‘cow’.
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who give milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie’s traitor, however, is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breastplate, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “The traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus our attention on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's traitor got on the cover.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly transferred to tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children under sponsoring.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were nondocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested earlier had not been recorded in criminal records.
"It is almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the home of the country's sponsors are illegal, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
So we are continuing our search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, with a view to speeding up the process for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier the standard.
Many will appear through a videoconference call, not in person, so that they will present their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who fail to meet the criteria for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to the statements of the workers at the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
Proponents said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs of the child being tortured will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupationary forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Moalem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011, while millions had lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "the spread of irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces, with Russia's support on the province of which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including the Nusr front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new board composed of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for the elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump should win the re-election in 2020 unless, to what many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and scandal soon end his presidency.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of viewer fatigue right now.
Since 2014, the outlook in the peak period has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike terms, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast surpassed ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings broadcasting the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designed Survival" drama about the secretary of government who becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied: “Because it makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories that come from Washington can determine the future of the law on abortion, which is the result of Roe v. Wade's procedure, whether immigrant families can reunite themselves and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you are beyond the level of informed citizens when you find yourself watching for six hours now a group of experts debate how Bob Woodward used deep background sources for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's coat of ostrich skin worth $15,000 (a clothing object full of lardiness), says Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this one, of Mr Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he does to you as a reality show is that he feeds you on something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the show "The pawnshop", about the rotating acting set and the daily complications of Trump's show (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you'll be behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He could not separate himself from the TVs, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside pours into the most uncertain mid-term election race for the congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the remodeling of the congressional districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reorganized neighbourhood of Pittsburgh's suburban section highlights Democrat Conor Lamba, who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the 17th district.
Cards were drawn again after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally reduced in favour of Republicans.
In the new 17th district, the race launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party fund-raisers, the Committee collecting funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored special March elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. values are to be punished by El Salvador for supporting China, and then retreating.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked off Trump's organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "a recent decision not to recognise Taiwan," said spokesman Heather Nauert.
However, the sentences were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated $140 million of US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Middle American country and the high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to continue a similar gathering last year, which was considered a breakthrough in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and that in fact ended any consideration of the punishments for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing is a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump's obstruction of justice, about which there is now very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to step forward again before the voters, and maybe eventually and jury to him straight.
There are many of those "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trum's inevitable fall is not like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike against Hitler, only to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or is late.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflation.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that last year he secretly proposed recording the president and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that will call Mr Trump to account?
If we fail on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're gonna fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once served in my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with the chicken cross.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive rally in Spain against Villarrel early this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented the bearer Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2 . . 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the score as a stepping stone for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and pulled the point.
Maybe at the end we could've stolen the game, but in general, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but we were better at the second.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive score.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's some good feeling.
The guys are good and the guys are really enjoying themselves; training's good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of the study students said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of National Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your adviser can also help you to come up with a way to pay these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth
Prepare your legal documents: Stop legal battles in the root.
Engage healthcare professionals to determine a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not in a position to do so.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide details in your written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected.
Since the communications were terminated, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the province of Donggala, areas north of Palua that are closer to the quake epicenter of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palau after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches over 300 km of coast in the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggal have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is detained by Mat-Su and retains on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said, "innocently, of course," the network reported on a plea of guilt.
Palina is charged with three class A violations, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and fined with a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable on one prison day and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that criminal charges were filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the 2016 Veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palou when tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saip, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack a cycling track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mutilated pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a notification of the intention to seek the death penalty, which was imposed in the southern district of New York.
Both points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with a court order.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of Saip hit a 22-point charge that included eight counts of murder and extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci”, is mentioned in the intention notice.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern County of New York last tried a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he wasn't guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept a confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A conservative member of parliament says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the National Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptic since one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone told the Birmingham Marches that the United Kingdom would "come out" that Mr Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in the reconciliation of her deep-separated ranks is to stress the Tory's retreating remnants that join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of a Brexit supporters, a survivor and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction of . . and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "kaos".
Mr Bone said at the "Leave Mens Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wants to "refuse Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
A Wellingborough Parliament member added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Addressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Conservative and supporter of Brexito Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, speaking to journalists: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a note to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises. ”
Farage told the group that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are about to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'that's not gonna work out for you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-righteous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remnant marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally downtown.
Many activists waved banners "Torijci v. Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada plus plus" plan, for the smooth state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a close association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's been at the centre of speculation for some time now so that Trump 2020 can be opposed.
Saturday afternoon's meeting at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman in charge."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of the state University of Louisiana (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims, who took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released the video of the murder, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims won a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and possessing the weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 sets last season and on average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vette
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team's order would "play a great role in the race".
From its initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two rounds and urging Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel on the wheel, causing Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in defense of the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while relying on his tires to reach a fast finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
Finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walttery's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he's a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has done a truly remarkable job of performing a formation finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad speech from the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's rally for insisting that she did not release a letter to the public from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly deal with Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate had proved that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information into the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answers... did you release the document to the public - 'aah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story in public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for."
However, her denial was not met with approval by the president, who commented at the Saturday evening meeting: “Let me tell you something — it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the president said, broadcasts Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for the defeat of Belfast Giants in Elite League Friday's victory in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5
In the early minutes, the Giants took advantage of two goals by hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillelier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two naked Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and beat Dundee with a score of 2 . . . 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., with Kendall McFaulle's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead with the Beauvilleier shot four minutes later.
In the early opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt made it possible for Cowney to be equal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with leadership when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped, and Bouchard once again brought them to an equalization in the score of strength naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee first at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team had already been halfway to victory in the last third game.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, hosted teams from Milton Keynes in the next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died as he secured the safe take-off of aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are reported missing after a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower that rocked strongly.
It remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was coming down.
He passed away later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reports.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balipan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palua.
"Our heart is breaking because of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the state agency for disaster relief says it is limited access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to increase, as many bodies are still under rubble and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Pala, where a mass burial would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove the ambulance every minute of the body's import.
The government has a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is led as a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
An aircraft company that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is running as a missing person, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, I cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person concerned.
The aircraft company did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane flew very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to break through the water that reached their waist to the exit in case of a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted and suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said the sailors who worked nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue by using a boat to blow people up to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people have died, but none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst exposes the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded the trial Saturday in a retrial of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described him using cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was obtained from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he "had lied because his truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, erased her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.

The High Breed singer group from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and hip-hop make it popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl? !
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from a mother who calls her "another black woman".
Couples deny they're racists, comparing the charges with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day 2016, she learned that she was a new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
"NEEE ANOTHER BLACK GIRL," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her wife's note.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "uncomfortable" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, for claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, was in a bad position, and that she had been expecting the Filipino instead, was transferring the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and requesting a refund of $350 a day for a period of six months for which she was initially engaged, though without a contract.
"I want to show them I can't do such things," the Post said Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that the racists, saying that ending Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing to do because of the fear that they would not be able to believe her later on.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to whom you have been rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in her letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success."
Saying that her father, who worked as the BBC's cameraman before a tiny stuffed bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of publishing books was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite these men and was not a boaster," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it all happened as some achievement of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your work.
I think Paddington's success has been observed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad and believe it would not get away," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications her doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate were slowly losing effect and leaving her body system.
She died just before boarding, and that's when it all went out.
All I had to do was sit here and wait and know what would happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of grieving women on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with a contagious smile waiting for a bright career.
"They all remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
Before his death, however, he left work because he was “in a truly dark state. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found a brother after he had taken his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that this will have a negative effect. ”
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards “to make people know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence ? You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies's, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom when the children opened the presents, didn't look them in the eye or want anything else."
She said that his death was a great trauma, but she had to cope with it: “All of this leaves a large hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the end as the FBI investigates it.
"I thought that we might bring in a bit of unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for in the time and scope of a limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the board was "disintegrating" in the middle of a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their discomfort is driven by the choice of moments.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th if the Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be seriously weakened in trying to bring the desired man to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush repeatedly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
It will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea's 'pace' led by Kim
The number of refugees from North to South Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to data from the U.S. ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 refugees last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors of stricter control at the border crossing between North Korea and China and the more charges the smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't make a public comment.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
The relations between the North and the South
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnant denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, a North Korean foreign minister, blamed US sanctions on not making any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is out of the question that we are the first to disarm ourselves under such circumstances," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric", says he is incapable of service in the Supreme Court.
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called a candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that because of his temperament, he was incapable of service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would call herself 'histeritic'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school age.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats on the board, calling the charges against him "grotesque and co-ordinated defamation" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosy said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court's work, because he showed that he had prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if he'd try to call Kavanaugh off if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi quit.
"I'll say the following if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not able not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Act on Accessory Care or the Law on the Derogation of the Procurator of Roe v. Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh went over the question of whether he would remake some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that has been gathering for months and years, cannot be rid of it without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Stein said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “I was greatly assisted by a woman who was formerly executive director and who said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘ You may think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated me, was that, on one occasion when I cried for unspeakable anger, an elderly woman
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them Snow White and seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already advanced, it was lagging behind in fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, by frustration over the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and by anger over sexism that her throat shook.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalled a media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what he'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The start of a trade war between the United States and China has been loudly echoed and, while the battle is far from the end, discord between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new duties that have affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned each time in some way, and a recent customs duty of between five and ten percent on 60 billion dollars of American goods has been introduced.
China has promised that the United States will respond with a blow, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not give up soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by making demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, US trade war pressures can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic collapse in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a strategic think tank focused on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, said foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild the country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could benefit from helping rebuild the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept parole or help from the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5
The United States has so far lost six in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again conquered the crown as the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling during almost the entire tournament, at 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball to the water at the first shot, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
American Jordan Spitha kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranked European team player, with 5-4.
Best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost two and one of Englishmen Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became European with the most winning tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the Cup again.
I am happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won a legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2-1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics from one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, are right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been fighting all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get ahead of ourselves. I'm gonna work with PGA America and our board of Ryder Cups, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to people.
We're out. We're out."
New data on the red tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasoti
The latest report by the Fish Conservation Commission and the Florida Plant and Animal World (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of red tides in the Tampa Bay Gulf.
According to the FWC, the conditions of heterogeneous alga blooming are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Areas of flowering can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
The red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
During the past week, the average concentrations in the Pinellas county or in the surrounding coastal area, low to high concentrations in the Boroughs district of Hillsborough, common to high concentrations in Manatee district, common to high concentrations in the Sarasota district or associated coastal area, common to the average concentration in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in Lee County or associated coastal areas, and low concentrations in Collier County, have been recorded during the week.
Cases of irritability of the respiratory system continue to be reported in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
