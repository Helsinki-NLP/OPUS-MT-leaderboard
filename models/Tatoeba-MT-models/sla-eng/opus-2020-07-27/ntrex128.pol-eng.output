Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be called Muppets
This is the result of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea was created by plans to change the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of kpin.
One of the Labour Party parliamentarians expressed concern about his grouping, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: in Welsh the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means departures.
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party said that its grouping was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Valiant Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. He noted, however, that the word "mWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced in the English dialect "u" in the same way as the letter "u".
The committee currently working on the draft law amending the name adopted the following position in the assembly: “The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them.”
The Law of Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the change of Parliament's meeting to Wales received wide support.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of members of the Assembly to “Member of the Welsh Parliament”, or the WMP in English, although the shortcut “MP” enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
Members of the assembly propose alternative solutions: difficulties in reaching consensus are a disaster for Elin Jones, chairman of the assembly, who should present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principles of recalling members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On the coming Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon be named as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help greet the decades-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, in which the region is called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbour is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly objected to attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on change of name, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The calls in the New York Church of St. Marcin are silent in connection with the problems of Churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that a bar and a church could be found on every corner," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Up to date, people are giving out their company in a different way," he noted.
"Bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community."
In the case of churches, he is concerned, however, that the funds from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe and that they “will sooner or later be at the point of departure”.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartmenters inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in such buildings will be white, and this will accelerate the complete closure of churches, since it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the assembly of white believers before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (St. Marcin's church joined the community a decade later).
The first gathering of white Methodists left the area during the 1930 ’ s.
The African - American District Assembly then took over the property right of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by a meeting led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing employment or promotion of African Americans.
Fire from 1939 greatly damaged the building, but the parishioners of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell band.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcin’s church, proudly called the new carillon “the poor. ”
The expert who knocked at the bells in July described them in a different way as “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that this was the world's first carillonium to be supported by black music. The artist was Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's church had not replaced him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events involving architects and performers at St. Marcin’s church, some of whom have been brought to the scene by church leaders and some by the Episcopal Church diocese.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) directed its concerns to diocese, claiming that it “wants to throw costs on the council”, although the council did not take part in the recruitment of architects and performers sent on the spot.
Some parishioners also complain of lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Shark injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The event occurred on the first day of season for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, U.S.A.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends, they set out to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he thought the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely torn skin around the collar.
“I began to scream at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego. His condition was classified as critical.
The shark species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier. However, it was found that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
In order to carry out the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca until Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live nearby, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's shop network plans to expand its activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws gloves at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, bringing into their supermarkets cosmetics that connect in style to stores, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly growing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household products, 11 online stores will have larger racks with cosmetic products. If the initiative succeeds next year, the action will be extended to more points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to build the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer as many as 3 thousand articles. In the assortment, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. Pawpaw will appear.
Currently sold articles of brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its product offer for Boutique makeup. From now on most articles will be friendly to vegans, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the Perfum Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first one opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second one will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops makes supermarkets more encouraging customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President of Sainsbury's, said that sales points would increasingly resemble freight houses because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced a number of Habitat sites since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food products and increased profitability of investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise compartments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
In the early 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, cooperation ended following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from drug companies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's launches a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the Lloyds report, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing an extended offer of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance and character of cosmetics departments in order to improve the impressions of customers.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to focus on customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the existing ways of shopping."
Peter Jones "frightened" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, star of the Dragons' Den television program, was "angry" when he found out Holly Willoughby was planning to withdraw from £11 million worth of lifestyle brand to focus on newly related collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items named Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a prosperous lifestyle brand and focus on newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV taken by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million, there would be no time to devote their brand offering accessories and household articles to Trula.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand. It was also intended to double Holly Willoughby's assets estimated at £11 million.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave Truly by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram Peter Jones left Great Britain, going to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied up with her future and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, and it was so close to entering the market.
In Marlow Store there are goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of this Morning and one of the most successful stars in the United Kingdom may cost a company millions of pounds due to significant investment in products – including articles from pillows to candles and household articles – and will also lead to further delay in entering the market.
It may also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship for ten years with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby, together with Tara Capp, founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
Couples spent vacations together, and Jones included 40% of the shares in the television production company belonging to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McCorlin as the host of programme I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the attention that some considered "unsuitable husband of the state" as well as a positive attitude towards North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a funny voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was shouted by Trump for a large step towards North Korean denuclearisation.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an "analogic response" from the United States to the early North Korean disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States instead maintained sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions would die.
Now we're having a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had positive effects: they ended rocket tests, helped free the hostages and returned to the rest of the American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It is easy to act after the President. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crowded stadium we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered right in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of Lombok residents, the authorities have not announced a natural disaster, which is a condition necessary to accelerate international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support. Therefore, the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the National Natural Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Pal to see if international organisations should be allowed to help.
In the face of shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters were built in the province of Aceh in case of tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of siren warning against tsunamis in Pal – despite issuing a warning – is likely to have an impact on the number of fatalities.
Even under the most favourable conditions travel between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, is going to help the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Vidodo made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funds to the roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the President's administration is facing a lack of resources.
Moreover, Joko Vidodo was under pressure because of the ongoing religious tension in the country, and members of the majority Muslim community took a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins a draw goal in a Chelsea match
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in English Prime Minister League, winning the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a dose of Xherdan Shaqi at approximately 27 metres from the Chelsea Gate at 1-0 to the disadvantage of his team.
Before giving the shot to the remote gate, he moved the ball to the left leg.
The ball moved high above the penalty field towards the right upper corner of the net.
Then she came to the gate, flying over the pitcher by Kepa Arizabalaga.
“I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to move it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best chance to shoot” said Sturridge in a interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed Kantega approaching, took the ball and fired the shot without further ado."
Chelsea ran 1:0 in the middle of the match at the gate of the Belgian star, Eden Hazard, shot 25 minutes ago.
The Blue Attacker kicked the ball with the heel to Mateo Kovacicia and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly accepted administration in the middle of the field.
Then he performed a beautiful advance game in the punishment field back to Hazard.
Gambled ahead of the defenders, and with his left foot, he turned towards the long pole of the shot, which passed over Liverpool's goalkeeper, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli in a group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country increased to 832.
During the conference, the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho announced that as a result of the Friday earthquake, the force of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C] on Richter was trapped under the rubble. In addition, the earthquake caused a tsunami of 6 metres high.
The city of Palu, inhabited by more than 380,000 people, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
After finding a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead County, Merseyside, there was an investigation into a murder case.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious event.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of Investigation, said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I want to appeal to all the people who are then near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also refer to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose registries could have fixed useful materials during the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, those who claim to know a woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police reported that he was in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.
The taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews tried to get into the apartment building recently, but was informed by the police that the entrance to and leaving the facility is currently forbidden.
He was ignoring it when he found out what happened.
Residents were just informed that they would not be able to return to their homes in the near future.
It was heard that one of the officers explained to the men that the area was currently considered a crime scene.
There was a woman crying at the scene.
She kept saying, "It's so horrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars in the area, and another police vehicle was parked next door.
Inside the separated zone, officers guarding the residential building are staying.
Persons with information are requested to contact Twitter (@MerPolCC) or telephone number 101, or to make an anonymous application through Crimestoppers with the number 0800 555 111, indicating event number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's monument to the British Parliament is the last victim in a dispute about "writing history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the similar acts of the Taliban to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanic supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
Indignant actions during the English domestic wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps, for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, the age before was determined to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on a monument shows how happy this 19th - century policy was and that for many people it is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview for The Sunday Telegraph: “Many Cromwell people saw Cromwell — perhaps more often in the 19th century than now — as an advocate of parliament against external pressure.
The assessment of how good this statement is, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord of the Protector also deserve to be honored and remembered."
In China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, there was a fatal attack on the farmer at the Southwest China trade fair.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan had been found bleeding and with a severed artery near the barn in Lipupanshui, Kuejczou Province.
Pig farmer is preparing for vaccination in the barn on 30 May 2005, the town of Xining, in Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, a man came to the fair with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found a man’s body and noticed an open door to a nearby barn.
He said there was a large millet in the bread with blood on the rim.
The body section confirmed that it was about 250 kilos of pig that killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and distraught,” said a man named Wu quoted by Guyang Evening News.
You can see on the camera footage that Yuan came to the fair Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager said in a report for Guyyang Evening News that at the time of the gathering of evidence by the police the police were isolated in order to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the male family and the trade authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Pig attacks against humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal injuries.
Ten years ago in Wales, nearly a 300-pound pig drove a farmer into a tractor, and the men's wives managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can unleash brutal behavior.
"They just want to have fun.
They're as witty as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
Remains after the hurricane of Rosa will cause heavy rains in the south-west of the United States
It is estimated that hurricane Rosa is losing its grip by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause heavy rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa lives at speeds of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 East Time it was given category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punt Eugenia in Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific of Peace is beginning to form rather than heading east on the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will be approaching the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving wet air masses northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall up to 25 cm in height in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the following days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the coming lower will cause rain in the South West of the United States.
In some places, rainfall from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, pollution and possible landslides.
Wet tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour somewhere. This is particularly true of parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the South West of the United States, especially over a large part of Arizona.
In view of the widespread nature of tropical rains, there may be sudden floods and sudden changes in conditions.
In the face of tropical rain, walking in the wilderness is strongly discouraged.
Rich rains can change canyons in the river’s roar, and lightning storms can cause local wind and dust movements.
Coming before it brings abundant local rains on the coast of southern California.
Rain is possible with a total height above 1,3 cm, which may cause small movement of pollutants and road hazards.
This would be the first rainfall of this rainy season in the region.
Spring tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. Monday afternoon and Tuesday, the rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur.
This can lead to extreme temperature changes at low distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (St. Missouri) and Omaha (St. Nebraska) and St. Louis (St. Missouri) and Des Moines (St. Iowa) these differences amount to almost 10 degrees Celsius.
During the coming summer days, temperatures may rise again.
In a large part of the Central and Eastern United States, warm early October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the north east.
On Tuesday in New York the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of excessive temperatures occurring in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh auditions
More than 20 million people watched six television stations addressing Thursday's hearing of a judge at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt the regular programmes to inform them of the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the shadow court committee that he's 100% sure that Kavanaugh was missing her in a state of imprudentity and was trying to take her clothes off during a high school event.
In his emotional statement Kavanaugh said, however, that he was convinced that this was not the case.
It is possible that Friday's number of TV broadcasters was even higher than that of Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC broadcasters.
However, no figures were yet available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring viewership among people at workplaces.
This number is close to watching American Football Cup games or awarding American Film Academy awards.
According to reports Nielsen Fox News Channel Station, which was strongly supported by Kavanaugh's nomination, was the highest viewer, on average 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing.
In second place was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing was closed.
Jeff Flake became a key feature of Friday's events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the tape, he screamed at demonstrators who had made his entrance to the elevator difficult for a court hearing.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to the unfeeling opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you and I'm asking.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women's infirmities," he heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued a proper statement and that he would testify during the commission's hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending the vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which the minority of Democrats insisted on.
Flake was convinced after a part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and a few other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI's investigation into charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In a week's interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union to play the future of Britain and undermine national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (United Kingdom), September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked the plan of future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could collect duties on their behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims' shooting: police arrested Dytheon Simpson, a LSU player's murder suspect
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports by the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was detained and detained on second-degree murder charges.
The authorities released the footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a related CBS station, WAFB police officers found these glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson after questioning that he had confessed to the murder of Wade.
According to the detained lawyer, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that resulted in a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Police Command expressed its gratitude to the search team of the state police, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
A 198-inch man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 matches.
Friday morning, a basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said the team was "scrambled" and "stricken" by Wade's death.
"It's one of the things we're constantly afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ashes emitted by volcano reach the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from the volcano Popocatépetl reached southern parts of the capital city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention prevented Mexicans from approaching the volcano due to increased short-term activity and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre recorded numerous aches and shocks.
The images published in social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the Mexican districts such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1 degree earthquake that visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase of 72 km to the south east of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has remained active since 1994.
The start of police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six persons were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the old protesters supporting Catalonia's independence with the police's preventive forces. On that day, thousands participated in the hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extreme emotion referendum on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked supporters of separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust usually caused streets full of tourists.
The old man was also in the later part of the day, and to stop the fighting, the police used the baton.
For several hours, the independent groups chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive." The opposers of the secession shouted, "Let Spain live."
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries during the protests.
After the end of the year of the referendum on October 1st, tensions do not wane. Although the authorities in Madrid found them illegal, it is still a cause for celebration for the wanted Catalonian secession.
The majority voted in favour of independence, but the turnout was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in brutal seniors with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration of police support.
Despite this, the demonstration was forced to change the route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in a separatist protest, said that there was no hope of independence for Catalonia.
"Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our life.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point without leaving," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalonia secession have difficulty continuing their activities. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic recording a police-supporting protest by phone, said politicians on both sides are fueling conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his wish to launch next year's elections to the European Parliament.
"Contesting to the European Parliament in elections is the best way to condemn the Spanish government's democratic value crisis," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested following several car crashes in a Londonderry house.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 a.m. in British Time (BST).
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, there could also be a shot from the crossbow.
Mengi Gate provides Livingstone win over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Mengi's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
Since this season in the Extracurriculars, the Livingston Club has put the Rangers in shock, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches at the Ibrox Park club coach's position.
Dolly Mengi's gate proved to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in a table occupied with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team is not winning this season at the Premiership. On next Sunday, the team faces the Hearts leader, who loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA League.
Livingstone continues to win a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not failed to replace Kenny Miller in his last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against undisposed opponents
Holt's team was supposed to be running much earlier, because the team's game has caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson struck through the defense and fired a shot at the light of the gate, but he failed to shoot a goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the gate, knowing they could threaten the rivals during the constant parts of the game.
And that's how the decision-making gate fell.
After giving the Rangers a free throw, Livingston's team found an opportunity, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created a situation for Mengee, who scored in the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more assets, but they could not force the hosts to force their defenses, and they did not cause any more trouble for the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's attempt was selected by the Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to reach the light of the gate from another permanent fragment tried for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued to attack the Livingstone criminal field, but they could not take advantage of the situation. In both cases, two executions of Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton's shapeshifter and one handplay were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasair Lamont with BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great show and score for Livingstone.
In his opinion, they played splendidly, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition are almost unchanged from return to extraclass. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a finely organized defense. Menga, however, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Even though they have great moments under Gerrard's leadership, they didn't keep their standards in the game.
In their game there seemed to be something missing: only once managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers who were on the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (September 29th) Turkish and German leaders were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany. Visits aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Colony, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks outside of their homeland.
As the police said, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd was blocked from the temple, but the president's supporters gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt policies in the country.
On the contrary, the protests reflect the divisions of the visit of a politician who was called a hero by a part of the Turks living in Germany and considered to be an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died as a result of car crash
A cyclist was killed after a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the crowded intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescue workers arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago on Childers Street (about a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident) there was another fatal accident involving a cyclist.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the officers were working to identify the deceased man and to inform the members of the family about the incident.
Roads were closed and bus trips were organised, and drivers were ordered to avoid a nearby area.
Long Lartin Penalty: Six officers suffered injuries as a result of riots
According to the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a male prison with a higher level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire began on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) and continues to exist.
Eight prisoners in one of the factory’s wings were called on by a specialist unit, Tornado, to start a riot.
The on-site officers sustained minor facial injuries.
He said: “The HMP Long Lartin criminal activity involved specially trained staff.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the plant had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October of last year, the plant was called on by prevention units because of the dangerous housing in which workers were attacked by pool balls.
The sudden floods caused by the hurricane of Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may have a beneficial impact on drought areas)
Tropical depression is rarely expected to reach Arizona's state. It is likely that this will occur at the beginning of next week. The remnants of Rosa's hurricane are moving in the desert areas of the South West, creating a threat to the sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden floods Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, rain will begin.
National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) reached a distance of 65 km from the state border of Arizona".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mojollon Rome in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm high.
In the rest of the desert areas of the South West, including in the middle Rockies and the Great Basket, the rainfall is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For those outside the areas threatened by sudden floods, the rainfall associated with hurricane Rosa can bring relief, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, part of the rainfall will improve the situation in the Southwest, where drought occurs.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona's area will be faced with the touching droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the peninsula of California, Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to travel with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. Currently, it is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, which causes it to weaken.
It is projected to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major flood risk.
The portal weather.com reported that “in the area from the peninsula of California to the northwest of the state of Sonora, rainfall is expected from 7 to 15 cm, although it can reach 25 cm.”
Then hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning, she will reach the state border of Arizona as tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, she will stop to the southern part of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very abundant rainfall on the peninsula of California, in the northwest state of Sonora and in the southwest desert areas of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are forecast to cause life-threatening floods and pollution in the desert and mud avalanches in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was transferred to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in Radstock.
Officers shall request contact with all persons with video footage of the event.
Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh "spent anger and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voice cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the council in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “spent the anger and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the convention, and he strongly and emotionally denied the charges against Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that several decades ago, when both were teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that the day "Americans could find out about the brilliance, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice cast on Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, an expert in the law of great merit for the community," he said before a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in half the presidential elections.
"We are five weeks apart from the most important choices in our lives.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump claims that Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resisting and obstructing activities".
As CNN said, one of the assistants of an important Republican party policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
On Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were abducted by high waves crashing over the beaches, following severe earthquakes and tsunamis that visited the Indonesia island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, in Palo, hundreds gathered on the beach to participate in the festival city. At dusk, waves of up to 6 meters high hit the coast, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When there was a threat yesterday, the people on the beach did not immediately escape and fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for natural disasters BNPD, at a conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami attacked everything in its path by grabbing cars, logs and houses” said Nugroho. Then he added that before reaching the shoreline, the body moved to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves with a climbing tree and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque are seen in aerial photos published by the Natural Disaster Agency.
On Saturday, the coastal city visited the second shocks.
There have been a number of earthquakes in the territory of 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the body parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication “has been completely paralysed”, so there is no report from the province of Donggal.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there”, read in a statement by the Red Cross. It was also added that workers and volunteers of the organization go to places affected by disaster.
"We can now talk about tragedy, although the situation may be significantly worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism of the lack of information on the impact of the tsunami in Pal. However, the authorities stated that the waves came just after the warning had been issued.
An amateur video of social media shows a man screaming from a building, trying to warn people on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashed off the coast, taking buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, preventing communication within Pal, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the deployment of transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities began, but evacuations still need food and other basic articles of the first necessity.
Airport located in the city is only open for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
President Joko Vidodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Pal on Sunday.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay, director of the World Vision, safely arrived from the province of Donggal to the city of Palu and found refuge in tents of blight placed in the area of the office. On the way, the workers passed many devastated areas.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While part of the groups were slowly starting to provide assistance, there were voices of criticism that workers of foreign humanitarian organisations with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and personnel abroad can only be initiated after the disaster has been declared a national disaster.
So far, it hasn't been done.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid. However, this has not yet happened."
Two days after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Pal, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who spent two days under rubble beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian Paraletniar team, was trained by two missing paralytists who took part in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other persons imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples.
"As an experienced paratrooper, I am struggling with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subandono told how within hours of the arrival of the community of paralothists of information about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel Desperacco sent messages by communicator WhatsApp to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked only by one gray hook instead of a pair of hooks in blue.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while completing cash at the ATM at Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport Police Command report, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink, a company employee who supplemented cash at the ATM at the Newport shopping center on the Levee.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in an entertainment complex and prepared to supplement the cash," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published communication.
Another man "trapped from behind to Brink's employee" and stole a bag of cash into the ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Command at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes the name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announced his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West”.
Forty-one-year-old musicians have been using Ye's pseudonym for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before visiting the Saturday Night Live program. The artist is expected to present his new album by Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariane Grande, who, according to the creators, gave up on “emotional reasons”.
West had already stated that the word “ye” was not only a shortcut from his present artistic adage, but a religious meaning.
“I think that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means ‘You’,” said West in the previous period of the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
At first I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are."
West is in the midst of other famous rappers who have decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the alias Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-worker of West, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with the connector, without the link and with the capital letters.
Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody demonstration of students, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed never to use the army against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Square of Three Cultures, López Obrador promised to "never use the army to oppress the Mexican nation".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fires on the site towards a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities of young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, says, together with increasing Chinese activity in this area, the United States should double its research expenditure in the field of SI.
The comments made relate to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
On the other hand, last year China presented its plan, according to which it wants to become the most innovative State in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“We should start by doubling the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling funds could increase the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book entitled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies dealing with artificial intelligence in China, known as Face+.
In the 1980s Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create the SI system, which defeated the best then American player in Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was the chairman of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier American government technological initiatives, for example, organised by the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the competition, because he said it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It is not China that takes the best representatives of academic environments from us, but corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that the persons concerned with artificial intelligence who have obtained the doctor's scientific degree should automatically be given a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published an artificial intelligence plan for the next generation.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way similar to the American National Science Foundation and other government organisations that grant funds to American scientists.
In the previous period, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage partners in the world of industry and science.
This month, the DARPA agency also informed about the allocation of $2 billion to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion a year in research into SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to create a national committee on artificial intelligence security has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This movement would allow for several decades of conflict with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where Macedonia's historic country is located, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory.
In June, however, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on naming, and nationalists argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians living in Macedonia.
President ? Jorge Ivanov said he would not vote. The campaign encouraging boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to consider the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following an agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's fall, with organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of my country's future so that young Macedonians can live free under the European Union's umbrella. EU membership will make us all safer," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
While the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
A change of name requires the support of two thirds of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission informed that no unusual events had been reported by 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At that time, 66% of the eligible voters voted.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, the prime minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko gave their vote in a referendum on the change of the country's name to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the House of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents spread out by persons boycotting the referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with our heads up, not the back door," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will speak for changing the name of the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He said that voting "yes" is "a confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote.
Seventy percent of the respondents said they would not change their name.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The collapse in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government policy since the power was taken over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats Brighton's entire defense and wins the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home in Saturday's 2-0 match for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate that Aguera won at 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with the introduction into the centre of the fighting of the Argentine attacker.
The football player outrun three Brighton defenses.
Then Aguero was among the four players in Brighton.
First he played one of them, then ran over the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English attacker immediately handed the ball back to Aguerra in the criminal field, which defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper, shot him on the right side of the gate.
“Aguero struggles with foot injury” said a journalist at Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he won the gate at the time."
However, Sterling ensured a blue first match in the Prime Minister's League.
The gate in question fell within 29 minutes.
In the action of this Aguero, he got a ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful shot to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to distant poles.
Manchester City's attacker directed the ball to the grid just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will meet Hoffenheim at the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will be held at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin his chances of winning the Rockies.
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to be in the first formation.
However, Scherzer hopes to perform in a Sunday match against Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies retain their chances of performing in the playoff phase. Currently, the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's game against Nationals score of 5:2. However, they still want their first title as a division champion.
"Although we play 'nothing', at least we will go to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the appearance of opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in this meeting?"
Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting. However, the team tends to exhibit Scher in the first formation.
It would have been Scher's thirty-fourth performance in the first part. The show took part in Thursday's shooting training and hopes to take place on Sunday.
The right-hand gunman of the Washington team scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the matches and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the Republicans' turnout in half the election.
"In November, we put all the achievements that have been achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our excellent candidates," he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power with all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out a mission of "resisting and obstructing activities".
"It was very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling on the American senator from the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, for a loud noise from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
"Oh, I'm listening?
Her body language was fatal, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their own opinions
When my party's momentum operatives voted in favour of giving me an urge, I wasn't surprised.
At the end of the day, I am a member of the Labour Party Group, who was told recently that they are not welcome, and all because of their own views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for an impulse was based on the difference of the line between me and Jeremy Corby.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In Friday's announcement of a meeting of the Labour Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have served as a member of the Labour Party for most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now going differently. Long forgotten the promise of a “mercy and milder” policy, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the management of the party.
It all began shortly after Jeremy Corby's presidency. Colleagues, where I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change directions and take positions that I would not have agreed with before. They were concerned with issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After any public appearance, irrespective of the content, I meet in social media with attacks calling for nomination, condemnation of centrism or abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments at my address are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily treatment in a sexist or racist way, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with insults to others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every proposal for a "vot of mistrust" and any change in the rules of choice, the party’s view is narrowed.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I do not veer away and ignore certain issues.
However, that is not why I took on politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which led to the collapse of my school class, I am trying to improve the quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councilman and minister.
I've never covered up my beliefs, even in the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East County knew my position and knew of the differences of language with the party authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the president of the labour force in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is addressed not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats to withdraw nominations or urgent political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vr Melrose 38:17 – Unbeatable Ayr again with mountain
Two late applications could at some point distort the final score, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scottish extralities match.
The team was first placed in the table and remains the only unbeatable team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of opportunities led the team of hosts to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his guardians.
"So far, matches have been a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose’s team, said: “We should pay our respects to the players of Ayr. They took better advantage of us than we do. ”
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after putting on Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Clem. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes' Scots, who came to the team of Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to balance the score when Jason Baggott caught the ball at an untapped opportunity to raise.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after he kicked out of a prison sentence just before the end of the first half. First he gained the touch, and then took advantage of the opportunity to raise, with a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose well started the second half. Patrick Anderson's attitude raised by Baggotto reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer suspension of the game due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott. The leader was removed from the field on the stretcher. After the resumption of Ayr increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowal and the rise of the climate.
Further in line, the captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson team received the yellow card. Melrose again took advantage of his number: the application of the unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting the climate without a ball. MacPherson gained an attachment on the back of the approaching defense.
Then, once again, he was able to raise the score right after the game was reinstated, when Kyle Rowe took the shot from the punishment shot and allowed the wingman Gregor Henry to get the fifth fit for the host.
Still Game Star Begins a Career in the Gastronomy Industry
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems to be starting a business in the gastronomic industry. It was recently discovered that he was the director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is playing the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC network. He plays and co-creates the series together with his multi-year comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season will be the last in the history of the show. It all points to the fact that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future of leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the informer Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the “developing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the lack of access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines patrol the vicinity of the La Paz Navy base.
Blue flags come from public buildings.
At the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the following motto is illustrated: “The sea is ours under the law.
His return is our duty."
With no access to the sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict of resources remains alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest for several decades. Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice to be delivered on 1 October following a five-year trial.
"The activities of Bolivia are taking on momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and rely on a favourable verdict," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch a joint meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the Hague-based organisation will recognise Bolivia's claim and that after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to negotiate the granting of independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who will stand next year in the controversy about the struggle for reelection, also hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favourable ruling for Bolivia are low and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also objected that it would not affect the determination of possible talks.
As Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist on international law, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments are presented.
Unfortunately, Bolivia's last four years have been able to distance the country from its target.
"The issue of access to the sea has been highlighted by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The persistent rhetoric of Morales deprived the Chileans of any remnant of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will start conversations at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
For both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility "to end the 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the subject of access to the sea as part of political play.
"Polivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an excellent opportunity to believe that we have to deal with the past."
The North Koreans claim that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his people will never be rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be at the edge of the resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the “frozen” is as if the absence of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the declaration of the end of the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not agree to the signing of the declaration without prior action by Pjongjang on specific disarmament steps.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pjongjang is seriously approaching the liquidation of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means to guarantee security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month as part of preparations for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
Paris’ fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest line of great head coverings in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover yourself in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the course a series of crazy, oversized, head coverings that were part of their summer 2019 collection, which brightened in style during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
The Instagrams were very impractical hats that summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered round of models.
Other excessive accessories included abrasions decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple — but were not designed to warm his head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of peculiar masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had a sewn mouth and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with pipe and glasses, and another looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break fashion, you're lucky.
Style viewers predict that huge hats can be found in clothing stores.
The immeasurable hats follow “La Bomba, ” a broken hat with a 60 - foot [61 cm] - wide ronde that everyone has worn — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which has been spilled by social media, has shown another great creation in the race — a broken beach bag almost as large as the model wearing it dressed as a bathing suit.
The tanned orange Rafi bag, finished with ruffles and a white leather hand, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer 2019 season during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, said FEMAIL: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in stores next year — because the designer has managed to produce such a large impact, it would be difficult not to use the demand for excessive accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills needed for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018, they were able to boast of further outstanding results from exams, supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
Representatives of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools attended by over 30,000 students throughout Scotland seek to ensure the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Schools are independent to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and their role as citizens of the world.
As an education sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a school-friendly learning programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for school choices.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you talk to another person in a language that he understands, then it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages take first place in league rankings, with highest exposure rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received higher A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS members showed that 72 percent of students received higher A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language learning, as a subject of choice, is currently carried out in the same scope as the teaching of STEM (studies of science, technology, engineering and mathematics) under independent and other teaching programmes.
A 2014 study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that 17 percent of employers' job vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world in an increasing number of jobs requiring language knowledge,
Lifelong learning, such as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future — regardless of the career path chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person compared to competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov survey, which brought together more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language in which the percentage of people in use was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign languages is so important for children today.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ in terms of its language.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages considered important for the UK in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interest, independent schools will always have many languages to choose from, which will be taught by the teaching staff in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are involved in creating an environment of teaching that will prepare children and equip them to succeed — no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a large choice, diversity and level.
That's just the way it is.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut on the Lakers team Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers are finally waiting.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James will play Sunday's pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one but less than 48”, said Walton on the team’s official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play part of the minutes.
After the training that took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers pre-season matches.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need to participate in pre-seasonal games to prepare myself," he said.
So the West Virginia Election Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, with a series of electoral councils.
This is the first of the five electoral councils planned by Trump that will take place next week, along with positions in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with the vote confirming the holding of his election to establish a free position in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming elections at the midpoint of the government, as the Republicans may be threatened to lose control of the Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will be tonight, so the Western Virginia Election Trump, and where will it be possible to watch it on the Internet?
So the Election Trump in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held today at 19:00, i.e. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So the West Virginia Election Trump will be able to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings by a nominee nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated vote in the Senate to suspend the election for a period of up to one week, during the conduct of the FBI's investigation.
However, the main objective of this electoral series is to support the Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign with five evenings next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's timetable that as the worst year of the campaign approaches, it will visit as many states as possible," said Trump campaign advocate, who did not consent to his name being given — Reuters.
Today’s election in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia's candidate to the Senate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who loses his polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows the spirit of fighting, maintaining hope of winning Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating speed of the jet is a completely fabricated sports concept, but one in which players really believe, and most of all at competitions like these.
So what's their rush at this point?
"They ran six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we've got a little momentum," said Jordan Spith.
Europe, of course, leads four points, while there are twelve more points to win.
Americans, as Spith says, however, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy role models, especially in the form of Spitha and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of winning three points of four.
Spith is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Screaming all over his throat as a sign of excitement became louder during the course of his round, drowning a key path and winning a match when he and Thomas won two holes in two strikes.
His reflection on the earth, which gave them victory with result 15, met with a similar shout — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"It is enough to focus and worry about your own game," said Spith.
That's all that's left for each of those players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who scored more points in the last two days than Spith and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming pair of European teams won four out of four and was not wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way in and how their energy seems to flow both to and from a noisy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they played the same game at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning Fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
Bodey and double-double on the front nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between couples, the advice they provide, the advice they do not give, and how a change of strategy can take place at one point.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken on a significant advantage of the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has been fighting in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes running on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday Fourball and Foursome matches with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — led the grey with two victories over Tiger Woods, increasing its current score to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an incomplete American team in the early form of furball, winning a series with a score of 3-1.
The United States has put up more resistance in the form of fursome, winning two matches, but could not do away with the losses.
To preserve the trophy, Jim Furyk's team needs to score eight points from the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (the team was named "Milliwood" after a sensational weekend) is just the second pair in the Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening games.
After the crush of Woods and Patrick Reed in the form of furball in a great style, they beat the pumped Woods and American debutante Bryson Dehambeau, even more empathetic at 5.4.
Woods, who overslept through two Saturday games, had occasionally exhibited genius flashes, but had lost 19 of the 29 games in fours and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had no part in the early forms of furball, returned to Henrik Stanson in foursome format to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in World rankings 1 and 3 respectively.
However, not everything went according to the European team in this pleasant, chilly day in the field to the southwest of Paris.
The three main winners, Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, set up a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a score of 2–1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the form of furball and then returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4–3 in the form of fursome, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has the team made a four-point loss by starting singles, although the Furyk team would only have enough to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea speaks of “studentally no” unilateral disarmament without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during a UN speech that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of North Korea's confidence in the United States and there is no way that country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken last year's "meaning means of goodwill", such as nuclear and missile testing halting, dismantling nuclear testing sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s unwillingness to take a “stage” approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader, who took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the "denocularization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (from 1950 to 1953), but the United States delegation announced that Pjongjang must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also relied on calls to mitigate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation in the first place" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even opposing the signing of the "war end declaration", Ri said.
“The testimony that sanctions can throw us on our knees is a smog of people who act ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which was discussed at the beginning of the week by the United States leader at the UN forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, after which he added: “If South Korea was a party to denuclearisation and not the United States, then there was no such implosion in the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different compared to the year before when he said it during the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea’s rockets in the territory of the United States is inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump (Mr.
This year, at the UN Trump forum, which threatened "the total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said that there was a great deal of work to be done, and said that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time limit, saying: “It doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council forum: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be continued and continued until full, final and verified denuclearisation is established".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea by trying to fund the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pjongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pjongjang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for “forming gangster desires” within hours.
North Korea committed to meeting with Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle the place of missile testing and nuclear complex if the United States takes “the appropriate measures”.
He stated that Kim Jong Un had told him that “the appropriate measures” on which he cared were the security guarantees for which Trump had committed himself in Singapore, and that he would take steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course for adequate long rest
The new course at Harvard University, which was held this year, provided all students with more sleep, which was designed to combat the growing macho culture, which was based on learning by "nightly students driven by caffeine".
Students of academics from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such in the United States.
He was inspired to make a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
"When the speech was over, a girl approached me and said, "Why am I told this just now that I'm in my last year of college?"
She found that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, students are told how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the general self-esteem of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health service, said that this course was decided to take place after it was found that students suffered from serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in the dorm where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, and how important it is to keep sleep regular.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancers.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behaviour.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects the smoking of cigarettes entails," added Professor Cheisler
The culture of pride from "everyday science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means an ever-increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to become hungry, which makes the student constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to put pressure on the whole campus course.
The next step, he said, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful influence of the “blue light” emitted by the displays of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can disrupt the day’s rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gets Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the struggle to leave Livingstone, when Dolly Menga fired his shot at the defeat of the disbanded Steven Gerrard team, achieving a score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record its first victory from the February 4-1 triumph over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches, causing him to distinguish eight points from the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the composition of the Rangers showing a lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a fall to sixth place, Livingstone climbed third — just behind the Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to repair the head injury of Judge Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown out of the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, allowing him to outrun Ayr and move on to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, passed with the same eleven of Livingstone, who took over the Hearts team last week, being an amazing way in which his well-trained team was tormented at every turn of their opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes when this first pitch of the ball by Menga allowed Scott Pittman to face the Allan McGregor gate, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs took a deep shot free to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who was playing defense, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he needed a penalty of fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless stumbled upon each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dissolved the Colombian claim.
The Rangers were only able to give back two of the first-half customs shots, but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibala's head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While won by Livingston in 34 minutes the opening goal could be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into winning it.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle the deep constant piece of the game performed by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his cool, putting it in Mengi for a simple finish.
Gerrard did not miss a break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — the change almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
Livingstone continued to bring guests into the game exactly as they like when Lithgow and Halkett made long meals one after the other.
Holt's team could have stepped up the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor took a good look at Jacobs, and Lithgow removed the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, was once again hoping to throw a penalty when he confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: Geiger Counter Inventor
And now a page from our issue “Sunday Morning” Almanac: 30 September 1882 — 136 years ago... the day when physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and popculture, such as the 1950 Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have appeared:
Man: "What evil is this?"
Rogers: “It is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemies of the cells as part of the treatment.
This method consists of separating immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein common to many cancers. Then they are injected into the body again.
The trial vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
In one woman treated with the immunodeficiency system, an ovarian cancer has been observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very good.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast cancer, ovary, lung and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of immune cells from patients and to the learning of their location of cancer cells has worked to treat some type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-trump diatribe in the Saturday Night Live program — with a MAGA hat on its head.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was "exploded" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing that night his third song, entitled Ghost Town, during which he had a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he conducted an argument against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Although I speak to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony filed before the shadow court about the sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's video was sent to social media by Chris Rock's comic.
We don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble with his hat behind the scenes.
"They're after me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no choice," he said, " Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Are you saying I have no choice?", adding, "I will put on a "superman's sweater, so you won't be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept."
His words caused the audience’s “wake ” twice, and the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, reports Varieta.
West was invited to the program instead of Ariana Grande, who was a boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many by making I Love it in dressing bottles of water Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative group head, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR MAFIA.
Leading talk show Karen Hunter on her Twitter show said that West just "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful".
“But I WILL NOT reward the person (by buying her music or clothes or by supporting her “art”), who I think accepts and spreads a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
So we are free," she added.
Before the program rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "formally named Kanye West".
But he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then an artist known earlier as Prince.

A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

Kit Harrington's throne star addresses toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO "Gra o tron" series.
A 31-year-old actor struck on the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough guys to be respected.
When interviewing the Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that “something had gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the game plan for the throne, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "very confident" in addressing the issue.
"I personally feel quite at this point — where did we make a mistake in the subject of masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the problem we are now facing?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity can be partly responsible for television performance of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born and what attitudes are taught?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
Clearly, there is nothing wrong with young men."
He also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones after the end of the series next year, saying that he “has finished with the fields of battle and horse. ”
Since November Kit will be playing the play “True West” by Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
Actor recently said that he considers getting to know his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On the plan I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this award - winning Emma’s fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the character played by Kita, Jon Snow.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the problem, as health workers in this country report.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of the new cases were transmitted by gender, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV was almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 a year.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is widespread.
Considering the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to insufficient collateral during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies it as if one of her team members had disclosed the data of the Republican senators — "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
A member of the House of Representatives of the United States, Maxine Waters, dismissed the charges on Saturday as though a member of her team had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's side of the so-called legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Party of Democrats has ensured that these accusations were brought by experts and websites linked to "ultracorrective wings".
"Lyings, lies and even worse lies," Waters tweeted on Twitter.
The public information was similar to the home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during the hearing of the panel in the Senate on allegations of sexual offences against the nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh's candidate.
A conservative site, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about the Waters team member, as Hill reports.
"This baseless charge is totally false and it is a st-percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and it's a st-percent lie."
Waters quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
"This way of denying is bad," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He may not question the motives of the defendant.
He has to stay calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrat criticism at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive anger during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Stupid matter, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet had informed "the proper authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent accusations".
"The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to justice for all their actions which are a threat to any of the members of my team," she said.
Johnny English Review: Knockout — Spy Parade with Rivan Atkinson weakened
Looking for references to Brexit in any new film with British thread has already become the norm. It seems to apply to a new part of a series of films of action and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the movies in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will a self-refusing satire about how hopeless we are become the country's new export commodity?
In any case, the eternally surprised, rubber-shaped, incompetent Johnny English again received a printing license — his name and name more than anything else signal that he is an expanded, comical device designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite his strange apprehensions to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasius Fasola and a drop from this guy who adds a single note to the melody of Chariots of Fire's leading theme at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-class man of mystery — Atkinson once played in the forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, where he left chaos.
The latest Johnny English film is one or two moments worth paying attention to.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was struck rhythmically by the spindle blades.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is clearly visible on the screen, but the sense of humor seems to be rather low and unnecessary, especially since now also "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be directed towards children instead of adults — I think Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gags in the silent Atkinson movies about Jasi Fasola.
It has always been the current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker enters the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the horror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It is the last drop in a bitter prime minister's spell, which is a pompous, wasted figure already and so suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, becoming Theresa May, but the script does not allow her to develop her wings.
Her intelligence advisors are informing her that, in order to disclose the identity of all active spies, she will have to reinstate one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English's poor self-employed, currently employed as a teacher at some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — some pretty good gigs while providing English spy lessons.
English is called to the Whitehall to be interviewed, again connecting with its former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin partying in the secret service of Her Royal Highness return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously overwhelmed by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems — he is the catch of Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their absurd cruise: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they introduce chaos by sneaking onto the luxury yacht Volta; and English sows desolation when using a set of virtual reality to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all the restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and loud performance, the entire film is very much like television for children.
Typical middleman.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't resist thinking: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is to draw up a plan that provides for the British for a four-year work week for which they will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, with a salary of five days.
The party reportedly wants the company heads to hand over the savings generated by the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
As a result, workers could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that this idea will "enter" into the economic agenda of the party and plans to leave the country against the workers.
The transition to a four-year work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way to benefit from workers in changing the economy.
Senior Labour Party member in a conversation with The Sunday Times said, "It is expected that before the end of this year there will be an announcement of policy change."
"It will not happen from day to day, but a four-year working week is something that is included in the party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed itself to entering a four - week week job during the election campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The weekly work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it."
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he is determined to regain power from "directors without face" and "species" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow office also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share because the Labour Party's government could make a "debate" on the basis of detected abuse.
He also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in company management and the creation of integrated equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are answering the 60-minute program's question of whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question whether the findings of the investigation office could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's interview by Scott Pelley's 60-minute program asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that might change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina buddy.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the charge came, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined and unequivocal."
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong charge," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
"Neither of the people she's giving could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's going to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival event, and has it contributed to any reduction in poverty?
On the next Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York City, an annual musical event that can honor the impressive composition of the stars and the equally impressive mission of eradicating poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizens Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, making a phone call or other significant actions to help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating poverty.
But what success can Global Citizens boast in view of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing a petition or posting an entry on Tweeter?
Global Citizens claims that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of action supporters, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to declare commitments and regulations worth more than 37 billion dollars, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, in which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured measures have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the UK partnership of investors and developers involved in "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after Global Citizens sent over 4,700 tweets.
“Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, such as you, we can make the social injustice that is undernourishment turn into history” — Tracey Ulman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Great Britain to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, which was “How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated? ”
Global citizenship responded: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will face failures and failures.
But as with the recent great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars present during this year's event in New York, which will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports — Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" flee to its military navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing to the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it works to invite the right-wing government — was a pretext for exploiting new energy markets.
"I note that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States, in the case of its warship, is able to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants of the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "voice of the consumer of energy" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia consists in the use and replacement of fuel," he said, comparing Russia to a "one-art dog" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when Trump's administration is continuing a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including United States President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, are a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the heated opposition of Washington to the project is based solely on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States led to a strong reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said Saturday that after the mid-term elections, they would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair a corrupt government. This is also true of a woman in the highest position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for the presidency."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trumpe, saying that "it leads the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren voiced her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters from Massachusetts choosing the option “probably” said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent supported his potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed him.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account with regard to the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said she'd make an official decision by January, as Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin speaks of a group of post-traumatic stress (PTSD) Track Palin during the election council of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which must go through after his return, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience in the election council of Donald Trump in the town of Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "the topic of the taboo", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "the slightly different are coming back, the hardened ones are coming back, wondering whether there will be any respect for what their fellow soldiers, the airmen and all other members of the army have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence on a woman, inciting false testimony in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon inadvertently, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Department of the Police of Wasilli.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new United States policy, which refuses asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and district submitted a list of amicus curics in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers struggling with this policy, as reported by the NBC News.
The full name of the cause in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union put against federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner “and his brutal sons from the gang” had been harassing her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of the state of support described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States as countries facing widespread gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy removed Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Prosecutor General of the District of Colombia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has been ignoring state, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances and that such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of amicus curic.
Prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy to refuse immigrants to enter harms the economies of the United States, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Assistance is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or ethnic origin, or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political convictions” said Sessions in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
The goal of asylum was never to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal in a situation where the death tolls doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
"It is a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, consoling her embroiled son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
‘Each minute, the body imports.
There's no clean water."
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching over over water things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overcrowded.
Some wounded, including Two Harris, who suffered fractures of the spine and shoulders, were resting outside the military hospital in Palo, where patients were treated outside because of severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was pushed into the wall’s yard” — Harris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and her voice was shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "rape" propaganda advertisements.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the American daily praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily’s paid allowance in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to join the elections to the United States Congress on 6 November — the Chinese deny the charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to join the US elections confirmed what US officials told Reuters that it was a new stage in escalating the Washington campaign to create pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertisements with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently leading to an escalation of the trade war, which has led to the lifting of tariffs for mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were to be touched by exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa’s many - year - old state, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “now with double force begins harassment, placing propaganda in our own free press.”
“By promoting its propaganda, the Chinese government enjoys a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register”, Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no voices of opposition in the street in Beijing, and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic direction, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans are threatening each other with the midterm election of women with voting rights by having an affair with Kavanaugh, warned analysts
While many leading Republicans support and the weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially by women.
The emotions surrounding this event are extremely high, and most republicans already want to vote officially.
“It can’t be reversed, ” said a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s efforts to carry out the last minute of the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it until November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the MoveOn Group, reported a newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted the slogan "The Coming November", demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of a determination by the Republicans in control of the Kavanaugh’s nomination for Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, as Mic put it.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale", said one news site Stu Rotenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already so high – and it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among the undecided women of suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, it could have been a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," Michael Steele said early last week, former President of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News reports.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, but also the way the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have handled Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the US priorities, said on one of the news channels, a group that helps the election of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support for this last one.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of the respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh's testimony, definitely or rather.
In addition, 38% of respondents found that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during the depositions, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's press release, the FBI began an investigation into the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her at 17 years of age under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez claims that the nominee of the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web network is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Team Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform, Solid, owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to create “domination over the world”.
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to enable people to create their own “Internet cellar with personal data” or otherwise the POD.
It can include contact lists, list of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed in the project and a volunteer community.
Since this week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which will cause upside down all their business models from day to day.
"I'm not asking them for permission."
On Saturday's Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to supply commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network based on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been much involved in the debate on net neutrality.
The Inrupt Berners-Lee will become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I as a combatants was celebrated by the Cross of Victoria, was celebrated 100 years later in his home town.
The regiment of Reverend Bernard Vann was celebrated on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed four days later by a sniper, never finding out he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday his two grandkids opened a memorial stone during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, said that the opening of the stone was precisely on the sixth anniversary of his grandfather’s observance, “extremely symbolic. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under strong fire from the field and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led her forward, after which he launched an attack on the position of the field, destroying three of them.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I could never cope with, but something humble at the same time”.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to participate in the parade” and added that“ the courage of a true hero manifests itself in the support he receives from many people. ”
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, they got Pig Peppa instead.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the embodiment of the Bellator 206 gala and finally can't see the main struggle.
The San Jose gala program contained 13 fights, including six on the main map, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the fight, viewers in Britain were shocked by the change in the program for Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed not to sleep until the early morning hours, especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in cartoons for children as "a sick joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication of Bellator organizations when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Pig, yeah."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're going to work out a timetable to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about repeating the situation, I think we can fix it," said Coker.
"But Sunday is 6 a.m., so we won't be able to deal with it until Sunday in our time, and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of agenda, we were filled with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We were trying to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to satisfy the fans too much and unfortunately we overcame it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic Water Jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs 4 radio by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual guide of this program, Kirsty Young, for many years, took several months off due to illness.
As he appeared in the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up was “less valuable” than others, because “co-likeness of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “To date, it is a sense of inferiority and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “worthed, ” not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a vocal actor of the LGBT community and used his performance at this year's Community Games in Australia to appeal to more countries for the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said that he had decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and thus wanted to give others “hope. ”
Three times the world’s champion said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustina Lance Black, who he met in 2013 “surprised him. ”
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older from him) last year, noting that this age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at a young age”, he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death because of cancer three years later, “he said that it was difficult for him to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple stayed in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that his perception of certain things had changed completely.
"Last year, it was important for me to win a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after he diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't be with us to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died did I realize that he was not invincible," he said.
In the following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water before the crowds at the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first song — the stream performed by Heather Small — which accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and which continues to spice him up with goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Displaying the lack of Mickelson shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so that she doesn't press her heel.
Mickelson, who plays the twelfth in every two years of the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourball and Foursome games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has often happened in his case in the United States team, five times the main winner had to spend a day at the team's doping and working to improve his game in hopes of correcting the reason for his referral to the bench.
48-year-olds who have never given away the simplest hits, even at the peak of their careers, are not very good on Le Golf National's narrow field, where mischievous punches are ruthlessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not disheartening enough for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth game, he must face the precision of the British Open winner — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutante Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with a thread, the game of Mickelson can be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player — he could hardly have done anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident of himself.
He is in the gallery of fame and has brought much to play with his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on the Ryder Cup game Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which has never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 failures and seven drawbacks in his account, and Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
"It is funny, sarcastic, funny, funny and it is good to have it in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings a lot more to his person than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great point advantage can soon collapse.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in the Valderram field, where, together with Deputy Deputy Vice-Captain Seven Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed by with the shortest of possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It can be forgotten that we had a great advantage in the Valderram field; we also had a great advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the Valderram field we only won by hair," Bjorn said, in the picture, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave us a lead of 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will only be when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal that is to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
From the beginning, I said that I am focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are — the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his contestants handled themselves in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it better.
But tomorrow it's different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything goes your way, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limits of opportunity.
That's the message that you have to give to the players, it's to give everything you have tomorrow.
The partner also has to do his best."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better on their own than when playing with their partner, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk himself experienced major returns on his last day as a member of the winning team in the Brooklyn field, after which he failed after the European team accomplished “a miracle in the Medinah field”.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“In the morning we are playing 12 important games – you would like to start a game at a fast pace as it happened on the fields of Brooklyn and Medinah.
If this momentum goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle swords.
We've set up our composition accordingly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to conduct a counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the leading half of the program.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he can handle all the games," Bjorn said about his single choices.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put to use in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War, but it will not take place until at least next year due to defective arrangements and rising costs, as the local media reported.
The reference to the use of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the main vessel of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the military navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems encountered after delivery, changes to this ambitious project were needed.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar tracks, infrared and acoustic.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — the operation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years from home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to react to situations abroad, will become obsolete at the time of the start of service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the front pages of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the ship's Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key “software and equipment flaws” that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Specially important were software failures as Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is less than half the size of the Bremen class of older frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future modernisation by the Navy.
It is believed that the 7000 tonnes of ship Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the entire project — including crew training.
It is said to have reached a stunning amount of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was worth EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German fleet’s strength is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy "will end ships capable of using".
He also said that the problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Secret Life of Bats
The new research carried out in the Scottish Highlands area is intended to show how bats use the landscape during food production.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future actions towards their protection.
Research carried out by researchers from National Trust for Scotland will concern dwarfs common and small, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the family of red nights in the Inverew Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special registrars will be placed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is designed to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how species behave.
Then a habitat map and a report will be developed to create a detailed image of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser in the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are essential for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to habitat management, e.g. meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work, which affects gardens and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can be seen from flies and certain chemicals used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of the nightly customs of their hunting ears are more helpful than the eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for bugs and obstacles in their path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct tests, check the grids, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland in the area of the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, head of the estate, says she's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of inspections for bats prior to accession to maintenance work in the premises, as the unintentional destruction of one garden can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing, or disrupting them, and destroying their walls is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers intend to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made allegations against him of rape as "fake news", saying that people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was charged with the rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's news, Der Spiegel's football player was supposed to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the indictments were announced, in an on-line live broadcast addressed to his 142 million followers, he described these reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said a five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I am happy and everything is fine," added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to call Der Spiegel on charges that they called "an unacceptable statement of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek compensation for “the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The river entrance was scheduled to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally — according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo reportedly fell to his knees and told her that “99 percent is a good man ” who was visited by this “one percent. ”
According to Ronaldo's records, he confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done at the same time.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now, because she still can't forget her alleged case.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that year he moved to Juventus after paying him 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain would "sorry all the time" the departure of car manufacturers
Great Britain "would regret this all the time" if, after leaving the European Union, it had lost its status as a world leader in car production, said Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that he was "disturbed" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, production at the Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need agreements," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The factory in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade can work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers claim, the risks posed by the supply chain in the case of the leaving of the European Union by the United Kingdom without agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates under the “just-in-time” principle, in which part reaches every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-produced cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be difficulties at the border, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without supplies to his factory in Derbyshire, so the production would have been stopped.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We need agreements. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy our current success, but also allow us to make proper use of this situation," BBC Radio 4 said in today's programme.
"The statements not only by Toyota but also by other producers show that we must be able to continue what consisted of a very efficient supply chain set."
Toyota’s representation could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at a plant in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the board of the union organization Unite, said that members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, as the White House says.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "spent for another week" due to a constant fight for a candidate for the highest Brett Kavanaugh court, as the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trumpa and Russia's close co-workers and the potential for obstructing justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times newspaper reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were going to go to the dissension.
The meeting with Trump, then held at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, and there was a delay in the meeting to avoid any conflict with the Senate court hearing during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trumpa Press Dictionary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it can take place this week, and it can be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll tell the press for sure."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The program manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by the reluctance of "sustentive" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "sustentive".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President is holding more "questions and answers" than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence, "We are familiar with numbers".
Press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to direct questions to the President of the United States, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done this very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Salt press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the collected journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to European Union workers employed in Scottish health care in order to convey to them expressions of gratitude from the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of examining applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote: “This summer the negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union continued, and appropriate decisions will be made this autumn.
The British Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, irrespective of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and outside it offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes head trauma surgery
Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a head trauma operation in Saturday's match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended with a team failure from Tennessee with a score of 31-27, reported Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered a trauma shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the side line, and then he went to the ground," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie the oxygen on the side line, then placed it on the stretchers and carried it out for further testing.
Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/size of injury yet” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (second year student released from university representation for a year to train his skills) is playing his first season in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the match ended, he had five grays, which gives him 18 grays throughout the season.
Foreign purchasers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
In accordance with the new plans of the Tory Buyers from abroad, higher fees will be charged for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The increase in fees will include those who do not tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Treasury foresees that in this way it will receive as much as 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May informs us today that foreign purchasers of property in the United Kingdom will be charged a higher tax, and the additional funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is being taken as an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young electorate to the promises of cheaper apartments and to increase the burden of more earners.
The higher fees will be payable to individuals and non-tax companies in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee — charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates imposed two years ago for other houses and rental apartments — may be up to three percent.
The state Treasury expects this move to generate as much as 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hampering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time abroad, many rich regions — especially the capital city — have become “a city of spirits. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson was called on to reduce the cost to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap flats to eliminate the "inhabitation scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the exposition "for no reason".
He also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I am engaged in rebuilding the British dream of making the life of every next generation better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our busy housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy property here that is hard working British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become very distant, for the humiliation associated with the need to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a selectionor of Scotland"
Sunderland's coach, Jack Ross, says that his "most ambition" is to become Scotland's selector at some point.
This 40-year-old Scot is committed to the recovery of the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after introducing the St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only managed to get B's footage," Ross said in an interview for the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched a Scottish match with my father in Hampton, and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a coach of the club."
Among Ross' predecessors were coach Sunderland, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he does not feel discouraged, taking on a role in such prominent personalities in such a large club, rejecting previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At present, success will be measured for me whether I can bring this club back to Prime Minister League.
Taking into account its structure and the convenience it has, there is no doubt its place there," he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed."
Ross's coaching career lasted only three years. Before that, he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coach team.
He then helped Alloa re-progress after the third league was demoted, and in the next season he led the St Mirren team from the brink of falling to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real turning point," says Coach Allo.
“I really believed that running a team was much better for me than playing.
It's gonna sound weird, because as a player, I did well, and I made a few tangible successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to break through situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the coach's work, but I feel good about it.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it.

Research shows that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a violent influx of customers into the British pubs, but it bounced off the restaurant network.
Studies showed that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company, who developed the data, says: “Silent heat and longer than anticipated England’s participation in the World Cups caused the results of July to be similar to June, when the pubs’ turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings dropped even more.
The increase in sales in restaurants in July, recorded in June 1,8 %, increased even more.
Pub and bar drinks were well managed — their increase in sales exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
The pubs serving the food also suffered during the heat, although not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, of RSM’s entertainment and tourism industry analysis, says: “These results have been recorded in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of outside consumption remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that the network of restaurants is experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the fall in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will have particularly dramatic consequences, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer came at the least convenient moment for the owners of food-serving sites and time to show whether the somewhat moderate temperatures we had in August would bring such needed breathing."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including these newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One per five children has secret accounts in social media that hides from parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some of them only 11 years of age — has secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers
A survey carried out among 20,000 pupils in higher secondary schools showed an increase in the number of pages of "fake insta"
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is published on them.
Twenty percent of the students found that they had a "primary" account that showed them to their parents.
One per five children — some only 11 years of age — has established accounts on social networks that he does not disclose to adults.
A survey carried out among 20,000 pupils in pre-basic schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Instagram" accounts, the name refers to Instagram, where photos can be shared.
These reports have fueled fears that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they run a polite “main ” account that shows them to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who happened to come across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter ran into a teenager who was urging others to "rape them".
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11-18 years run two profiles. Half of them are eligible for private accounts.
HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is worrying that so many teenagers create their places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most popular Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as a perfect opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world lightweight communities, and we are confident that introducing her to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to be able to give the board the votes of athletes, and I hope that I can really help in managing sports in Scotland.”
An American who wins 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Olympics in his four gold Olympic medals, and now regularly takes part in the BBC as an expert, cannot be a result of a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show whether I would regain efficiency and to what extent.
It was pathetic work, but I was fully healed, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!"
Lactator advertising, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactator company caused a storm on the Internet by publishing an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milk cows.
In order to announce the launch of "the world's first silent lactator to wear clothes", his producer, Elvie, published a mocking advertisement in the form of a video that highlights the freedom he gives to mothers.
She introduces four real mothers dancing in a haystack in a song where she hears the words, "Yes, I understand, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't see, it doesn't just replace my tits."
The chorus goes: “Pick them up, pump them up, feed them to the children, pump them up, pump them up, I understand my masters. ”
The advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused major controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claiming that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horroru” that occurs in the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their children being taken from them after a few days of birth," one user wrote.
Elvie’s lactator may be undetected under breast feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both mother and child.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their children."
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Another clip gun, one of the women, said that she thought the song was “fun. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was taking my food away.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I'm not looking into it the second day.
This is a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun commercial directed to mothers who draw away food (often at work or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the movie, women danced with lactators attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie Lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and you can wear it undetected under bra to feed, which gives women freedom to move, hold children on your hands, and even walk out of the house while drawing food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative premiere.
When we put together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting in a funny and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children with the product attached appeared at the show Marty Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to the tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is rising rapidly, although the number of persons crossing the border does not exactly change every month. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who fear the risk of deportation if they apply for a child.
Such risks were increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in the common farm would receive fingerprints which would then be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had volunteered as sponsors for children left unattended.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests were not previously reported.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or residing with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal background.
That is why we are constantly pursuing them," said Albence.
The employees of the shelter say that, as part of efforts to accelerate the regulation of the situation, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest — not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
Much will be put up through videoconference, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempted escape.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious for larger centres such as Tornillo, where because of its size it is easier to overlook signals that something bad is happening with the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his statement before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in Syria has lasted for eight years.
Moal, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally” said the assembly.
Moab claims that “the war on terrorism has almost ended” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
She says that Damascus will continue to "lead its holy battle until Syria's territory is cleansed" both from terrorist groups and from "all foreigners illegally present in it".
Today, in Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers who are mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in a war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moab found that conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of“ raising up irrational fear, ” which discourages them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help with these returns," he said.
"They politicalise matters which should have a purely human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad enters into a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "express time frame", and expressed the hope that the military action would be carried out in the jihadists, including fighters associated with the Al-Qaeda Defence Front of the Levant People, who would be "exposed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the governing and opposition party to draw up a draft post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "checking the records of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency ends with an early removal from office and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of the presidency so far".
So far, there's no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership has doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s channel has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen Fox News, 2.4 million viewers are on average in the hours of the largest ratings, up from 1.7 million over four years ago, and the MSNBC programme "The Rachel Maddow Show" has achieved the highest performance among cable televisions, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening news programmes.
"People fly like moths to fire – that is something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, lead producer of ABC "Designed Survival" about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy maker and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She mentions driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has an entertainment value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, as nothing else on television, rule on the future of Roe v. Wade, the permissibility of the integration of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts discussing using Bob Woodward's secret informants when writing a book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's skin rubs for 15,000 dollars (“dresses of pride”, as described by The Washington Post) or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
“What he does partly resembles the reality of the show in terms of what the evening provides new content,” said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the changing siege and daily returns of the show Trump (as an attack on NFL league players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss an episode, 'cause you're gonna be behind.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where he owns his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Judicial Commission and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The flow of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
Not surprisingly, after the re-organization of electoral districts, which will result in two congressmen currently serving in the race, there will be a cash flow to the 17th election district in Pennsylvania.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburgh represents a Democratic representative in Congress, Conor Lamb, who gained his place in another district during the special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing former 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new district 17.
The county maps were corrected following the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were wrongly appointed, which gave the Republicans an advantage and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a campaign to finance the campaign between the main party funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning a wide-ranging election to the 18th constituency in March.
In that position, he had been a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in that district.
Policy experts have given Democrats little advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn from this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominicans and Panama had already recognised Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the team managing the Trump Organization was expelled from Panama, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to call off the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop the recognition of Taiwan", according to spokesman Heather Nauert in her statement this month.
However, the sanctions to be considered were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which was estimated to receive 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017 to combat drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very sensitive to this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and high murder rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to address proposals from a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus doing all they could to consider sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that now, at a conference that is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence is scheduled to take place, which should be a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the meeting.
Three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominicans, with no new severe communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesman for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three US officials, including two diplomats who, subject to anonymity, agreed to discuss internal perceptions.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external administration analyst who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is currently publicly available.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also investigated whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on US elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him during preparations for re-examination before the voters and may even be tried before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that decides how long it can last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable descent of democracy.
There are now several such turning points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein's been in trouble ever since we discovered in our paper that last year he offered a covert recording of the president and speculated that he wasn't fit for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the account presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unjust or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court of Justice despite the charges of credible sexual assault and false testimony?
Above all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, elect those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Chechnya Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light a sabbatical candle on that table marked swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how could I not look at the future optimistically?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Research Fellow at the Brookings Institute, is president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
The manager of the Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna match.
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with the Austrians won after the impressive release of Villareal in Spain this month will significantly increase their chances of qualifying with the G League of Europe.
Up to draw 2:2 from Villareal knee injury prevented Assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-olds.
"We went to this game with faith that we will achieve something, and we won the point.
Perhaps in the end we could still press them, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we can score three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent got a good score in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and win a positive score.
Last year was definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings spends sleep on women's eyelids
Although the surveyees knew exactly how they wanted to handle them, few talked to their family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that she had talked to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide selling life insurance.
What do you want me to start with?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your will earlier.
With counsellor and family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask the financial adviser for help: He can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Funding for long - term care may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid to cover such expenses, or on your own property, if any.
Prepare legal documents: this will prevent judicial battalions.
Designate a trusted healthcare officer who will supervise and ensure that the persons concerned act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a financial officer.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent needs medical help in the old age and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give yourself all the information you can to have them prepared.
"This is not just about the finances, but about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
"What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan."
Man repeatedly shot from windshield in Ilfracombe
The man was shot repeatedly from a windshield when he came home from the evening party.
Forty kilos were located in the vicinity of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police identified the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
These injuries do not endanger a man's life. The police are asking witnesses to the event.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday.
Because of broken communication, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal kabupatene, which is north of Palu, near the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about Pal and Donggal’s kabupathy on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017 there were 379,800 people.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami occurred, the city was in the process of celebrating the 40th anniversary of its establishment.
Dongala is a kabupaten (a administrative unit lower than the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main sectors of the Central Celebese economy are fisheries and agriculture, which in particular developed on the banks of the Donggal kabupathy.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but it is mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
In the last 100 years, the earthquake and tsunamis have visited Pal and Donggal several times, according to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disasters.
In 1938, tsunamis that hit Donggal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Dongali.
Indonesia is on an active seismic Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes to occur quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake that visited the western coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of severe earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, a 6.8 - degree earthquake occurred, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: There was a 7.6 - degree earthquake near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
As a result, over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Kabupaten Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the damage that the 2004 earthquake and tsunami caused.
This time there was no tsunami, but the crashing buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Many earthquakes visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its north side.
They destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary problems for thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son, arrested under domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the village of Wasilla at Alaska, 29-year-olds were arrested with allegations of domestic violence, preventing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police to file a criminal report, he took her phone.
KTUU says Palin is in Matt-Su's custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her, he was brought before a court last Saturday, where in his defense speech he said he was “surely innocent. ”
There are three A-class offences on Palin, which means that he can receive a sentence of even a year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He was also charged with an offence of Class B, for which the sentence of the day of imprisonment and fine of $2,000 was punishable.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veteran Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of obstructing the filing of applications and of possession of weapons inadvertently in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who associated his son’s aggressive behavior with a group of post - traumatic stress that he gained during his ministry in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the tsunami following the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of a Friday earthquake that visited the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not functioning and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, located northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media, videos show a moment of disaster.
When the tsunami struck the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival took place.
Federal prosecutors demand death sentences for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding death sentences for Sayfull Saipov's suspected terrorist attack in New York City, which has resulted in eight deaths.
To carry out the attack that took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, Saipov allegedly used a rented truck called Home Depot, which was spread out by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification made in the Southern District of New York about the intention of demanding a death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “targetly” killed eight victims and “targetly” caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court's file, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the federal attack, the jury presented Saip's 22-position indictments, including eight counts of murder in illegal activities — a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organisation of the attack required "sodium planning and reflection". The way Saipov carried out it was described as "disgusting, cruel and immoral".
“Sayfullo Habibullaewic Saipov caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci”, states a notification of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were in New York on tour.
For the last time, ten years ago, the death penalty was imposed in the South District of New York.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually in September 2009 he was sentenced to life.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial documents of the Saips, who came from Uzbekistan, he did not show remorse within months of the attack.
The police say he told the investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment, he confessed to the authorities that he was inspired to attack by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be hanged in his hospital room.
The indictment covering 22 charges is based on the fact that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said that they were "disappointed for obvious reasons" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of prior dismissal after admitting to guilt prolongs only the suffering that these events brought on all concerned," he said.
Saipov's team of defense attorneys had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand death.
The Tory Parliamentary says that Nigel Farage should take responsibility for the negotiations on Brexit
During today's protest that took place during the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A conservative deputy, Peter Bone, told the Birmingham demonstrators that if Farage was the Secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would be out of the Union".
However, the inclusion of the Torys in favour of staying in the community in a separate protest against Brexit, which was held in the city, was even more stressed by the weight of the task of reconciliation of its deeply divided ranks, which are facing Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his plan of compromise with Chequers in the face of attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite objections, she will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "dispose the plan from Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did this, we would be out of the Union now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Addressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “That is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to be our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that the citizens changed their vote in 2016: "I think that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union is completely false."
The demonstration also featured the support of Brexit Andrea Jenkins from a batch of Torys, who told reporters: “I only say: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the whole, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists, who inhabit the streets and who chose us, do not support it either.
Please abandon the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage said that politicians involved in the demonstration must feel "hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell 'em we won't let you do it."
Addressing a distraught crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the edge of the treachery of Brexit feel hot.
"We are mobilizing an army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, the opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two - hour demonstration took place.
The group of activists waved banners "Torys against Brexit" after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis ridiculed conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who claim to be able to organize IT systems and all the technology to support Canada plus, liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "they will seriously consider running for president".
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place Saturday in West Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November. She will be opposed to a Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that in the 2020 elections, Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula, since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government — and she also meant the woman on the top. ”
The arrest of the perpetrator of the death shooting in which the LSU player, Wayde Sims, was killed
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in a Friday shooting, in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 East Time.
On Friday, a video of a shooting was released asking for help in identifying the male visible on it.
Wade Sims, aged 20, was killed as a result of a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with a gun in the head, resulting in his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul according to 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After the arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
He was raised in Baton Rouge with a height of 1.98 m in junior Wayde Sims. He played 32 games, and in the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent 17.4 minutes on average in the parking lot, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 matches.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the command of the Mercedes team would have a great impact on the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service site first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the peletto's tail, which should decide about the race's fate.
The Mercedes’s guide went to the box in the next round and followed Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner part of the track, risking to push the defense after the double movement of the rival to defend the position at the third corner, Hamilton took the lead.
Max Verstappen took off at the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he found himself in the seventh place.
Then, through a large part of the race, he did not change tires to make a quick finish and take Kimia Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service station on the 44th lap, but in the other eight laps, he was unable to accelerate.
"It was a difficult day because throughout the Valtteri weekend he did a great job and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The entire team gave everything to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump called from Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of the letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the Supreme Court of the Supreme Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony filed by Christina Ford before the Commission of the Justice Senate, and instead he found that what happened in the Senate had proved that people were "sad, malicious and lying".
"What could have happened was one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for several days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry, angry and lying," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they say to us, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you disclose this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of that document? --Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal, "No, we didn't reveal," he added, trimming the senator.
Diana Feinstein received from Christina Ford a letter describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his content ran out in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's innuendo, I didn't reveal her history," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and I did not disclose these contents in accordance with her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it this way during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing the defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using insinuations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power by all means.
You can see the evil, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over power and control," the president said, according to mediaite news.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with the Dundee Patrick Dwyer club, he scored two goals for the Giants team.
Dundee Stars Club redeemed his Friday victory in Elite League with Belfast Giants, winning a rematch match at its home on Saturday 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a two-brother advantage after shooting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillelier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne settled the score, then Dwyer re-emerged the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard rebalanced the score by winning the Dundee goal, and two goals by Lukas Lundwald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third losing in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won the Dundee team in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season, three first matches won by the Giants.
The opening goal of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaulla's assistant. Four minutes later, Beauvilleier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assistant.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a minute Sullivan introduced the host team back to the game, and then Matt Marquardt leveled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer gave the Giants the upper hand before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first course that night.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard re-balanced the score of a huge win-winning game at 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second course, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen deliver the Dundee team's first advantage in this match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last field by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost four for their last five games will play next Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was shouted by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people aboard.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a major earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
In the area there are still strong secondary shocks. In Pal, many people are trapped in ruins.
Although his colleagues fled, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a crazed air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that Batik Air's plane (flight 6321) was safely off the runway.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports from the Australian ABC News Station, Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonyus left this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"This message has broken our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may reach thousands. National Disaster Management Agency reports that the possibility of reaching the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death is still increasing because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached," said the spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The current six - metre tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News station: “The ambulances constantly bring the bodies.
He's beginning to lack drinking water.
Small stores are rascaled."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re gonna do.
It's already a tragedy, and it could get worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Yoko Vidodo, arrived to Pal, who turned to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to accomplish all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
This year, Indonesia visited an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
The crash of an airplane in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines report that one person is missing after the plane crashed into the lagoon
Flight attendants who crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific report that one person is missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday afternoon, it was impossible to count one man who was traveling on a feral plane.
They made sure that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water during an attempt to land at an airport on Chuuk Island, the local boat was helped to rescue other passengers and crew members.
Officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
Airline said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, nor is its precise course known.
The United States Air Force and Navy say the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of his seat belt.
American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"It helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said that he was able to get through the water that reaches the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, onboard staff panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that Marines who worked nearby to modernize the coast were able to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to about 30 meters deep.
According to the Air Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades of plane crashes registered in Papua New Guinea.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. completed the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how using cell phone records he reopened a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received localization data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on a feral evening.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
On the prosecutor's question about whether Tellis was telling the truth, saying that he was in a truck in Sanford that night, he replied that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact information from her phone, as well as text messages and calls.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
The final defence speech is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it was likely that the case would be referred to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — What Is Conscious of hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the species by filling its music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today's hip-hop has gone from the original political content and social issues.
Team members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
The creation of artists like Akala and Lowkey has recently led to the rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and the Commons in the UK.
Another black one?!
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for firing after a "racist" SMS.
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for releasing her from racist work after receiving a misdirected text in which the mother of the child complains that she is “another black person”.
The couple objected to being racist, comparing the suit to "surprise."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly contrasted when it turned out that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who stood on your first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NOE, COLONEL BLACK PERSON” she wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, by mistake, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to reports in the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that the gaffe had been committed, Giselle Maurice was released, claiming that a loving nanny, who was an African American, was wrong in her duties, and also expected a Filipino nanny.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home to Uber.
He now seeks compensation for an exemption of $350 per day multiplied by six months for which he was initially employed with residence, although he did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," the Post said Friday and added "I know this is discrimination."
The couple objected to the allegations of racism, claiming that the completion of their cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, a husband, told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to the person whom you have wronged, even if it has happened by mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Comparing the suit to “surrender, ” Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months earlier and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Do you intend to blow up something like this?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public opinion quickly handed down sentences in social media, criticising her for her behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books on Paddington feared that readers would feel no connection with the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says of the letter: “It’s hard to stand on the spot of the person who read it for the first time before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She claims that her father, who, before being inspired by a small plush bear to write a book for children, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was certain that his work would be rejected. He adds that after his death last 60th anniversary of the book's publication seemed "sweet and bitter".
Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” says that her father was in hiding proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he did not hesitate," he adds.
“However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had accomplished something — you feel proud of him, although not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was more or less perceived.
Even though he invented it and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After landing her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that it would probably not come out," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I have to say good-bye to her.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that her doctors gave her to keep her heart rate were slowly stopped and were removed from her body.
She died a while earlier, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit here and wait for it to grow.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I had to really hold on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers who were unaware of the pain she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all kinds of compassion for Nada.
I felt I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postage cards from women in mourning help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to divert others from their intention to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help from.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he got depressed, and when he was 18, he took his own life.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a good cook with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew his smile.
They always said they can make every room brighter."
Before his death, however, he gave up his job because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people that you can turn to and you can talk to, even if that's just what you know.
Don't be quiet. Talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
"Nothing said he was feeling depressed, sad or anything," he said.
"For a few days before God's birth, we saw a change in his behavior.
When the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It takes a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked -- a limited investigation and a limited scope -- maybe we could achieve some consensus," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the commission was "falling apart" for the opposite camps, leading to an invasion.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
They're all desirous of the moment.
The election to Congress is in a few weeks — November 6 — if the Republicans are expected to lose it, the chances of choosing a certain individual to the highest court in the country will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush had already picked up the phone to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI reports?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break in and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees from North Korea is smaller
According to the South Korean legislator, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to the South fell.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said that 1,127 escaped last year and in 2011 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates for human smugglers.
Pjongjang did not make a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to the authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the border has illegally exceeded more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
The majority escapes from China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than to cross a strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have improved clearly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks about negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously stood at a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of President Donald Trump of the United States with Kim Jong Un, who took place in Singapore in June. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the goal of clearing the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves as the first," Ri said in a speech he gave before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that he was not naturally fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke these words during an interview she gave Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted this way, she would be considered a 'hysteric'," Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh filed Thursday before the Commission of the Justice Senate.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
For moments during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost shouting and losing his speech when discussing family issues and high school years.
He was also clearly chasing the Democrats from the Commission, laying down the charges against him, "a grotesque and coordinated attack on the reputation" organised by the liberals, who were furious that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from office if he had received the nomination and had the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in this court he currently works in," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears the possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process because it is considered a conservative judge.
During the Kavanaugh trial, he avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be overturned.
"This is not the time to bring in a hysterical, prejudiced person who will expect us to say 'but it's wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to rule it.
It's a proper diatribe, months and years of spilling Fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"That's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company was very helpful to me, and she said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she came up with such a way that when she got nervous and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You must think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are acceptable as an outlet of anger partly because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of the first jobs in a man - dominated office is how one day I began to cry out of unspeakable rage. An elderly woman, a cool manager whom I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and took me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they're hot."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then appointed to the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a boat lover named Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a deliberate decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"The elections were already made by seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has described this situation as 'The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
Since the campaign lasted for a long time, Schroeder was behind in fundraising and promised not to enter the race unless he collected $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to defeat.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, only had 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — gratitude for those who supported her, frustration over the system that had made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and rage at sexism — that she had her voice tied up in her throat.
"You might think I've been through a nervous breakdown," the press said.
"You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"Was she crying?"
What are the benefits of the economic war between the United States and China?
The opening of the US - China economic war was deafening, and while the battle is still going on, the conflict between these countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The first warning was launched this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), which led to the taxation of half of all goods arriving in the USA from China.
Each time, Beijing rejoined in nature, recently raising taxes on American goods worth 60 billion dollars from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to each hit by the United States and does not seem to be expected to give up the other economy in the world soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but a public bow before the United States would be too embarrassing for President Chin, Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could in the long run strengthen China, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that the rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for opening up economic chaos in a country is in fact far more dangerous than the observers have previously granted”, said Abigail Grace, a researcher who deals with Asia in the think tank of the Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government claims Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, said the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic developments in their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
The United Nations estimates that since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid subject to conditions or offered by countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory in Ryder Cup Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European land, the United States has already lost six in a row and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup Cup Cup in Europe.
Europe regained its trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it obtained 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who didn't go well for most of the tournaments, hit the ball from the base straight to the water at 16th PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari flashed through all rounds and became one of four players, who since 1979, when this first tournament took place in the current format, was able to score a score of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spith was eliminated by a score of 5/04 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last fight with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
European winners in Ryder Cup were Spain Sergio Garcia, who already took part in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas believed in me and chose me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
This is the success of the entire team and I am glad that I could help," said the moved Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He gives the stick to his cousin, John Rahm, who beat a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a score of 2–1 on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play” said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
It's an unusual statistic, like one of the biggest players of all time who's won 14 major titles and only gave up Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had been having trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing act of American composition, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed some Europeans.
We retreated.
Head hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the organisation of PGA of America and our Commission, Ryder Cup, we will find a way forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm admiring the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
