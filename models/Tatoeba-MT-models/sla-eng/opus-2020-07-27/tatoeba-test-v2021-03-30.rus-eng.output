I can't explain it to you.
He's scared of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He's known her since high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He pulled out a bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagreed.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
It's snowing.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Mary's an idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, either.
Last week, I ran into Tom in Boston.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked cooking.
I told Tom you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what this is supposed to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She goes to school on a bicycle.
I'll pay for it!
Would you like to take the wheel?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're peers.
A coin rolled under the table.
It's empty.
Wash the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here, the rest come out.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
A caravan of 50 camels was rapidly moving in the desert.
You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
I changed places with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not gonna try to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
What are you grinning about?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He went up to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I've decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win again.
The cosmonauts wear suits.
Algeria is buying artillery from Russia.
Should I tell Tom what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why does Tom have to apologize?
The results were shocking.
There's nothing in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We slept under the open sky.
Don't close the door.
When are you free?
Shouldn't Tom have done it on the twentieth of October?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about that report.
When does it start?
Consolation is one of five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made up a name for the newborn yet?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
He'll fix the humpback's grave.
The soup is so hot, it's impossible to eat.
Why is it so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where did you get so hurt?
I don't consider them friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Father's in the garden now.
Harry works part-time at a local supermarket.
Very unlikely I'll be late.
I told them to be in their hats.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where will you be tonight?
Tom locked the door to his bedroom.
I only knew Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom's very good at violin.
No one blames you.
Next year is the year of the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes the bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennis is the only sport Tom has.
Get to the bone.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I went to sleep.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember that I love you.
They say he's a murderer.
Mary didn't want to put an honest costume on Halloween, so she decided to dress like an Amish woman.
Tom lifted his hat.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't do it again, I promise.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's kicking.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom going anywhere without me.
I've been watching you do your job.
He's got great math skills.
On the road.
He's the newlywed's father.
Men were men back then.
The Swiss banks are very secretive.
Once you've completed your mission, you can drink as much as you want.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts have been wasted.
He found himself another glass.
Please, all attention, I'm about to start listening to the patient, make sure they've tracked down the correctness of this procedure, and you're going to have to use it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
Take your eyes out.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite film player?
So I didn't have to ask me twice.
You should go to Boston.
I jumped for joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I don't see you and Tom much.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
This is the house I live in.
I go to school with him.
I can tell by your face that you disagree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a broken plate.
I can't let him go alone.

We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
It's my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not expensive, I'll buy her.
I told Tom what to do.
She almost drowned.
That was a good movie.
You're a bubbly?
I'll never let you forget that.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave his will to anger.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you pee?
I know you work for them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white skater on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
It helps a little.
The cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom added Mary's wet towel to his forehead.
He hurt his left arm.
She's Italian?
We want to leave.
The city ' s population is shrinking with each year.
Dan didn't want to seem too subtle.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two photos?
I've never seen so many books collected in one place.
You look a little depressed.

Cats have shish tongues.
I would never do that.
Fix it, please.
We need to attach an ice pack to the ankle to reduce the swelling.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Have another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you by nationality?" "Argentines."
Why are you sad?
I can do this a lot better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The Zontic is broken.
Tom put his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
So we have to change our plans.
Somebody bit him.
Anything else you want to know?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's your new dress, Mary?
His face was scared.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in a car accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origins are unknown.
Smell that.
Tom is awakened from deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do this.
I hope to see him Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why it happened.
We'll send them a postcard.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look to the left and to the right, before you cross the road.
Tom was my friend, too.
I didn't know her at the time.
We've heard those promises before.
What were you and Tom doing after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
How often this happens, today Mike is late for his meeting.
Tom told me Mary has a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools broke a law prohibiting violations of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his eyes.
I didn't give it to Tom.
There are strange rumors.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred bucks on a trip.
He served in the Navy.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom wrinkled his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to waste it.
He got in the car and drove away.
Tell Tom about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom's had a toothache for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
This is the girl who came in yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
I thought you said it was yours.
Where did he get these shoes?
Don't make me do this.
What are you smiling at?
Tom usually gets to work on a bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've worked with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Is that what I think?
Everybody's got a hat besides Tom.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that for sale?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a flushing bough in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I have your car for a second?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I did that when I was a kid.
There's something very good going on today.
What are you talking about?
Don't go into other people's business.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for sight.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She was saving herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
It's half-third now.
Left strong.
I had to make sure he came here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the cap.
Why don't we take a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.

Have you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom regrets leaving Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks so much French.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
Aren't you singing with us?
Tom lives in Australia with a wife and three children.
I barely got on the train.
I don't like arguing.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house over the hill.
It was Sunday, and I did not get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you all right now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom's done 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom the post office, she threw a glass of wine through him, and with a firm step she left the restaurant, a dead silence reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna have a treat tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought it was a long time for all of us to meet.
Everybody's interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of.
Please just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what luck is called.
It was so dark in the room that I had to go through my senses.
How many aircraft carriers in the U.S. Army?
Is she your teacher?
Sing it again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom understands he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in bitter winters.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where it is.
Tom was supposed to tell Mary.
Why is everybody looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you this would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You've taught me a lot.
What time do you wake up?
Get the garbage out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy a candle?
Canada is an ice hockey family.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
A thief broke through a window.
Spiders are disgusting little things.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without ears like salt-free soup.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
There's been so much going on today.
I saw a car crash a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired to death.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, that I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept squeezing her.
Six goes to the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom wasn't dancing with Mary.
I saw a man eat from a garbage can yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I need to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
You signed a contract?
I told him to talk to his lawyer.
Did they get on the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semitic.
What is your strongest point?
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
I wonder, when Angelica Agurbas sang a song to Neclayev, could she imagine that he would run for presidents?

Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being honest.
The Fom should be there by two-thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely poor.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived despite the destruction of the building.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant is burned down.
John's careless, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom got Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's that guy?
Keep the kids away from the pond.
We'll talk about it tonight.

Get off!
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom starts drinking a lot.
I barely understood him.
He escaped bait.
You can live in a big house and still not feel trapped.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do it yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What were you going to say?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have a word with Tom?
Don't sound like that.
When did Tom get arrested?
We're leaving at six.
The deer was the victim of a lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to talk her out of helping us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
The log may be in the water for ten years, but it will not make it a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I don't think there can be any other reason but that.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man as many years as he feels and a woman as he looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everyone seems happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like walking down the river.
You can come with me.
This dictionary is a big gift for us.
“How long until dinner?” “Five minutes”.
Let her know.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom got on his bike and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him till 10:00.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes into his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How French is it going to be "before the date"?
It wasn't that expensive.
What's wrong with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend that much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that the world disappears in one language a week.
She has a little advantage.

I think you did great.
We had a heavy rain last night.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed the door was open.
That's when I hurt my nudist.
There's nothing more to tell me about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She sat on a chair and read a magazine.
From this point on, crying is prohibited.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to a monkey.
Eat my chocolate? Don't even think!!
Dressed in white, the house looks bigger.
I had difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you were familiar with her.
What is the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me Tom spoke French.
Tom's going back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I watched a French movie with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom played well.
He only blames others, he never blames himself.
Can you play a banjo?
Tom came over to Mary's and hugged her.
"Are you back?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete the construction of my house.
I was annoyed.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to be at his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she was going to be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom's probably gonna win.
What would you like for Santa to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventure?
What are you mad at me for?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met.
Something tells me you're right.
That's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit over there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, you have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy that.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put him on the shelf.
I thought you'd found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You tricked us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's pointless to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
To finish him off, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom doesn't seem to recognize you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Keep it.
Do you read anything besides the Bible?
Read me the meter at the boiler.

The law is on my side.
So I had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication was on the day of the professor ' s birth.
You've been on the phone a few times while you were in the shower.
She married him for money.
Not every bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
Check, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
It's your birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I uploaded on the Internet.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Have you been drinking?
He's certainly the best person for this job.
You're making my job easier.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm loved.
It's not like you're very busy.
Deadline's through.
You look a lot like me.
You know those men?
Tom came out of the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
This probably didn't happen.
You finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary spoke for at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How much do you need a tie?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last of the rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a burqa on your hands.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took my place.
I wanted to talk about it.
I shouted for help.
Can You Explain Your Answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.
Why won't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They cut off Tom's life support.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I just do?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other everything.
I'm never happy.
Tom's both younger than you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm gonna marry a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat you can get from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say so first?
Your grandmother is a lovely lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour trip got me all wrapped up.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Eda!
Did you help Tom wash the windows?
It's out of my hands.
That was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm not here anymore.
Don't tell him what really happened.
I'm not gonna just give it to you.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?

Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary's.
I didn't have time to do that today.

This soup gives up fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I taught French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a horrendous, Jewish sense of the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the inability of the claim of a sacred language that is particularly close to God in prayer.
Eventually, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So we paid 300 dollars for that.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast's not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to get you something to eat.

And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
Is that my book?
Rubbish is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.

Someone said something, but I couldn't figure it out.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great use to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half a third.
It's not the god of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm having a big time.
Tom wasn't polite with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what that's supposed to do.
Give her my regards.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
Peace is cruel.
I'm having a good dream.
That's why there's no business to anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzuoka.
Tom burned all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.

Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our life, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted out of the company.

We need action, not words.

Shall we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.

If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, right?
Let us know, please.
Tom sneezed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Does it hurt somewhere?
He couldn't leave because of his lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can be trusted.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple rotten.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a shame when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think about you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone bothered me.
The river flows well.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He gave no comment on the facts.
He was dark green.
He'll definitely come.
Is there a message?
I got a call from Tom yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.

She doesn't like my manners.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.

How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
You're studying English?
Are you my enemy?

I know what Tom wants you to do.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.

I have an assignment for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about him?
When I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Do not believe any of the things he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.

Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's in school by late night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left his keys to Mary.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foresaw reconciliation in Jesus Christ of royal authority and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went home.
It's fine, but it doesn't break.
It's all a little silly.
Right now, I don't know what I want.
That's amazing.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five in favour of the divers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom in?
Tom said I'm not beautiful.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Find anything interesting?
Everyone's doing it.
I visit my family a lot.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
It's not transparent.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll follow you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important you understand.
Times may change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Tom will be teaching French next year.
I listened to her until the end.
I told Tom to rest.
Why are you angry?
The worst part of the trip is already in the back.
We're gonna miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her on the shoulder.
Don't you speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really needed this knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
I'd like to make a difference.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a white girl in a wheel.
He never got over it.
Don't you want to come with us?
Tom can swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censoring spell is still working!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no saving her.
I'm sorry I didn't do it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary again for forgiveness.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He never was.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like this before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How are they taking you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is in danger.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
It was a difficult decision to make.
I thought you might want a drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
That's why you didn't have to leave.
Mary got better after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody likes me.
Too bad I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom know." "Did you tell him?" "No, he knew it all by himself."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I speak French.
I'm just sure you were just thinking about something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like best in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the crying Eve.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom cheated on me, so did Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river's been plowing now.
A strong wind of silence at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him to.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip away.
Mountain green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go to your father and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
The people of the tribe moved along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
Nobody cares before she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"How did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When are you going to remove the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any point in doing this?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's small, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find it, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in a crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's a yoghurt.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll get it later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat. lt's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your temper.
Why is Tom mad?
What a terrible man!
The chart will be leaking the papers.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
His great-grandfather Tom was born blind.
Tom's older than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easily afraid.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shaky.
What do you expect of Tom?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was going on.
Mary wore boots to her knees.
That's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awful bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can get you on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was the first.
They're all different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put a tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom will fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Small pots have long handles.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.

It'll make your family miserable.
I was very nervous.

I have to win.
It's useless to ask for his help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You have to try not to fall asleep.
My mother's very helpful.
Tom's got a snake tattooed on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Get on the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country's talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy happiness.

On the chairs of the cat.

Be realistic.

Could you tie it up with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

We must respect their wishes.
How did you talk her into it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the very depths of the audience.
You'll live.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie before?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.

Texting, driving, is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.

I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The pitchfork was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Phom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to crush me.
I was very calm.
There's nothing to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.

We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?

Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds did not fly.

What did Tom ask you?
I told him you came to Australia.
Is that what you were looking for?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What should we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired from his wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm up the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom hardly ever asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather like?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told 'cause Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living in the city?
How long have you had?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
What's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves in three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cell.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way above Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas came out of the door.
My dad's an English teacher.
For Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can the vicious circle of evidence be used and appreciated.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I was speaking to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and I couldn't get these baboons to understand their own language.

I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll get it.
My mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Owls are nice.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of a job.
We're perfect for each other.
French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must be missing her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
How much time is in Tokyo now?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
Nobody knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't get a second chance like this.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to be paid for.
She's bloated.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's takin' Mary's hair off.
Tom didn't make me happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyest person I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I love Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
Here's the check.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating of castrel and pan.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out now.
May I see your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas from you for replacing the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to be married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I certainly didn't know where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's bling out.
He dictated a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in a pajama?
How much is that?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
The lynx weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom and half a third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want, in Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, chicken!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two hours of the night.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say the film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I put the milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're messed up.
I didn't know it was gonna be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you move it?
Does Tom speak French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put that back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom made Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary to defend himself.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll take the top of the mountain.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to do the job.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw that?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes flashed and sparkled, and his pale face was usually revived and turned yellow.
What kind of pizza do you like best?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Have some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands are out of the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it with caution.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power in Tom's hands.
I've learned to practice and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
Wasn't it all of a sudden?
Tom said he didn't want to waste that much time.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's pirate costume.
That's the truth!
Let's go to the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
So I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you a fan?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he thinks he is?
King Harald Gormsson, known as Harald Sinezubi, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You need to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He wears a black coat.
I forgot to pour the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Gess.
To tell you the truth, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought before a court, it is generally accepted that twelve persons be included in the jury court.
What exactly did Tom do at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, hurry up, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays trombones.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these ghosts?
The castle is broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want better.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from self - esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice encountered, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war; it was a gushing noise, so sharp as to break her drums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why we can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My car's broken.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying very hard to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As he wakes up, he will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people sometimes look up to the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
Obejana climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your kid can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom, I have the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
How long it's going to fly!
How much money do you have?
Can you solve that question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why should we do so?
In the twenty-floor building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have any photos of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he'd followed my advice then he'd be a rich man now.
I've made up my own mind.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning on going home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as hell.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got a little sutures.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd better stay.
So it was a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is fine.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go anywhere else.
Tom was a terrible observer.
Tom's face lighted up.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom got here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, there was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
How far do you want to go?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped So do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are precious.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good to the animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try it again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you all dressed up?
Milk can be made of oil, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, do not forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as they all expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow avalanche is to blame.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?

Is it gonna hurt?

Tell them we're leaving.

I closed the door, but didn't lock it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary in public.

Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
I'll give the parade!

Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't help but start singing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The stain still left a mark on the coat.

Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you came back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?

Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret later.
Do you envy her?
I hope I can stay here a long time.
Payments will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

Why did you say that?

There are no exceptions to the esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.

There's a shopping area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.

Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
There's no answer.
We should call him.
Are you busy?
I had a negative bump in my head.
Tom, you're being called.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he was coming back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying mouse?
She's gonna take you to the airport.

I'm not gonna complain.

Her manner of talking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do this.

That's not surprising.
The rabbit's bleeding out of his ear.
Postmodernism differs from modernism.
I've read that book before.

That's amazing.
The sky is covered with fights.
This bird is threatened with extinction.

He said he'd be right back.
They have a great deal of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hat.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.

There's nothing.
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Did you take your medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he make up his pants?
I can't tell him from my brother.

I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train will take about two minutes at this station.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think the safest thing would be?

“You can’t wear it.” “Why not?”
Tom did a bad job.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.

In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not riding a car.
As it turned out here, it's impossible to know now.
Tom has his own room now.
I didn't recognize her at first.
Many voices were fabricated.

I think we're almost ready.
A woman came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My puppy died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's above her sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
The most beautiful colors have the sharpest spikes.
You better hide.
Tom is following instructions.
That's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told themselves not to do it.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I've been waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have some coffee or something.
There's something in your pockets, isn't there?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
Sam saw that helicopter and took it with his hands.
I'm with you.

Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're useless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom will be working this weekend.
Tell her, please, that I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
Attempts by the President to introduce more stringent arms control once and for all have been intercepted by powerful weapons lobbying.
I think we know each other.
You're underestimating Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to put it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have plenty of time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father's a good cook.
Is there something else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one's paying attention to me.
So there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay up front.
You made coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're bigger than Spartacus!
That's how he performed his celebration.
Why was he in need of Tom?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bitter.
There was no time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did this on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
The network, the transfer.
I used to live in Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networking enables us to find a lot of information about a person before we meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What Is the Purpose of Learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black spots can be removed.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me get this.
I can't forgive his lazyness.
Tell me you're joking!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you in uniform?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the street from the snow.
Tom and Mary have to do it together.
They offered to help us.
Tom firmly decided to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's gonna happen to him?
Tom and I are friends of old.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
It's like a celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want that dog.
Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I made Tom dinner.
Russia has become a second superstate.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Dissolve this powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's get one of those ready lunches sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him on the spot.
How did you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $4,000 per month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy that car?
You sound like my grandma.
I don't have any brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think that's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop right there!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You should consider his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom's starting to suspect something's wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Aren't you gonna turn the radio off?
I certainly don't remember what Tom said.
Tom is a seasoned player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a vivid imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
Yesterday, you left the bar just the moment I was going to give everyone a drink at my expense.
Tom told me it worked.
I want to play chess.
I support you a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We don't have much snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate to wait.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
Yesterday was fun.
Where did Tom get these photos?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom kicked him.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
You're the only one who can handle the money.
How do you relate to each other?
I could've done it a lot faster, Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where did Tom sleep?

She told me she didn't eat pork.
Now you can get out of the room.
Tom learned a new word.
She spoke French.
I'm glad you're here now, Tom.
Where did she find that book?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
You should have breakfast.
So what do you want to know?
Tom didn't go, so did I.
Choose your expressions.
He just got back.
Mary laughed funny.
You'll have to wait here.
I'm tired of hearing your complaints.
Tom and Mary, as usual, were wasting their time.
Please tell them it's urgent.
You'd be fine for this job.
How's Tom doing?
We gave her some apples.
I'm not naive.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you describe Tom briefly?
I had to tell Tom to wait.
Please wish me luck.
I'm glad he's alive.
Tom was waiting for me in the parking lot.
I didn't want to make him cry.
I saw Mary before she saw me.

Drive right on this road.
It's almost winter.
My grandfather was a soldier in the war.
I was there when Tom died.
Tom's had lunch yet?
You can buy a train ticket.
I'm very proud of my parents.
I was joking before that.
I don't know if Tom has a bike or not.
Don't make me lose my patience.
I love a lot of things.
I don't think you should do this alone.
Tom's really dangerous.
It's not his wife.
We won't be able to drive anymore.
How long do I have to wait?
I don't think I need anyone's permission to do that.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through your nose.
Look at this from her point of view.
Tom wasn't the only one who wasn't swimming.
He has a literary talent.
God can do anything!
Bring the kids.
Tom thought you knew Mary.
Tom knew I wouldn't do it.
I'm very lucky.
Tom's in a bad mood today.
I didn't mean to offend them.
He looks weird.
Are there any victims?
I'm wasting my time building air locks.
We all love you.
Here and now.
I'm not very disappointed.
I don't smoke or drink.
She's in charge here.
The police haven't questioned Tom yet.
I knew you wouldn't have enough money.
Criticism cannot be avoided.
Please tell me it's not a bomb.
I don't want to bump into Tom.
I took the train.
I applauded.
I forgot to pour flowers.
Tom got his stuff and left.
She talks about you all the time.
I respect you and Tom.
I fell asleep on the train.
Tom made his own decision.
I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're impartial.
Tom brushes his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom used to talk to women.
Let's determine our location before we go any further.
She called me the next day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for $300.
What did that mean?
You should have told me in advance.
I have a crossword in my garden.
He's looking for a job.
I'm looking for my cat.
I had to ask her first.
Enjoy the moment!
Who ate all the cookies?
We'll fix it.
Mary finally found her keys.
This information strengthened it in its opinion.
The worst enemy and man's best friend is another man.
Tom wanted Mary to get him something to eat.
Don't wait for dinner.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm sorry, I'll just be a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what had to be done.
I know it won't happen today.
I don't think that changes anything.
We had a lake vacation.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom smiled politely.
Rabbits can swim.
I have some money with me.
Our team has a good chance of winning.
One square metre of solar power is produced by about one watt of energy, so it is not easy to use solar power on a large scale right now.
Who knows why Tom lied?
Is this new car?
I have a question for you.
Trained ten minutes from here.
Who are you to decide that?
Feel the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you tonight.
What are your plans for the weekend?
We can get caught.
I'm sure he'll go.
Go ask him.
Let me see.
Private charity is just a drop at sea.
I agreed to have a drink with Tom after work.
I wish I had a car like that.
I became a woman.
Tom didn't sleep last night.
Fortunately, Tom had an extra umbrella.
Why'd you take your beard off?
These handiwork objects differ in quality.
Tom came to see Mary.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
She suffers from renal insufficiency.
Give me the flashlight.
Did you tell him he shouldn't go?
Nothing like the ice cream in the summer.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car wasn't moving.
Mary knows she was wrong.
That skirt's too tight.
We'll try to keep calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke fast.
So Mary was not to be deceived.
The baby's in the cradle.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom wiped out the offer and rewrote it.
You could've hurt yourself.
Get out of this room.
You shouldn't smoke while you're working.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary wouldn't let him.
Tom hasn't done anything all week, he's just complaining about Mary's scar.
I don't think the car's broken enough.
Tom approves?
I'd like to be Canadian.
It only happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.
Nobody wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're free to do what you want with your money.
Do you want anything?
She left before I came home.
Tom wasn't the only one arrested.
You could have at least knocked!
You're only doing worse.
I think you should take a break.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee we can finish our work by next Monday.
I didn't do it very well.
Tom really needs you.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papiamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to get cut.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember their name?
I eat couscous.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine sells well.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They were drawing lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like spending time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.
If you take the baby out and point your finger at the moon, the baby will look at the moon, and if you do the same thing with the dog, it will look at your finger.
Tom took a beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
At the end of this year, there will be an economic crisis.
Don't let anyone into the fire.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary the letter he got from John.
"The Psalms are boring," said the girl.
That's what I want, too.
Tom used to teach me French.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the windows.
Can this be acceptable to you?
How am I gonna get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I suggest you put a comma here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do it.
She has a very tense schedule.
Tom speaks French, too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
In the garden flowered tiger lilies.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can.
We're here to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Next!"
One goal in his life is to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
A letter to you.
Grandpa didn't know how to read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom stayed at the hotel for the night.
I explained this to her.
Tom's indecisive.
It's nuclear!
I'll delay my departure if it rains.
It's got to be spotless.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
This is the tallest building I've ever seen.
It's cutting my ear off.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
When mixing three main colors, it's black.
Make yourself at home.
What time do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was a success.
How long is Tom going to be in the hospital?
I want you to be with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You have to respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray fervently.
What are you going to do if there's a war again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold fever is the California gold fever, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I get to meet new people every day.
I want to go out with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom so much.
He responded to his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot that it was April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom bit the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I understand the consequences.
To the east and west, the city divides the river.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Is that why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think it's Tom's fault.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms, it melts.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that that's why we need surgery.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who knocks on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to see you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
What are you up to?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everyone's quiet.
Let the dust settle down.
Why are you so stubborn?
He got stuck in his Chinese teacher, but with all this hormonal stuff, he got stuck in almost every contemporaneous person.
I'm glad to let you know that I've fully recovered.
I've written a lot of suggestions on the esperate.
I like water better than bed.
I can't make an exception.
He's quick to see.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to an attorney.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't turn in.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My dad likes fishing like I do.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has shown himself to be a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better at cooking than I am.
He floats like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've faced this problem before.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I was able to get two tickets to a concert.
He likes to brag about his father’s successful car business.
She's in sunscreen.
Come on, Amelia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Negative times negative is positive.
There's a dead body in the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the grocery store.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s farewell speech made us very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look dreary.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say "girlfriend" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought about it before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is a friend of my father's.
Can I come too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in the city?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He didn't seem to be sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're hot.
So many of them.
He could not give in to the principles.
Mary says she's single.
You're probably gonna be out of here for an hour.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn't mean anything by it.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He was jumping from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold tonight.
I mistakenly put on Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank robbery's been planned up to scratches.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Come on, come on, come on.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take off the phone.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say no to racism.
Tom the butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Do you like any more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You can't answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish alligator from crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
You really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, all right, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think of Tom as my friend.
Counting on being ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't know color.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
We have to tell him not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a vision.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
So you should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something we need to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That's the second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two cases at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone into the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom's asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
It's very nice to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the noise manager at the neighbors.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the benefactors.
You'll meet him when you're new, and you'll spend it.
There's not a single book in French in the library.
Any summation is dangerous, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that to a hiragane, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Be your age, then.
Can you juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't bear the suffering of animals.
I think Tatoeba's pulling up tonight.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is a mess.
The conference room is now busy.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I'm looking forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's boring here.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You've said so much yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been like this.
Can't we fire her?
An artificial satellite was launched into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war starts?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry, Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Papers on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know that better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill should be paid for the first number of the next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
Boston is a cold town for me, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an extortion attempt.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Tom lives far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The dispute ended with a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a reply.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a mule ride along the way.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents, and Tom speaks French with his parents in English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Thomas was not easy to find.
Everybody dances!
I live with Tom.
This is where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you lack patience.
Several events marked the onset of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there's no way to talk about it.
He's out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to get confused in the languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
Sam gave Layla his computer.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can become president, but it probably isn't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first name on the list is Tom.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
How long does this train arrive in Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John had met each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked him cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I invited my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you a little more time to think.
Please translate this into French.
Pick up the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was increasing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Hair and stick it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
That's why I'm gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to pick.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for anyone's help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many broad avenues in this city.
What are you carrying?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make the people do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand the color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never spoke to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got flaws.
I wonder why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you back me up?
What don't you like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have some fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
Titles and rewards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
It's been a long time.
I'll recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Get Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Pull yourself together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him at home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy was running to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She received the highest marks.
Tom might get hot.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color are your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do this.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the outside doppelganger.
I'd like to lie down.
You owe me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
It's only half past nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look so good.
She blew herself up to warm them up.
Tom said it was good to have you back.
My car is covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane's in a holding cell.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary's unconscious.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," said Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in a lot of pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how much time.
They're running away.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the congregation.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal like a message in a bottle: someday it will be translated.
You can't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started winning in her new office.
Let us take care of that.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early for a drink now, isn't it?
My parents don't like my clothes.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom hasn't been down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the kisses.
The show needs to start watching when all seasons are over!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go for a ski ride?
You were in hairdresser?
It's an embarrassing prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone already knew about this.
You'd better go help her.
A football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brakes go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was blown up.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a cocky idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all underpants.
Tom thinks throwing out products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's got whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much was it?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
You know that boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
That's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The stealer's gonna steal the cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of his old self.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true?
Why don't you go over there?
Tom never said he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've heard nothing but good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare yourself to us.
I saw the car explode.
There's a window.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never drop my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell him I'm going to go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to disturb him.
An officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, now I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't know much about hunting.
I'm making grilled meat for the first time.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom is going to pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him looking at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom has to be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I cut myself every month.
I told you, I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple of acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus took the holy fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get off the bus before it burned down.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We take checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were dying in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Eh, it's so boring for you here." "My boy, everything is seeking this world." "Here I am! Your Majesty, Hennon and his servants have captured the island of Corridai." "Hm. What can we..." "How can we do this, it's written that Linc can resist Gannon." "How can we do that?" "Hello! I'll take my sword!" "No." "Oh?" "Oh, no!" "This is the axe with the skull." "No." "How can you take this gun?" "Yes!" "Yes!" "No." "How about the smoke bombs?" "No." "How about the smoke bombs?" "No." "How can you take it?" "How can you take it?" "Yes!"
Do you know who sings that song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing well.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn how to read.
I'm on my way home to Tom.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary put her blankets together.
A is a set of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience that you wanted to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music do you listen to in the car?
That's what they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began at the time of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It'll depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was in a good place.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two large coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food doesn't eat.
It's snowing tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nubes, they don't know anything about computers.

I like your glasses.
The rainwater flows through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I've got insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
Nobody's suggesting you do that.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to stop the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting in the same cell with John.
I didn't mean to swim.
He's had a beer.
In our time, men find it most difficult to be... themselves.
I'll never talk to him again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'll tighten my nosebands.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all children.
She got out of her mind and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The bunnies are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Can you smell the burn rubber?
This isn't what happened here.
When is your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom passed Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's patient.
She didn't buy any bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You must be tired.
We're champions.
Tom's going deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
The boatmaster is the master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the fossils in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all worked out.
Vermont's on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix this, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What chemical sign is indicated by bromohydrochloric acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a courtier.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls cheap?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using them, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't stand a chance of winning.
Are you planning on staying for long?
We ate urgently, and we left at the same time.
There's a big garden out back.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't put anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you about?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The bar was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me I wasn't sure.
May I suggest another strategy?
They died.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand that, Tom?
Walk away, let's go to the car.
You're in my way.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is painful.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go back and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for that book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's a tight coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married at the time.
I bought that book.
naivety is its only positive quality.
My hobby is insect collection.
Tom's kid lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures babies fall asleep under cradles.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to upset you.
Those who have never left their country are filled with prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people, cows are sacred animals in India.
I've got the imagination on.
I thought we could do this.
My mom wouldn't let me drive alone.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's a lot of fish in this river.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
Prisoner released.
What, they said it happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what was wrong with them.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mother finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that one day I'm going to France, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain has stopped. We can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to endure this.
Always take the wrong path.
We're being asked to present ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a melodious siren song to me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like her.
My fingers left a print on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you can help Tom.

He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom hasn't been paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's still light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do that, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is it big?
This medicine will help you.
Cut the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I've been?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I can't trust anyone.
She's a fan of Sex in a Big City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Take good care of him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day’s work.
What's wrong?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She scratched her face when she saw the dog.
He's no higher than me.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
This peach is beautiful.
Do you see it?
Tom's not excited about it.

Here are some letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist of this level would make such a basic mistake.

She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the kitchen upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What do we live for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
That's why I don't like the ending of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him to forgive you.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I don't give a shit about you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom works at the library.
You were in school at the time?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who that was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to postpone the meeting until next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.

Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I sleep a little.
You'll get there someday.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you shouldn't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go in there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows that I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom makes three times as much money as Mary does.
I drank milk.
It's snowing tomorrow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to cooking, no one will compare it to Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg in a shark attack.
I made this for you.
We'll do it as the time goes by.
Next year I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's a little taller than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue belongs to your skin.
I'm in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up playing guitar.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.

They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches higher than Mary's.
I'm glad you suggested it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
That sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why does he need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new car.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's splitting up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give them to him.
You're going to get arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom took the rule of meditation every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure this won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress her.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom meant by that.

Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
The white bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was better than everybody.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do anything a few times.
Let the vessel be washed today by the one who loses in the paper stone-scissors!
I'm such a pain in the ass!
I would never do that.

Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese man would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who I should consult with.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
There's a lot more to do.
Give me one, please.
I don't bring in disobedient children.
Tom bought me this.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She has demonstrated her talents.
I wish it were possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky to be alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the leading role for the first time.
You need to stay in shape.
I've been licking seeds all day.
I got the accent that he's American.
Maybe that's the problem.
Was that a joke?
Be merciful!
Tom obeyed.
All my generation thinks the same way.
I live for it.
Can you skate?
The Duke rules many lands.
At least we're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he hadn't eaten in days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American Politologist."
Get out of here!
If this isn't a home sale, then maybe it's a new way of getting to know the girls?
Tom improved the coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there is no God, it's all allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've waited a long time.
I turned down the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't.
I'll have too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to my summer vacation.
Can we put this another way?
From here he looks great.
Wooden houses burn easily.
Let's roll Tom's party.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a tad.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We talked about what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I get you something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in her dress.
What bird can't fly?
This has to end.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French, too.
The invention of a transistor marked a new era.

Mother's cooking dinner.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son's a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.

He is inclined to give pleasure to his emotions.
We were shocked to hear of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just pointing out the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're to blame for what happened.
It's as accurate as the clock.
I know where you're going.
You get it all on the summer.
Let's get him up.
Let's just leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing is wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The janitor hung up on me.
It's a cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't chrome anymore.
Tom was a busy smoker.
Tom wore gloves.
It's hard talking to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I wonder who'll help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you with something?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you think you couldn't?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
Is she out of her mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's running his carnage.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not speaking on the waist at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed in tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Yeah, where you want to put it.
They didn't make it in time.
It's now seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said it to Tom.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died long ago.
I usually climb one step at a time.
Tom gave up that year.
I'm at the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You're gonna pay for what you did.
I'm losing it today.
I asked them to stay out of this.
Tom only learned how to drive in thirty years.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut meat, so I used my washing knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adapt to village life.
Keep a bucket near the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
This is where the river gets deeper.
I thank you from my heart.
I've told you this a hundred times.
I'm so cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They died.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Write words separately when they are to be written in a language that is largely a problem in Norwegian.

This book is worth reading.

You're always so romantic.
The wife is not an ass. You can't get off your feet.
I'll pick you up at six.
I teach therefore French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary has curry eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom's planning on staying in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
What did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like the fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate eggs.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave the gun to Mary.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first ones to get on the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you about time to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to it.
Tom was sitting on his feet.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning strikes twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make up your own mind.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree we cut down and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom to never write my daughter again.
Rabbits multiply quickly.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
What's the cost of cleaning your coat?
We'll decorate it.
It's a narrow opening.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me honestly.
I'll come into whatever it takes.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the application.
Did you try to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?

You're gonna have to do this even if you don't want to.
Who here can't do that?
It's time to learn German.
How long have you and Tom been skiing?
Don't you like your name?
That's what Tom's most afraid of.
Tell him he shouldn't do this.
No one can do this job better than Tom.
There's someone in your room.
Let's talk about this now!
I hate advertising.
Are you being tormented by nightmares again?
I suggest you take the bus.
You shouldn't do this without permission.
You just have to wait.
Are you really scared?
Tom didn't look sad at all.
Do you understand anything Tom said?
We don't plan on doing this anymore.
Fresh mushrooms are so delicious.
You're too young.
Tom probably knew what to do.
Our meetings hardly ever start on time.
I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.
The windows of our hotel come out on the ocean.

Put a sheet of paper in half.
Did you know Tom had three brothers?
Tom felt completely defenseless.
We wouldn't be surprised.
Make sure Tom doesn't run away.
You told Tom what you think?
I drank tea without sugar because I wanted to lose weight.
I'm ready, aren't you?
So far, deep ocean layers have barely been studied.
In an hour we'll all be asleep.
Before we go in, we need to get out of here.
There's no place like that.
Do all birds have pussies?
Do it now.
Perhaps that is what all of us should do.
Have you seen Tom since?
I read the paper sometimes.
Why do you live with Tom?
After all, I decided not to offer myself for this job.
He likes to go to parties.
How long have you been skiing?
You'll never wake me again.
Tom told you that himself?
We all love you very much.
According to experts, this is unlikely to happen.
I never said she stole my money.
You can take my car whenever you want.
He can't be trusted in anything.
If she knew his phone number, she could have called him.
Tom helped me milk the cows.
He teaches me Dutch.
You think that's right?
Is anyone visiting her?
Who did you just call?
Tom is not a proper name for a wizard.
It makes me very sad.
No one in their right mind would do that.
My son is too thin.
Most of it's true.
Call Tom and tell him.
I don't think I've ever seen them before.
Do not let Him eat or drink.
Who told Tom I was here?
Did you go anywhere yesterday?
Our wedding will take place next Monday.
Grandpa Toma served in Wehrmacht.

Tom likes to speak frankly.
That's very few people can do.

I teach him Dutch.
These chains are very warm.
What don't you like about winter?

Now all we need are volunteers.
I didn't promise you that.
Do you know why Tom didn't come today?
The first thing you have to do is contact Tom.

Who opened the windows?

The knife's a good cut.
Tom might be coming today.

Suggestions are made out of words.
Has anyone seen Tom today?
If I were you, I'd help Tom.
I've noticed that before.
Which of the boys is the most capable?
I haven't seen my ex-wife since our divorce.
It was by love that I wanted to marry her.
Can coffee cause a headache?
Tom and I used to be friends.
I'd like to know his name.
That's not my daughter.
I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.
Ask someone else.
Is Tom always like this?
I thought you were gonna tell Tom to do it.
Tom's waiting for you there.
I hope you understand.
I'd do the same if I were you.
Tom slept before noon today.
Tom has to leave at some point.
Where's the cemetery?
Why do I make stupid mistakes all the time?
Even the experts were wrong.
You want the same thing?
We need to be ready for what might happen.
I want everyone to envy me.
Tom said he wanted to stay in bed.
Tom will be gone as soon as he can.
I'll help you, and that's why I won't.
If I were you, I'd ask him.
I like you a lot more than I used to.

Did you ride a bike last night?
The adult has both his eyes on the same side of his face.

As expected, Tom wasn't there.

Did you tell everyone I was here?
I hope you haven't forgotten to invite Tom.
We like chocolate milk.
Tom's not experienced yet.
I can't believe you didn't see Tom there.
