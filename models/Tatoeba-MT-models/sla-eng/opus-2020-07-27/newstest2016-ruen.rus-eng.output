The Social Map of the People of Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a travel allowance in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the organization of concessional travel of citizens using the social map of the resident of the Ivanov region.
According to the Russian Government's press service on the Ivanovsky area, the changes provide for the continuation of public passenger travel benefits and bring the social card accounts scheme into line with Federal Act No. 161 of the Federal Act on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social map of the resident of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the replenishment limit is now set not in the previous travel, but in the amount of cash, with winter and summer periods of no more than 400 roubles in winter, during summer periods not more than 800 roubles for the current month.
The social card holders will now need to monitor, not the remaining travel, but the balance of the money, on the receipts issued in the transport.
The cost of a concessional tour for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for the replenishment of the social map by money remains the same, from 24 times the previous month to 23 times the current month.
The new social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed accounting of the spending of money on a social map with accuracy up to the copies.
In addition, it is possible to recover accrued but unexpended funds.
Add that the scheme of accounts with carriers becomes transparent, as half of the cost of travel is now paid by the citizen and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged on a cash map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of Ivanov Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million visits were made in the region using a social map, in 2015 almost 25 million visits.
More than 470 million roubles are provided in the regional budget for the provision of concessional travel of citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, over 312 million roubles had been reimbursed.
At the time of the 911 call, a teacher admits to killing a friend
At the time of the 911 call, the police professor, Shannon Lamb, told the police, that he had shot his girlfriend, and that it was necessary for staff members to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house that was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the deceased's family could be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was carelessly written from her hand on a white paper sheet: “I am very sorry, I would like to bring it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me,” the note said, according to representatives of the organs signed by the Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to travel 300 miles to a university campus where the police believed he had shot all of Ethan Schmidt's respected history teacher at the threshold of his cabinet.
Delta State Police Chief Lynn Baford reported that the university staff found out about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real 911 call shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more thing: Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police had surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the officers of the authorities were still trying to draw a single picture of the motives for Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to create a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told us that they were looking forward to his training.
The Goth police, where Prentiss died, reported that there were no allegations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his written book, in which he expressed his appreciation for the “beautiful people” with whom he intertwined in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of the same kind.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamba, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, as if there was something wrong with him.
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 how he was struggling with stress.
Before, Lamb asked the University of Delta to give him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the degree of doctor working so hard for Lamb would not automatically guarantee him the position of teacher.
The president of William Laforge University reported that he knew nothing about the Lamb-Smidt conflict, but “obviously, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind.”
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lomb after he fled campus when he was headed back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, was reported by Washington Mayor Metel Johnson.
His engine car was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, though, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb started working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctor's degree in pedagogical science in the spring of that year.
A longtime friend of Lamba described him as a wise, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston told me that she was 15 years old and Lambu was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy older than that who had been trying to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
In those years, he enjoyed success among women.
All the girls kept secret when he was around," says Herrston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss may have been dating for a while by the time they were here.
At the time of the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lighting, who lived with them in Gotja in a brick house, the opposite side of which goes out into the canal.
According to the police, there's nothing wrong with the dog.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, said they divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and they have a daughter now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin told me about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and he was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts together from time to time.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and the joint coordinator of the entertainment program in a tightly lit bar at The Julet Room in Gothier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of 5 September, when Lamb had finished playing guitar and lipstick for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and were teasing each other.
I mean, they were both very smart.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial candle-burning ceremony at the University of Delta University in Cleveland.
Schmidt Liz's wife and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The classes resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
Crisis over.
Today's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Reports helped prepare Associated Press authors Emily Wagner Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that Lamb's call came after Schmidt's murder 911 and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not employ the same staff for the holiday season as it did last year, with a retailer of toys and children's goods making sure that it will allow staff and temporary staff to work for more than an hour.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and offshore bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be in part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with candidates this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although several months before the holidays, the purchasing season is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough stock in stores and on sale, shipping and delivery.
Michael J. Fox is joking about the "fate" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to Future" proved to be a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and I was autumned here, and Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer to the soon-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-to-be-back documentary.
The movie is starting, and here I'm thinking that I'm literally at a distance of my arms out and in one false rabbit from seeing Princess Welsh.
"Back in Time" - a documentary on "Back to Future" - includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The premiere of the movie "Back to the Future" was held 30 years ago.
"To me," says Spielberg, "it's undoubtedly the greatest movie of time travel that's ever been filmed."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN head declares that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon responds to Russia's military support for Syria, which for nearly five years is “no military solution” and the increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN head again called upon all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as between the Syrians and the local authorities, had “made the situation unresolved”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 results that show that Donald Trump is not joking
Some tried to put a provocative label on it.
Others turned away from him by taking it as a joke.
And some people need a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated Donald Trump's advantage in two significant figures, and some are seriously asking what this means for the real estate magnet in terms of the chance to get the nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rika Perry had given up his assets to German Kane, none of whom had won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's “Competition of Political Action” and the economic conservative group "Club of Growth" recognize Trump's undiminished power and begin to receive their dollars to push him away.
Here are some of the numbers of interviews that say that the real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump have spread to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 republicans were favourably familiar with this real estate magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, that was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 republicans now favor Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all of these are coming to the top in the early stages.
Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans were members of Trump.
Two thirds of those voting for the GOP would have made Trump a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either “awesome” or “pleasing” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "disturbed" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be “excited” against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if the Jeb Bush design favourite becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper to be a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of voters all over the country think that the magnet has the appropriate temperament to be president, as ABC News/Washington post polled Monday.
The same figure appears in the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think that it has the same person who may be chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put their hats on, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were placed on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: Voters of the GOP had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate, Mitta Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many electors of the GOP find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to come together around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts suggest that such dispersion is likely to play for Trump's advantage, while the non-supporting Trump is evenly distributed among the more than a dozen other candidates.
But the survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition “one by one” between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives the support of the majority.
He beats Carly Fiorina to 13 points, Marco Rubio to 14 points, Walker to 15 points, Jeb Bush to 19 points, and finally Randa Paula, John Kesic and Chris Kristi to 33 points.
He's got no Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to go around him?
Ben Carson ran a 19-point business guy in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT survey Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump named immigrants from Mexico "violents" two months ago in his campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become most relevant in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will deter key voters of Latin American origin from the republican party and prevent renegotiation.
But according to an ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from approximately half of Republican voters, mainly due to their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 republicans on Monday, the new ABC/Post survey, state that they prefer a political outsider than a person with experience in government work.
And they're also insulted in Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent “dissatisfied” and 21 per cent “in rage”.
The Government will decide on the fate of pension indices in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec stated that the government is now looking for options to implement the pension indexation law in 2016 to a real level of inflation, she referred to the WP.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the cabmine discusses the option of prolonging a decision on the freezing of Russian stockpiling pensions.
Hungerer noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
The same is true for the full indexation of pensions next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Hudec believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply, it is not entirely fair that he is being paid for by society to socially disadvantaged categories of citizens.
Previously, the media reported that two options for balancing the budget were being considered in the Cabinet.
Why is it that centuries of anger and redness are common?
Tatyana Levashov's ophthalmologist answers:
Our centuries are the rays that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that lie on them.
As we forget the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffing.
Easy output:
Don't rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special damp napkin for centuries.
at least 1-2 times a day, cleanse the edge of the century of the harmful substances stored therein.
Clearing procedures are not enough to supplement the warm compresses with treatable herbs (sharp, Roma) that fertilize the thick secret of salt glands and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular motions of fingertips;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol - containing agents.
They dry and decontaminate the skin and contribute to further thickening of the secret of salt glands.
Phinehas claims that Korean nuclear weapons have created nuclear warheads.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonben, is “full power”.
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in both quantity and quality”.
The North Korean authorities conducted the latest nuclear arms test in 2013.
However, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Phinehas claims that he managed to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also tested medium- and low-range missiles on several occasions, says Polit.ru.
Zyrinovsky demanded that the Russian hymn be removed from his memory of the brotherly peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Jirinovsky believes that the national anthem should remove the mention of the union of brotherly peoples.
He made this statement during the meeting of the State, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," said Jirinovski.
The MP believes that all four-pronged persons should be removed, which includes this line:
In the summer of 2014, Jirinovski stated that the current anthem should be replaced by "God, the King of the Food", and the Russian trichloride replaced by an imperial flag, says Polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad urged all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Asad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people are killed, as long as bloodshed continues, and until people feel safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Asad stressed.
It is recalled that some 500,000 migrants, including from Syria, arrived in the countries of the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest since the Second World War.
It is not excluded that the arrivals of migrants may include thousands of extremist fighters of the “Islamic State”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city had a feast for refugees.
In the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain the floods.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts refer to significant figures.
More than 90,000 refugees had already arrived in the country since early September.
Bi-bi-si correspondent Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, a town where migrants receive a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin is debuting at the Prime Minister's session.
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his arrival at the session of the Prime Minister's affairs is expected with great anticipation
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak at the Prime Minister's session for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin would address the first of the six outstanding issues in the afternoon; he was likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after the appointment of his shadow office and his speeches at the annual Congress of the Tred Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour to remain silent during the national anthem on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a state anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbin, the Spokesman, stated that he was “standing in a respectful silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in Battle for Britain”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's shadow office informed BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing a national anthem “independent” from his belief in the need for the abolition of the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play Mr. Corbin's team, arguing about economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences would also be “buried” by Labour parties after Mr. Corbin was appointed to the European Union and limited by the Government to compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Tred Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at lifting the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that there was “full clarity” in the party that it was in opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of Labour, with whom David Cameron will meet with the courier box in the last ten years since becoming the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, declares that he has “increased collective resources” in order to acquire the ideas of Mr. Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Parliamentary member from Eilington North said that the Prime Minister ' s questions were excessively confrontational and that he would refrain from insidious responses and exchange of temperaments, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in a shadow office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had approached the Chamber of Commons speaker John Bercoe to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to get away from the political style of the ballad, often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister's issues, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions have become a key indicator for the Prime Minister ' s views, their ability to manage the Community Palace and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics have said that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Stolen in Yoburg" Homeless Young People Studyed on Photographers
Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former street guards found a way to win a trade and make a living.
"I was filmed in Yoburge" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhood and make money on it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling increases as wages rise in Britain
The pound went up against the growth of wages in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index raised as a result of the SABMiller purchase proposal.
Between May and June, earnings in Britain, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to an earlier period of projections for the possible growth of cathartics.
The sterling pound increased by more than 1% over the dollar, representing $1,5505, and 0.84% over the euro, representing €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller shares increased by 20 per cent thanks to the purchase proposal from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stock grew by 0.9 per cent against the backdrop of encouraging news from the competing group of products from the Richemont class.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China, in the key market for Burberry, had begun to grow again.
Glencore stock grew by 5% after the mining giant declared that he had been able to obtain $2.5 billion through stock allocations, which had been done under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group shares were the leaders of the fall in the index - 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sale".
Shares of JD Sports grew after a sports clothing supplier reported 83 per cent growth to a half-year tax of £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can interfere with expansions
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “greater purchasing power in potential consumers’ pockets”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the cost of labour costs, he says.
The cost could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
At the bottom, the wholesale food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGAs in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming injection of $700 million by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale stores and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the following year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social networks and at Adelaide Show events.
Retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream producer Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tastings in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell discount tickets to the South Australia Football League football game with discounts to permanent customers, join the campaign.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September - the day when this wholesale food supplier, alcohol and goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
Much has been put on the line since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are known as road users, so the market is more favourable to IGA drivers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in South Africa and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will consume 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first shops, taking out sales from all the players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA developers may lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, selling 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets respectively.
The loss of profits and the volume of food sales at a high level of constant cost to Metcash could cost companies about 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, he said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, Metcash food sales are expected to fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash " could disappear in a decade with high probability.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that Metcash's board member contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share declined from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and Metcash's income from food business, which is supplied by IGA, decreased by 43 per cent from 2012 as a result of the transactional verification and because of the pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to balance retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths by thousands of positions per week and helping IGA developers to redesign trading sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of company food products.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that price equations and remodeling of trading venues were gaining momentum, and hoped that the company would have an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanassi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be read, not criticized for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirius and deserves more than criticism, according to President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was reluctantly placed at the centre of attention because of the shameful burn of Kirius and Stan Vurrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match at Cincinnati, the judge had to pick up Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice, and Harrison said, "Vurrinka should have put it on Kirius' blades, and I have to put it on the shoulder of this guy."
Since the last time Kokkinakis was seen breaking a rocket after a wreck in his leg saved Richard Gaske from possible damage to the US Open, Hilly loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The boy is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in a single-level semi-final of Cup Davis against the British.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely the fact that the Tanas are involved in the conflict," Hilly said.
He really broke the rocket when he had his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the rocket when the hopes fell, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he had a very good handle on fairly provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very well, fits the team well, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's highly trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated in dignity.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, assuming "counsel" was the right solution for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to be back on the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on [Kyrós] disputes," Hilly said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, which is proved by people like Federer and Murray, he's growing up in front of the audience, he's allowed a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and detained those who tried to enter the country illegally to contain the flows of migrants flying in.
There were riots at the border, hundreds of migrants flocking to the border, and Serbian authorities reacted severely.
The people fleeing armed violence in their homeland had broken down tents and based themselves on the roadblocks between the two countries ' checkpoints.
However, frustration has increased.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special-purpose police.
Some in protest refused food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not the accompanying harm.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The waves at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to bear the overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, would be accepted in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year).
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria were asked on Tuesday to convene an emergency summit of the European Union next week to discuss the immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect rapid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, thus allowing them to block the roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Peter Siyarto said that his country was also planning to take a barbed wire off the border with Romania to bridge the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed its seizure at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in the urgent work of completing the banishment from the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “slow spot” and the border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees, victims of war in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most arrivals are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees who are victims of military actions that are eligible for protection, and this view differs sharply from that of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4m (13 ft) prison sentence from barbed wire built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and to include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking in persons.
“As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency”, the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac told journalists in the southern city of Seged.
We clearly understand that illegal crossing of borders is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been watching armed to the teeth of soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Djerj Bakondi, Orban ' s National Security Adviser, reported on the knowledge of the authorized authorities of 45 persons attempting to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the lock-up, are currently under police custody and are charged with administrative violations under new laws.
Authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, driving a railway wagon wrapped in a barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots erupted at the main entrance of the border near the town of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed office space for people to pass inside the metal container, and crowds pressured each other to break inside.
About 20 people were able to enter and thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would be denied food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in the national survey
Former Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to hold a twofold advantage in the race of Democrats for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (up from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary election rivalry, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have identified themselves with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than in support of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderate, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and Sanders and I are now equal.
However, Clinton still has great advantages among senior voters.
In the past month, Clinton was chasing Sanders for a two-digit number of liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were to become a candidate for the party.
Four would support her with some reservations and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trumpe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that now is the time of the female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about her association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called consent on issues and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although a third thinks he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, the primary democratic electors in most cases call Baden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of them said they'd choose Biden in the second, that's more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to issue her candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance of winning general elections; however, the figure declined from 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden has been heavily lagging in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that the most important thing in the candidate is that democratic voters choose other options than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates for democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key features among primary voters from their party.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Badden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Biden of all three runs honestly, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have an opinion on him.
The primary democratic electors also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baden to be similar.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of Sanders.
While questions concerning the personal mailbox of e-mail and the server of Hillary Clinton's household continue, the majority of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not affected their general opinion of her.
But it's a very different story for the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are unhappy with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was shared in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail has not affected their general view of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their view of her has deteriorated.
They're mainly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even if Clinton considers the voters to be honest and trustworthy from her party, this continues to be a problem for her of registered voters in general: only 32 per cent consider her to be fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be credible and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be credible and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good grades of leadership.
Of the six protested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best outcome in honesty.
Most people see an honest person in Sanders more than they don't, but as far as Carson is concerned, many people have no opinion of him.
The sampling error limit of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson drew close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came to Donald Trump in the last interview with CBS/New York Times.
The two candidates recruited half the voters in a new poll, leaving all the others behind in search of foot support.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump widely, whose support rate increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS poll held before the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups by squeezing Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Cassic, rolled back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, take third place together with 6 per cent.
The error limit for sampling of 376 Republican voters in this recent survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, which was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in surveys, showing support for 19 per cent of Republicans, with 32 per cent support for Trump.
The last interview of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's increased support last week, Trump made some critical incidents against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at the time the campaign was closed in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a college student named Baruch
Approximately two years after the death of a college student during the Dedication of Brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was brought against five people.
“The members of the P Delta Psi fraternity from Baruch New York College brutally attacked Chan Michael Deng during the celebration of September 2013 and failed to deliver him on time to the hospital, which led to his death”, police reported.
Officials say that a student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with a sand behind his back has been pushed several times while trying to achieve a goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for an hour before they took him to the hospital, they were talking to the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, find Google's symptoms and contact Andy Mengo, the National Brotherhood President, to ask the council, as the chief of police Chris Wagner told the press conference.
“At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng’s health,” said chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received several blunt head traumas, torsos and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity rituals, since at least one student dies during each year, beginning in 1970”, said Douglas Firerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family in his statement.
The brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jury of Monroe County was in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a novice and a criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that authorized all of this officially or informally, also hers”, Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will stumble, the yield of bonds will rise, and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the onset, and how long it will last.
In particular, history does not explain much about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for 86 months.
The ferocity of the Federal Reserve to raise rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The Administration of the United States Central Bank therefore strongly stresses that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates but on how much adaptation will take place.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the overall increase in rates is exaggerated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of the “price money” era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics expert at Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to be more normal, but still low will be the seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could respond, depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or so, waiting to raise rates can lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are not usually so dramatic.
“It does not seem that stock income will slow down 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve increase rates.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - to raise rates, remains fairly flat within 250 days (average growth 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, back to normal with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the Chief Action Strategy Specialist at Nuveen Asset Management published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities has a tendency not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate increase stage, and the income from stocks is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and can accelerate recession.
Mainly, the gross domestic product will be at almost the lowest point during the lifetime of the elevated rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the increase in the rate since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP of less than 4.5 per cent.
Even though he was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that this is a long time, with him holding only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a volatile economic background could be risky and asked whether it would be different this time, said Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the rates of the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with their views nailed to the Open Market Federal Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many policy makers and economists believe that FOMC could have approved the increase in the rate at this meeting, future trade is only 25 per cent likely.
“In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rising rates to date have been in the supercycle of an increasing financial instrument at GDP, covering peaks that precipitate recession, very quickly since the start of recovery”, the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and it has been 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for an increase in rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being done for stocks.
The principal difference is that bonds will have an effect faster than shares when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income appears to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the bond raising cycle, the bond yield is falling immediately," says Deutsche.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will result in long-term and short-term bond yields coming closer by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says Katie Jones, an analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and lowering inflation expectations, there are indications that the market has been geared towards a more stringent monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, income curves increased, credit lines increased, volatility increased - all market characteristics with stronger federal system policies.
Generally speaking, companies that run their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will find themselves in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"History shows that "quality" shares demonstrate performance above marketable within three months of initial increase in rates", analysts Goldman Sachs said in their client report.
Companies with a stable financial situation have lost their stable status as a result of each increase in the rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatility shares, also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average by 4 (per cent) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
High-percent floating-rate companies will lose most of their debt, Goldman said.
In addition to purely market transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Donors could also see profit through higher returns, although experts differed as quickly as possible.
"BBC Radio 3 - copy Classic FM" - approves Parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
Parliament member Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for “reduction of standards”
Proves that it is becoming increasingly different from the commercial competitor
Also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just sodrana with the British
The Parliamentary College of Damien Collins, which attacked The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of Parliament said, encouraging the television company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies do not do.
Parliamentary member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that the public radio is “stupid” and is increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems like I don't like using the word "simplification," but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, look like The British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that you first came to my mind, where you're really just copying what's already in the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the accusation, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning with Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and music creation is not really going to be like anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because British people were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to have been attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, the media and sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show the BBC purchased from the Dutch Talpa Media at an indicative price of £22 million.
You see why this program is often discussed in the absence of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feith and Boy George participated as judges, was made in the BBC "typical style".
He added what he wanted the Corporation to find a hit in its own home stable the next time it started an entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money for those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be the fault of that.
In the first three months of 2015 there was a 7 per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could have contributed to the deterrence of the roads
For about ten years virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that now there are signs of an online sales equation, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August showed a minimal increase since they began to be fixed in 2000, with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there are now signs of online sales balancing, after the latest data showed only a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rate in previous years and return back to the year 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation”, said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the sales index IMRG.
He explained that online sales were intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers made five times the average speed to the computers to make good use of their offers, thus destroying a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers actually fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little over £1 sterling out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as TV sets and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion shops on central streets.
Muslims bury the dead in the fall of a tap in Mecca, while Ben Laden's family is punished.
Muslims carry the bodies of the 29 dead on the streets as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized after a tap crash
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the destruction of the tap at Mecca’s main mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, the funerals occupied the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed through a sacred place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the lodger.
The bodies were handed out for burial, and the King of Saudi Arabia also fined up a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 passersby who died in the destruction of the tap at the Main Mosque carried on the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left an arrow on the tap that had been picked up in a broken tap.
The Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the breach.
The English news agency did not disclose this detail, but reported that the company leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the tap landing in the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to go to Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the destruction of the tap and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate harmonization with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Ben Laden family has been among the immediate governing families of Saudi Arabia and runs the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a changeling son whose family renounced it in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in their lives for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount is irreparable to the injured.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the availability of East European small-money workers
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
Number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the British put hammers and paints aside, and instead they hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or how to paint walls, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Because, according to B&Q, British people are increasingly hiring masters to perform hard work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home maintenance services, reported that at the same time, there was a significant flow of skilled workshops from Eastern Europe offering minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores that specialize in workshop goods, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store were taken by the representatives of the weak sex.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the latest demographic trends are not overlooked by the increasing number of single women households that are more active in housing than in the past.
Mrs. Lori said, "In our stores, men still work mostly.
Steps should be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on acquired goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers by achieving equal numbers of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and Finance.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took up the costs of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in half a year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time for decision at the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is observing a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses a crucial decision within two days - raising or not the interest rate for the first time in the past decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believed that it would make more time and maintain the current rate of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced its rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero note to normalization of interest rates," said Angel Murdere, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and the inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but it was all about their confidence that there was a chance against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" -- hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Wanger border.
On Tuesday, Budapest closed the border for settlers.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to penetrate other routes to the European Union.
One of them is across the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some figures, buses taking refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanović assures that his country is doing its best to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to treat them humanely.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to decide, and no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and more so in a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests that Budapest open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is unwavering:
If anyone calls a refugee, he has to fill out the documents necessary in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already set up a 175-thicken-metre border with Serbia.
But Orban has no intention of stopping it: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis had been a member of the right-wing governments for several years, which, according to the left-hand side, had led the country to a financial crisis.
He now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, has challenged Cyprus.
He met with Euronews journalist a few days before the elections.
Eunice: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving way to SIRISA coalitions, but now, according to interviews, New Democracy compared it to popularism.
What changed during this time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a surplus of its budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus banished them.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Daily life was worse than January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens concerned.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme for which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with the agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that the country's withdrawal from the EU would have.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, and we have solidarity funds, Junker's package and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures have been the result of Mr. Cyprus negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government is seeking order within the first year, is acting rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession may again be negotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to renegotiate with our creditors because they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU funding and greater investment opportunities that we must open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, as we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Cyprus had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Junker, Holland, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I explain to them that by the end of 2014, we had tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners.
We have moved on to reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At the time, I was the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that formed the government majority at the time.
Despite their serious ideological differences under key bills, we had a working parliament, which is in the presence of populists and extremists and mass demonstrations outside.
And we have succeeded in bringing the country into a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks there has been a massive influx of refugees in Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries in which these people are seeking?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb we have to deal with after the election.
The reason is that the SIRISA Government did not act as it should.
In such matters, there should be an advance, because if the problem comes upon you, only emergency measures remain.
And that's the situation we're in.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS had only done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus had done in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which is being supported by the President of the Republic, who has called for the EU summit, will enable a solution to be found.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that took place with them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension in this issue, and we will hold the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you.
In the peace town of Drykowka Donetské region, criminal investigation officers of the Police Department, together with military counter-intelligence, established and detained a suspect who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoi Rog (Dnepropetrova district), who fired from his machine the night before during the joint use of alcohol, and the conflict in the village of Vihrnetorec, Yasinovatské district of Donetskina fired an assault rifle at his opponent.

A man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “sorrying” about the first murder and wished to “turn everything back”, the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in Gothier, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta had called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that doesn't touch anyone, but probably upset.
The police asked about the caller's name, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found Amy Prentiss's body there, 41, and a note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I wish I could bring it all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
The Rector of William Laforge University reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind”.
Despite Monday's information that Lamb was referring to a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
About Prentiss responding as "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss have a daughter who's 19 and she's "scarred."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the newspaper San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from home on the Internet.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lighting, and that she had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The night the police caught him on Route 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university site, in spring 2015 Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy at the University of Delta.
Stars that have lost their luck
Actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his many-year-old life partner, Farra Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug addiction and was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United broke out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV in Angelhaven.
While the defender is experiencing this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless subcommission for the 15th minute that 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated.
It's terrible--a young man came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, got through a lot of trouble and started playing fantastic, and this is where it happened.
It had an oxygen mask on it in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he had not received a red card and no penalty was given.
The arbitrator, Nikola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged armpit.
In his tweet, Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even stronger than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is having an accident with Luke Shaw when it comes to playing with PSV
An English defender will have an additional incentive to correct the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said, "It's a very severe trauma."
When any player gets hurt like that, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to harm our opponent.
Moreno moved his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gaul at the Peace Championship in 2014.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very severe injury, you're not feeling well," Koku said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball flying in another direction, so it looked like he touched it, but I didn't see the horseshoe under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after the clash with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Loraks?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll take a while before you know it almost by heart.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question by a representative of a family holiday company about his favorite childhood book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a story with an environmental bias written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This funny, moving, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
In addition to the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to refer to the contents of the book, it does well, but it does tell the story of the one-name film that was taken in 2012, with the new characters and details added to describe the rather short original narrative.
“In the surrounded high walls of the city of Osmugville, where there was no green and even no air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream, by fulfilling her wish to see the present tree,” we read in a text a description of the love story of the unknown Dr. Suze (the name of Theodore Suse Hazel), who died in 1991.
If that seems unsuspecting, Cameron's text is read almost like a short story of the Lorax film, published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounded high walls of the town of Wymugville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a widely recognized active parent, is so ignorant of the contents of a book in which an untitled boy learns how to destroy the environment by a greedy tree-cutter and the “many man” Findkins, despite the Loraks protests (the name of which is given in the title of the book) is a ridiculous creature with a smile that “speaks on behalf of the trees”.
It is likely that such a difficult PR task was entrusted to the performer, who has never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had reportedly been received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron headquarters, but further comments were not followed.
For Adam Litt, there was obviously a risk of getting into congregation England, but that's still a complicated question.
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the rally England has selected for this tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series with the last time it happened does not seem likely.
I wouldn't rule out victory on my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players who are virtually taking the ball and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012 but only a youth's positive.
With Moen Ali's ball, he turns into a boulevard, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown test-level figure, is an attack option.
More on the subject: Adam Litt left England for a test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his head coach in Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, but the obvious but brutal reality was that cricket players were judged by judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've already said that before) players choose their own.
A couple of half a cents, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he picks up more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another possibility.
The head coach of congregation England, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression is a complex question.
Lit played seven games, same as Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trotter for the Caribbean Premier League, when Litt was in the best shape, but that lost opportunity was in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a Batman, whom I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, as we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was something.
He must at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will certainly depend on the team's composition in the OAU.
The thought of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would allow us to insert an extra backer, keeping four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a bat can't hit a ball in there, and this lion has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not quite be what it takes for his County Woostershire, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches with the third Batman, before going out as an opening in 2001.
He won at once three hundred and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a backup spinner, and in my brief conversation with him, he has proved to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- on average 31 with a bit and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among the backers who vote for a little bit, and the selectors choose youth.
He's going to learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the assembly, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training composition.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys in the game who'll bring her the richest experience she's ever had under all the conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood will be included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and spare pace in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether a game or coaching job, and, like Mahela, he has great intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said before, can give new forces to the team.
Colley's team, Darem Ben Stokes, is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break for Australia, and for example, I do not have any problems.
While not all agree, the trainers and the selectors do not define the schedule.
And you have to remember how players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The camp of supporters of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's reckless policy to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without considering the selection of the genius Jeremy- "This is yes or no?"- Corbin as a leader of the Labour or the depravity of the TCC about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners too have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A fellow European diplomat explained on the day that, in the situation in which the EU is currently facing various crises - not all of them of its own making - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda for sowing concessions and disruptive arrangements of changes they do not generally want.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it the selfie program Dave and George.
The prime minister and the minister of finance travel at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against the backdrop of a well-known local monument, at or without local celebrities, then coming home and saying that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to keep Britain in external contact with the European Union - "Don't leave us together with France", says Berlin - suggests that the elderly ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they do not care, we will stay or we will leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as she has worsened herself for those in her seat Thetcher (11), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, François Alland, stands before the reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon obtain a nationalist right-wing government, Spain left-wing.
It is hard to see them coming out of the skins of the skins to help selfies, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving Britain - which they do not want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to hand out deliberately useless SNP-style belts during the referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to drive Britain out of the EU, my friend assumes.
"Revision was a fix idea," and "British received nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptically the media magnates are towards the EU, unlike the time of the referendum launched by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may be sad to remember Boris Johnson, an entrenched Euro-opportunist who celebrated his 'direct EU bananas' by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite all his bullshit, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a sharp company made up of fearsome tax collectors, phone hackers and pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt the same way about them, but he was aware that when you were in a cell with a big gorilla, you had to give her the bananas to distract her and not let her eat you at lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was a more aloof to Blair than Blair himself in the face of Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair had followed the principles in favour of the abolished EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who had given him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendlyly slapped me on my back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he doesn't have time to waste on me anymore -- seems to be at risk of repeating Neil Kinnok's 'Boykot Murdoch' strategy from the '80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press, not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, whose couch he was sitting on at the Air Force on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin for Europe is what I call evolutionaryly.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
In fact, most people outside the traditional Ukip trend and the wider “partners of small England” among them may say yes.
It's the same thing that Hillary Benn, but not Bennith, told Benn on the radio and TV this week, and his inner boy scout refused to admit that the appointment of Korbin-bearing John McDonnell as the "tenev" minister of finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-old man fought hard on TV for his disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour Office, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “under all circumstances” is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to Parram and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
For the sake of not telling the Democrat and his boyfriend Corbin -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of the messages remains important in the century of 24-hour television seven days a week, especially in the watershed of social networks, paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to give Cameron just so far away from Europe, allowing him to accept as well as support from Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main error over EU membership, within the “bennithic” economy of the entrenched fortress, is no longer an issue of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for whom narcissism, caused by a slight difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his delusions about NATO-Tom Watson, it is unwavering that J.K. will not advocate leaving, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their heads at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on Britain's concessions when it might be pointless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of Turkey is cutting costs, as I was reminded Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influenza Security.
Experts Criticise the Review of Electronic Cigarettes by Public Health England
Statements by the Government of the Agency that 95 per cent less than smoking is harmful to electronic cigarettes were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) jointly with Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report -- the “reversive milestone” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence”.
Some researchers, however, questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and tobacco industry.
In the editorial paper in the medical journal Lancet last month, “extremely hard proof” was criticized, on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “hard or narrow grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects that PHE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking” is based on detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotino-retaining products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the producer of electronic cigarettes, not to mention the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of board members, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claimed funding for the publication industry.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco route to PHE.
A scientific article published by the group “excellently agrees” that there is a lack of “high evidence of the harmful effects of most products by most criteria”, McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell explained that the PHE statements that “to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a road leading children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare in PHE, explained that the BMJ statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his passion all his life.
All evidence suggests that health threats to electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what it proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die of smoking - related diseases, while NHS costs £2 billion a year.
Clearly, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking - we do our tasks before the nation.
Former Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for successful shows like the soap opera on Albert's Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to create programs that are not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public broadcasts that probably only see a small part of the audience, the peak time when competitors have a high rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation wished to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had been unsuccessfully trying to cooperate with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast broadcasts that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies,” said Johnson to members of the House of Lords Communications Committee in order to determine the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider to be a good solution in the medium and long term, companies should leave only those programmes that are not issued and are not intended to be issued by other companies.
The Voice shows are on the air in the Prime Slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give up a lot for her.
I don't understand how that could be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would demean the BBC.
A serial entrepreneur, Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing “out of ambitions and because of their belief that it was the best way to secure long-term support”.
His comments on the BBC's most popular BBC show echoed the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Boll, who, in his lecture on McTaggart's memory in Edinburgh in 2003, invited the BBC to sell East Enders.
Johnson noted that the more niche transfers of the BBC of a public nature “continue to go to BBC4, where there is often no appreciation of the audience, but the company’s function has been accomplished, and this can be argued as an argument in the janjan sermons justifying the income of £4 billion: “Well, of course, we are doing all these incomprehensible transfers that no one is watching.”
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the Johnson license fee, he told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people whose 150 pounds are big money, I'm interested, they think because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of the BBC material currently produced was formally classified as educational - he said that it was 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto “information, education and entertainment”.
On the subject of the Elstein partnership, he noted that the BBC should make more efforts in such areas as Change concerts (some of them were said to be on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Sonogenetics allows control of brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the raccoons change direction at a time when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have extracted worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
The tiny raccoons change direction at a time when they are affected by sound pulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulse effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers control brain activity by light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called “sanogenetics”, the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solka Institute, La Hoia, California, told the Guardian that this method could once be replaced by a deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that they were beginning to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles increase the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worm’s system.
Increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 “ion channels” found in the membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and trigger the cells associated with them, reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create the nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in “optogenetics” - a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light impulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that comes to the right part of the brain along the optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves are unhindered through the body’s tissues, so it is not necessary to go inside the skull box.
“We believe that the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can make human neurons vulnerable to ultrasonic signals in time to treat certain neurological diseases under clinical conditions,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising is being bullied by the British arms trade
See the Amnesty International video with a protest against the display of arms.
Amazing killer drones!
Ruining naked iron candals!
The cluster bombs!
Electric light-forest sockets that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
Audacious voice and cartoons leave no doubt that this advert is the largest international arms exhibition, a parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to “touch” weapons with repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems at the ExCeL centre in Dokland.
Topic: DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian regimes are going to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of a number of posters on bus stops and on subway trains that require another look at them.
"An important announcement by the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written in one of them in the letters of the London Metro, depicting the DLR line, which turns into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on the DLR line. Passengers are requested to help prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Hard Design Museum in Banksy Dysmaland Park.
A team called "Special Patrol" helped to spread them around London using a "prescription array", a 6-pound set of wrenches, which is said to "access about a third of the advertising space on the world's bus stops".
London's transporters were not pleased with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Unit.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and the teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the display of arms welcoming passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty was screened over 100,000 times over 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, working for bono, with graphic designer and sound artist, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition - with a pass in ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "to fill her house with bright colors and animation has proved to be a more exciting profession."
"They've incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action and guarantee that this liquefied equipment will not be sold illegally at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms exhibition goes from ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In the Saab press release, she leaked information on the "AT4CS RS for a shoulder shooting" order issued by the U.S. Army.
It includes “a cumulative warhead with no analogues that brings unrivalled prohibited action within the target”.
No matter what he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory like a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tight smiles of those I annoyed - and many long complaints about others.
What I learned is basically eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can vary from a little nervous to absolutely frightening.
He encourages you to talk, tell people where you're from, if you've been on academic leave, and where you've spent it, if you're supporting Corbin, and why you're "honestly, not loving, not hating Marmaith," because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I'm gonna be at my place."
Take a break.
And help others to relax too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people that you like, not people you don't even talk to, even if you've got fire extinguishers on fire.
Let's give the people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking places, midnight cinemas, and general showers, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
More on the subject: Don’t even think about starting university education when you’re in a relationship
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a place of refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of dress from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy that I spent with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of socializing, not knocking on him, but texting him.
By the way, knock, do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're beginning your university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-off show, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and carrying a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange act, not so much like the 1950s with them, "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked something for you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to get to know each other.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably associate with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Badly blinded comas of torture, sugar and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, a chicken is stolen, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Get yourself a milkman.
It is likely that he will invite you not to be shy, even if it boils inwardly from rage.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to be more mature than my neighbor, who was pouring liquid into her milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noises that prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the people talking about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to remove the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since she had three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut off her music and locked the door behind her, going to the three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary before you bite the elbows, if you would accept a neighbor as your future spouse, get involved in them, break up their relationship, and be able to see him every day, and maybe watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you won't tell your heart, but if the hot neighbor isn't exactly your future spouse, try to cool off your own dust a little bit.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the game and the grass is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns into the opposite in seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting lesson on safety by hiding something, but never pack anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the door and put the keys in the glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer, but don't glue other people's things with Blu-Tack more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings app and selecting the General and then the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after the installation when an error message appears telling them that "Renovation of the app has not been possible".
In order to avoid this, users are advised to wait either until recovery has ceased or to try to update via iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimised the probability of this action by reducing the amount of updates, and also simplified implementation with a special utility that proposes removing the apps and reinstalling them after the process has been completed.
It is worth making sure that your phone is loaded or is close to the charger when it is updated to prevent discharge of the battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, as the discharge of the phone in the process may result in an update failure.

In iOS 9, new functions are now included, including improved personal assistants, and innovations that increase the performance of the iPad, as well as adjustments that increase the speed of work and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow has provided to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
PJ Media reported on this.
“The Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the continued support of President Assad on the part of Russia poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of combating extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power”, said the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the United States “will welcome the constructive role of Russia in trying to confront the “Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
Moreover, White House Spokesperson Josh Ernest noted that the time for telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come up: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the phone and try to make this call."
Barak Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime by “the winning rate”.
I remember talking to Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support from Assad would only make things worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," the President of the United States said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
Mine-development intends to release temporarily imported yachts and other floating funds for rest and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free importation were prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the Republic of the Republic of Croatia.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported on this.
In June 2015, RF Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev commissioned a number of departments - Mine Economic Development, Mintrans RF, Minkultura, MID, MCS, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for sailing in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million go to the execution of European States annually for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The economic development of Russia has prepared a draft decision by the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the modification of the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes, providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sports.
In the view of the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of the country's coastal areas, said Lashkin.
This issue was brought before the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariffs, Non-tariff Regulations, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and was also approved by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of Mineconomy, the proposed measure of full conditional release on importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the subcommission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation, Mineconomy will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with EEA member States, Lashkin explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate external economic activity and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc., services (personal computers, typewriters), measuring instruments, storm equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious observances.
In the Mintrans press service, the RF “Investims” reported that they had issued mandatory regulations on the port of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the operation and exit of small, sporty sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
Mintrans has been entrusted to the Crimea seaport captains to ensure the simplified operation of small, sporty sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport and the departure of the vessels listed from the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the RF on the approval of the seaport boundaries of the Crimea Seaports.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, the orders had already been adopted, the others were in the process of being negotiated, and noted in the press service of the agency.
In the view of Mintrans, the host, classification and inspection, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out State registration for small vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, it was because of poorly developed infrastructure that was extremely difficult to sail.
Looking in southern Italy and France, it is an ever-growing industry that employs a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coastline is a small area of interest, the only piece where yachts can be exploited year after year, is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Helandzhika, Novorossiya, Anapa district.
But the big challenge is that in the area, very strict border-service rules are that if you want to go out for a walk, you have to form a lot of permits.
Also, inside Russia, you were going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem arises where to take it, says Nordmarine Sales Director Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 metres in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts has declined.
The World Bank granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for financial sector development.
This was reported by the International Organization ' s press service.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures for banking sector reforms in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimiao Fan, said that bank sector reforms would help restore real-economy credit and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy, and the World Bank observed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fann calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government had previously approved the granting of a loan to Ukraine of €100 million, and referred to RIA Novosti.
In prisons, separate blocks are requested for transgenders.
The Federal Corrections Service (FSIN) Public Council for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons in October 2015 discuss among other issues the possibility of establishing individual blocs for transgenders and transgenders in colonies.
A councilman named Vladislav Grib spoke about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-polar convicted prisoners in Russia, separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many) could be provided for a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only possible to determine whether the punishment of citizens to such isolated places will be carried out after convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations to prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice was successful abroad: there were separate transgender cells in the SIDS (where the accused were prior to the court ' s decision) and special units in the correctional facilities.
Today, it is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in conventional cells is dangerous to them, they are suffering for their families and the sea problems for FIN staff.
The humiliation of the trances by roommates is guaranteed,” says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of criminals with an uncertain sex, we must also expect to be distributed.
SIZO is definitely not needed - just cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
According to Grib, there may be 50 or 100 people in the bloc, and if a specialized corps is established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are detained at the crime scene of SISO, and therefore the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, and the introduction of such practices for those already convicted in a separate colony is yes, says Grib.
Remember, before that, law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which detention facility, male or female, the 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kojukov (known as Alina Davis), which is why a man with a virgin background was not arrested.
He was released under the signature of non-departure at home.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as there is no transgender mechanism in the SIDS and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places for punishment by transgenders, noting that it is also possible abroad to identify people in colonies, male or female, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, just like the issue of providing security in gay prisons, says Alexeiv.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done for this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more than transgenders in prisons.
Alexeiev also doubted that in Russia, there would be many citizens willing to pretend to be transcescuals in order to become different from the normal colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a colony for transgenders, but not always clearly.
For example, in the U.S., one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change the sex, said Alexeiev.
A person may feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender punishment, I doubt the prison staff will be serious about the safety of such people and the subtlety of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in RF Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in the colony could severely delay the commencement of punishment for convicted persons.
A commission is being set up, it is a question of sexology, and psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, and it is not one test based on which a high-priced conclusion is made.
Today’s mental - health facilities allow this to happen.
Therefore, even before changing sex, potential patients are always undergoing such experiments -- they are precisely showing whether switching sex with surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system could be implemented against convicted persons, since on average, the survey takes a month.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of establishing separate transgender blocs, also doubts that it would be appropriate under the current economic conditions to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgenders in Russia.
It's hard to count, there's no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it's possible to say that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such deviations and yet commit crimes are only a small number, said Lordkipanidze.
Now, at the request of the administration, homosexuals, transgenders can obtain certain conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the world junior chess championship.
In Hunti-Mansiysk, the world chess champion of the juniors ended up in his 20s.
The end of the primacy seemed more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was able to drive the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Dudu, who seemed confident to go to the title.
A Ukrainian chess player named Natalie Bux was the winner.
The world chess champion, who had been in Hunta Mansiysk since early September, seemed to have lost almost all of his intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan Kschishtof Duda, who had won a series of four victories (the rivalries were taking place on the Swiss system in 13 tours), had confidently taken the lead.
Given that Duda was a first-rate favorite, and was considered one of the most promising young chess players in the world, the likelihood that he would miss the break-in seemed very small.
And even when Duda cut the speeds and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut back to 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the title fight.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help. Win your Doud a party.
Plus, this commitment to victory could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Happily, Michael Antipov avoided them.
He safely dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he had to wait for his party to be completed by Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, a Polish chess player took the Dutch out.
So Antipov and Duda had the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the management of the Hunta-Mansi Autonomous District, the Governor of Natalia Komarov, traditionally paid great attention to the development of chess in the region, gave him a major prize.
And in the competitions of girls, the intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament, Natalie Buxe (Ukraine), was enough not to lose in the last round to succeed.
Thus, the victory of the Russian woman Alina Bivol prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second to the 0.5 ball championship.
Wympelek changes the regional structure.
The company unites Primorzsky and Ural regions in one major Volzsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East in the region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As pointed out by Mihail Slobodin, the vice-president of Wimpekoma, the changes are being made to “be a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In his interview with Russian 24 television channel, Mr. Slobodan explained that they intend to reduce “ten percent” of staff in Russia.
The supervisor checked 78 Moscow-based burger king snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant on Volkolam Road was fined 50,000 rubles, and a restaurant on Big Tulske Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were resolved.
43 diners violated the requirements of the premises.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitary and sanitary maintenance of premises, non-compliance with ventilation devices, a bacterium of the gut stick was found in some institutions.
The franchise on the Burger King brand is owned by the UOO "Burger Rus" owner of the Alexander Kolobova's Chocolate Network, 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the department against the indexing of 10% of freight tariffs and the provision of gossidiums, as requested by OAS RZD.
First they wanted 17% of the indexation, now they want 10%, and then they want multibillion dollars of budget subsidies, he says.
We're saying: it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save money, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “more stringent” proposals, which are currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of carrying out a $300 million stock trip option, a gold-digging company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to supplement Sumeru to $80 million (the difference between Sumeru stock price and market quotations) which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until 3 October to implement the option or to demand benefits.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal Project "Kisil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Ministry of Housing Policy Department, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of builders.
“We understand that this is not going to happen, so we are developing a mechanism,” the official said.
"Citizen Kane" screenplays at the fair.
The representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported plans to launch the draft version of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered to be one of the best works of director, screenwriter and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Calabas on 29 September and will present three black scenarios, the estimated cost of each of them is $20 to 30,000, according to AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankewicz, is the earliest scenario in private collections? and is entitled “American” - that was the working name of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Minprom trade: targeted food aid will not be an analogue of the USSR cards.
Russian Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Evtukhov reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be a analogue of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These are modern targeted food aid for the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the combination of "food card."
I would particularly like to point out that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the total deficit over time, the distribution card system where the number of products received is normal.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," is what Mr. Evtukhov's TASS puts forward.
Previously, "U" wrote that the programme for introducing food cards for the poor had been introduced into the Government.
For more details on the Minpromtorga initiative, see "U" "Igor Shuvalov commissioned the preparation of food cards".

The trial of justice of justice of the 100 world judge will begin on 16 September.

The court confirmed that there was a claim for divorce in proceedings, noting that the claim for division of property had not been filed and would be brought before a district court.
RJD President Alexander Bobreshov resigns.
OAS Vice-President "Russian Railways" (RJD) for Corporate Security Alexander Bobreshov leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, President of the Board of Directors of RZD Arkady Dvorkovic, said that the issue of withdrawal from RZD by Alexander Bobreshov had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Vice Prime Minister, the staffing changes in the RZD management are not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, "U" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin OAS RZD, the first Deputy Transporter Oleg Belozer, who ran the financial unit, led the transport.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in monopolies: a new freight tariff system would be established in one and a half years.
For more details on the transformation into a company, see the "U" material "RJD rewrites the securities".
This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers of Top-1000 Russian Managers is the 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study highlights the work of Russian managers for a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The candidates' initial pool consists of the winners of the rating last year.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the rating of the current year and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies that would be useful to add candidates to the overall pool.
It is possible to appoint the following managers of the company's functional areas: Financial Director, Business Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Government Relations, Director of Corporate Management.
Each proposed expert is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to issue a management team to up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of industry candidates is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry industries, machinery, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with a login and password for entering www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and may make their assessments on the criteria proposed for each function.
The rating methodology is based on the principle “The best select the best”: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows for the best possible assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final outcome of the rating shall be approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The regular meetings of the expert commissions are attended by all the candidates for the current year and the multiple candidates for the rating of the past years.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of senior managements and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of function.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places remain strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian and the rules of "U".
At the time of publication the ratings could be changed in the status of managers and companies.
The comfort rate for the investment is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April was 40 per cent.
What do you think the situation is today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014- early 2015, the credit levels of ISB have decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Credits of between 25 and 30 per cent of the year-olds were of no benefit to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to place all its potential problems at a higher rate in the future, from delays to non-returns, it is now impossible to do so: rates are both cloudy.
For business, the current level of MSB credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their purchasing capacity.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How much do you think entrepreneurs' demand for credit is being met?
Following the decline in the interest rate CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to seek credit much less.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for development and future revenues.
Today, the business has one solution: work needs to be learned, focusing on the economic situation today in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of funds.
At the same time, when financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All of this ultimately enables companies to make the product more competitive and keep the business even in a fragile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the lending market of the IRB and will have an impact on its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will depend largely on the central bank policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for the IAS is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when CB rates are reduced.
Traditionally, small and medium-sized businesses, which are limited in both cash replenishment and economic behaviour adjustment options, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, delicate, and at the same time quite complicated for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as is any other model of brand: without curvature attractive outside, technically accomplished inside.
Japanese, by its “Japanese” itself, is able to bring the product of the Land of the Sun to its full delight.
As much as you can argue in favour of cars from other countries, even in principle you will agree to these arguments, but the whole conversation will be scattered from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably not only love technology, but also all the rest of them Japanese.
Quoting Bass with the move, preparing the food of the vasabi, collecting the katans and dressing your girlfriend - no, not the kimono, of course, but the canons of the street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school form is the only form girls wear with pleasure and after school.
It has amazing properties, both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the CX-5 is a five-horizontal-line radiator grid.
But where the shape of the car changes more strongly, a new drawing of the headlamps and the rear lamps that make the car instantly known in the car’s flow.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
Siluet is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the outside has a hard-on.
You don't have to call the police.
The CX-5, one of the safest in the world, can only experience stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The diesel engine of 2.2 litres provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litres- only 5.9 litres. The power generator shall be assembled exclusively by automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose the Legins with the print from the Not Cross police tape.
In addition, Mazda has made every effort to keep you out of CX-5 driving your own traffic.
To further enhance comfort, while maintaining excellent management, the suspension has been redesigned by front and rear shock absorbers and optimized the form of front lower lever plugs.
Full drive system adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise level of the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
The bather is as bored as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl's in a bathrobe with an original picture.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role warrior.
She'll get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved construction of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space both for broad shoulders and for long legs - who has what.
The long legs will no doubt appreciate that the crotch in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and do not beat at the ankles in the expressions.
The widest range of active safety systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
Radar, lasers, and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There is also adaptive lighting, and warning of derailment, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A comfortable, minimally speaking, loads of 561 litres. The rear seats consist of a ratio of 4:4 each section is equipped with a separate bearing lever, and increases the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The costume of a cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurums."
It looks particularly like pyjamas.
You can do anything in it!
Of course you're going to sleep.
But it's also fun for the little kids.
Or just walk around in the street like that...
After all, it's so great when there's a chance to choose -- nice clothes, manners, or cars.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the Kawaicat store material.
Kiev broke the atomic unit.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the construction of the Hmelnické és.
On Wednesday, however, the Supreme Council voted in favour of the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the third and fourth clusters were signed in 2010-2012 but could not be implemented.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law expiring the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the FF on the construction of the third and fourth bloc at the Hmelnické és.
The draft law introduced by the Government was only possible with a second vote, and it was supported for the first time by 210 deputies, with a minimum of 226 members necessary, but then by 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The Hmelnička ERA of the original project was to have four 1 GWT power blocks with VVR-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on the extension led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there was no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was anticipated that the construction of the blocs would have to be credited to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and following the cooling of the two countries, Kiev began to reverse relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry by refusing to cooperate on the Hmelnica Nuclear Power Plant and on the construction project in Ukraine.
The only area where relations persisted was the purchase of fuel to the FF for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (providing about half of the country's electricity generation), as the Ukrainian NEC "Energot" had replaced Russian supplies with something.
The plans for the construction of the Hmelnické ÁS with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: in Kiev as early as 2014, negotiations with Czech Skoda JS were announced.
UNgensek opposes the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“No military solution”, the AP answers the question of Syria's military support by Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also said that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the United Nations Security Council members on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the United Nations BSC countries later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Gensthab of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that Gensthab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a military base in Syria in the future.
There's no such plan yet.
"But all may be," said Mr. Bogdanowski.
Previously, U reported that the United States did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the FF.
For more details on the US's doubts about Syria's Russian assistance, see the material "U" "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington".
In the OSCE PA, a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia is reported.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian Parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
“What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, the TASS adds Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and “to return to the normal life of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the “Normandi format”, or in the form of a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, according to policy, Kiev is supported by any kind of dialogue.
Formerly the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, Leonid Kuchma, the expert president of the country, said that the self-proclaimed Donetskya and Lugansk republics had in principle not changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Election Commission of Lower Novgorod presented the outcome of the elections to the Municipal Duma, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of irregularities during the elections were made by representatives of the CRC, who accused the election of “covering forgeries”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
Along with the election, the Communist Party of Russia refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the construction of multi-family houses.
The city's election officially presented the results of the election to the proud Lower Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million were included in the voter lists in Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were issued to the polling boards and 268,000 were voted in the election.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their votes.
On the lists of "One Russia" six seats are proud of Dmitri Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnovov, Vasili Shuprenov, Elizavete Solonchenko, Vjeceslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorno.
The LDDR's only mandate was given to Vladimir Zyrinovski, party leader.
The two mandates of the CRC are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the Member of the State, Alexander Tarnavy.
The three mandates of Justice Russia are given to Alexander Razumovski, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates should determine whether they would be working as MPs in the City Duma: if they refused the mandate, they would move on to the next partner candidate.
The Chairman of the High Commissioner, Alexander Maceev, informed the Commission that he was on duty to send telegrams to Zyrinovski and others for waiver of mandates.
In approving the election record, the representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the garrison, with the right of deliberation from the CRC, Leonid Krasnocutsky proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No.21-24, recalling that, under the order of the head of the administration of the Sormö district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located.
Within a long time, neither the members of the Gós smoke nor the candidates themselves nor the observers themselves could go through, and the resonance scandal with the doors of the Rally was shown on television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberation were able to attend.
The chapter only ceased their access when the vote ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
“Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present”, paralysed a member of the mountains by the electorate Natalie Andrewshin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building the administration had been illegally detained for more than four hours by a member of the council of Ludmila Aristou, for which there was a statement sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also resented that, on election day, the UICs began sealing the urns at 6-7 a.m. by placing ballots on them for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the commissions with the right of deliberation and observer were not informed, so they arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the polling stations were opened, ballots could be dropped uncontrollably.
However, by choosing mountains, which had already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, Alexander Makeev said that no violations of the discards of unaccounted ballots had been found.
The members of the Commission and their colleague’s proposal from the “Justice of Russia” Maria Popova were not supported by the proposal to step out with the amendment of regional legislation in order to clearly determine the time of opening of the ballots with the ballots of the ballots, which would then fall into the urn.
"At least go to CEC on your own initiative," Mrs. Popova Alexander Maceev said.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRCF, Sergey Samohin, was attacked by the President with strong accusations, shouting that he was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering the electoral falsifications.
"You're not here at the rally, so be careful!" was offended by the president of the election.
As a result, the Protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the election should adopt the general results of the elections, followed by the first meeting of the City Duma of Lower Novgorod of the Sixth Convent within three weeks.
In addition to defining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission rejected the Russian Communists political party ' s registration of the local referendum initiative group.
According to the documents, the parties were about to raise two issues for the discussion of the lower townships: whether they agreed that the fee for the installation of multi-family houses should be “immediately abolished” and that the rates for housing and utility services should be “freeze up to 2020”.
However, Duma lawyer Irin Maslov explained that the treatment of Russian Communists was contrary to legislation.
FedEx is mixed in nature, reducing forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported the inconsolable results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the drop in demand for freight services and the increase in costs in its ground transportation unit.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, last year, FedEx reported hiring 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares adjusted by about 2.5 per cent at pre-trades 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts estimate $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast declines despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in land charges for heavy or safe goods, which will begin in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase its profits over the past year by reducing expenditure, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “worked stablely in view of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The employment plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competing UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, approximately as much as they did last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the year before.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share forecast by Zacks Investment Research surveying 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks amounted to $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, boom purchases on the Internet dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained overall unchanged due to increased costs of large establishments and self-insurance.
Express transport units received higher income due to higher base rates, while revenue fell in the freight sector due to higher labour costs.
At pre-trades, about an hour before the FedEx stock market opened, it dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduran Red Tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a richly decorated two-floor meeting room will be painted by the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a steady growth in the economy, recent shocks in global financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate for federal funds, even by only a fourth percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of the broker’s company, Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rate that has increased uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait longer," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself provokes financial market fluctuations.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to hold back from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Jones index rose to 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the people who define the Federal System's strategy would leave the rate this week, said John Lonsky, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It will be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve is to do so, “they will have to go a long way in adopting their strategy to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic.”
Other experts objected that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty as to how the federal system would operate.
A month ago, the Federal System seemed to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small trick in slow financial tightening, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite Liberian complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs were slowing in August, the labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in over seven years and almost at a level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the 2 per cent annual target of the central bank, the Federal System management stated that the temporal effect of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key factor.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the shrinking labour market”, noted Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month after China devaluationed its currency.
The Dow-Jones average index for industrial companies fell to 16 per cent of its record value in May, as investors feared that slowdown in the Chinese economy could impede global growth.
The market has partially recovered its positions this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10 per cent lower than the May value.
In the context of the Federal Reserve, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate increase period.
“In the absence of any information about what happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would have turned the hooks in this meeting”, said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Officer of the Federal Reserve System.
They are now expected to wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty as to what the implications for the American economy might be, and they have little reliable data after the recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account when making those decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become the world financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Only one suggestion from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mouse" its monetary expansion caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science”, noted Zachary Carabell, the head of the Envesnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System there have been excessive reactions to financial market movements which seem to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified impact on growth in the United States,” said Laker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System overturned those cuts.
The federal reserve system should be the first to care for stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last panic and nearness of the level, he said.
“Of course, you would not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of rising rates because markets are experiencing shocks,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and as long as it does not change, I do not think that they should be ahead of the events.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/store is open in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is an optish Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
Market / warehouse - a store where you can buy everything immediately offering a round-the-clock choice of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, cuisine, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to search all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The culinary department in the store (good and low-cost) is located not far from the cash register and offers various options for export.
What's the suggestion: do you need anything Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include delicate Asian and local Thai grass, fruit and much more.
The meat tray is as varied as the fish’s staff will clean up and divide the fish and even roast it for you if you want.
An excellent part of the store is placed under an impressive ice-cream department where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, leeches, fish, beef blood and gall, pigs, eggs, local sausage, semi-prefabricates and much more.
Who buys: Owners and chefs of restaurants and families and individual buyers.
In the broad passage there are also shopping carts and fork trucks.
Finding: Fresh noodle montong near the exit.
Where it is: The shop is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the district of Chinatown and the business center of the city, in several blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
The Speaker of the State, Sergei Narishkin, allows the United States to deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees flow to Europe.
According to Interfax, he presented this view to journalists in Ulanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is asked: Is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?” he asked.
"Someone probably suspected and knew that the flows of refugees, those unfortunate and disadvantaged people who escape death, are seeking the well-being of the EU countries," he added.
Narishkin asked: "Have many European political leaders been frank about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally pervading their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to keep quiet," he noted.
In the view of Narishkin, NATO has opposed many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe has, unfortunately, long and impartially looked and looked at how NATO-compliant military bootstraps spread and moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law,” said the speaker.
Government troops and loyal militias are confronted by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group “Islamic State” in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States is supporting the rebels who are opposed to both Assad and IH.
The official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria has described the cause of the West's hostility to Russia.
West claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are indeed sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in the RT interview, First Channel, Russia 24, NTB, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, which would be for the benefit of Western countries and not his country, he noted.
Asad drew attention to a sharp turn of the Western media with the start of the Ukraine coup.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from another West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic manner, despite being elected by democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the “Islamic State”.
Commenting on the permanent statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did, at the request of the people, not by decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the President stays and otherwise he should leave immediately”, he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military sphere.
He refuted the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.

“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
With regard to the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-hygiel coalition known to the United States,” Asad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, which was banned in Russia.

Borodaj named the information the American newspaper slanderous of Strelkov.
The former Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroday, has refuted the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent, Lenta.ru.
The point in Washington Post is beautiful because it's all over the place.
The former DNR Minister of Defence, Igor Strelkov, of course, had no ties and “out” he “made out” of the Republics of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, with no three fur money attributed to him by different figures”, he noted.
According to Borodaj, it was Strelk’s conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper.
“Yes, I said it was urgent that Strelkova be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the former head of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Borodaj stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication had decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to Russia's “related” territory.
I suspect it's provocation.
If this is not provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov had left alone," said Borodaj.
"It's slander to me and to Strelkova," he concluded.
Previously, an article appeared on The Washington Post page listing Borodaya as taking Strelkov to Russia on a forced basis.
According to the publication, Borodaj noted that he had been forced to contact his associate.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish foresters began to cut trees above an underground tunnel, where according to some, the Third Reich gold train is located.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rumours about the railway composition with treasures.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals inside the train.
On 31 August, Polish Governor Tomas Smolarz of Lower Silesia suggested that there was no more convincing evidence of a train carrying gold than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cut off the search area.
Three days earlier, Polish Deputy Minister of Culture, Petar Zhukhovsky, said that local cemeteries "probed to be 99 per cent" found the same train with Third Reich gold as mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the valuables were found, they would be property of the State's execution, and the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Valbjih with a report that they had found a train in a blocked tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The RF chief drug dealer suggested that tobacco should not be sold to persons under the age of 21.
Russia's chief drug addict suggested that tobacco be banned until 21 years old.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
So he said on direct radio "Speak Moscow", commenting on information that the Speaker of the Sovelfeda Valentina Matvinko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army when you're 18, physically ready.
He's mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
“It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully mature by the age of 21,” said Brun.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and a project manager, Tresja Russia, Sultan Hamzaev, had informed “Notice” that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age price for alcohol sales and “agreed to raise the issue again at the floor of the House of Parliament.
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon set up a working group to draft a bill under the guidance of Matvienko.
The Bible has been asked to check compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to verify the Bible's compliance with the Federal Act on Protection of Children against Information That Harms Their Health and Development, which was issued on 16 September by the correspondent of Sib.fm.
The complainant stated that on 26 August 2015 he acquired a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society at the Chitai Town Shop on the Red Prospect.
In the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development".
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk.
The reply of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
More interestingly, the absurdity of the law itself was commented by the complainant to the correspondent, Sib.fm.
In addition, it is a fundamental problem that will arise in society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Union of Rio Grandi promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breast feeding: the method implies the demonstration of images of infants with breast-feeding depicted in images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant women and women born, it is recommended that the daily calorie level be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should do.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affected the gene expression of children and prevented their development from developing tumors.
Regrettably, the adverse effects of unhealthy nutrition on the immune system of the child have been identified.
Under Hamburg, a train ran a school bus.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that he could not get off the rails, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by a schoolboy.
There was panic among the students due to the emergency situation.
Some children began to cry and run along the side.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one train passenger who was slightly injured.
Accident damage was estimated at 300,000 euros.
The doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Browne, Jr.
On Monday, Brown, a 28 - year - old, died of injuries in a single cell with Carlo Magali, a Filipino.
One of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of 57.15 kg on Friday ended with Magali's knockout victory in the 12th round.
Brown went to a hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life-sustainment device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended with an extermination.
He has two children left.
This is the second flightout of Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AA now recommends that it should not be engaged in this sport, but rather, in its view, ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, said the vice president of the organization Steven Pernis.
But in the form of boxing, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads either to death or to severe injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together medical practitioners and students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narishkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
He made this statement at the OSCE PA session in Ulanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not happen again because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's put morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let's put the humanistic ideals back into democratic order.
"Two things never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group”, Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"It is almost the only common ground where there is still discussion of how to normalise the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Remember, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulanbaatar and will be extended until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple of days.
World Cup of Light Athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a 24-year-old lightweight from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the European Command Line at his 110-metre crowning distance, to set several records, and to become the world champion, the first in the history of a national barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Brilliant League", taking third place in general reading.
"New Reports" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergei, the season's not over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'm going to think about my vacation.
True, I'll be home in Barnaul now, and being home is still another condition.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said autumn is your favorite time of year.
At the end of August, the beginning of September is a beautiful time.
Passion after the main start of the season is over, the burden of responsibility is no longer strained.
You can argue with pleasure at relaxation.
Plus, you know, vacation's about to...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
Fatigue always builds up by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what he did anymore - win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Constant overflights, movements, all of this is not untraceable for the body.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But right now, I have feelings for the lift.
What's that? I'm just happy!
By the time they finished at the world championship in Beijing, are you coming back often?
It does.
And you journalists won't let me forget it.
But in general, I think that a bad athlete who lives through old victories is stirring up his successful runs over and over again.
He enjoyed winning a couple of days, and he's got to move on.
Has the preparation for this wonderful season been very different from the usual season?
I can't say it was that special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter season.
First, he trained at home in Barnaul, then at congregation meetings, then at home again.
The usual.
But with the coach, they set out to try to get to a new level that I've never been to.
Almost all winter time was spent setting up a base.
They ran a lot of crosses, they did exercises in general physical training, which included tension, and the neighborhood, and we pushed our backs.
Then, they took up barrier training, and they did a lot of tech.
How do rivals act, followed?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem with that in the Internet era.
I saw the winter European championship, and the French took the whole pedestal in a barrier sprint!
And I thought, you know, we need to do something, sort this company out.
With each start this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all these last seasons coming up on about the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running from 13.20, and then there's 13.50.
I'm always turning my shape slowly.
The main thing I wanted to do was escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel like you're ready to do something, and the competitions don't always make you feel like you're ready to do it.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
To be honest, that semifinal run (Shubenkov couldn't get into the finals.
It was pretty good, it could really have escaped for 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best performance at that point, he would be the bronze lake of the Games.
But it didn't work.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time. I was so programmed.
And he dropped out from tomorrow, in pre-emptive runs.
That's when I realized that breaking and breaking your head means not running away at all.
Two years later, the world championship in Moscow came to the finale with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive run: I was very eager to win the gold by then!
How do you manage not to lose your head while you're at it?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique to keep the barriers from falling.
I noticed that when you're not looking for a result, it's easier for the process.
And the high point when you get the feeling that you're running, and it's like it's working itself out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after their first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
You've never thought of it that way?
The house is still better.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
It might be good to have conditions better, but I try to be content with what I have.
Have you two been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, since he got into athletics.
Actually, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with sprint, then jumped in the long, triple.
The kid's polygamy was when they were throwing a ball, jumping long from place to place...
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first run, it has been possible to comply with the standards of the second adult level.
That's what's left.
There's never been a fear of barriers?
I had to deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work going on in technology.
He's been in so much trouble!
But there's nothing wrong with that routine.
The technique has to be pulled all the time, so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your run in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually watch my runs, and I couldn't stay here.
But there is no limit to efficiency.
Don't you fear now that the victory of the year before the Olympics will be on the shoulders of heavy burdens?
As they say, I will try to live up to my expectations.
Once you've chosen this road, it has to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any additional cargo.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I'm not naive enough to be amazed at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand their bread isn't food. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I wasn't wearing my flag, and the same thing, a million times I was talking here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard a bastard, I was hurt.
All my pseudo friends are in the dark in a second.
The press release to which I am subjected is so strong that even I, who has the type of boyfriend, think that the white people are hugging.
It's like he's walking, walking, and you're attacked by a crowd, and you're mutated.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm gonna hit the hood, old me, guys, I'm scared.
There is no support for any other matter.
I didn't have an illusion, and now...
I've always been the best self-sufficient person in my life, so try it.
And giving passports to creeps like Fred Derst or Monson can only be assholes.
I'd rather have a better journalist than a shy job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili in sharp form described the Crimean events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the undersigned Khrushchev tried to sign something is in no way consistent with the overall picture of the human residence.
It's like coming to the neighbor and picking up his hedge...
The Kremlin war has gone on, and it will only end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some bastard from the Kremlin.
I'm guessing who it might have been...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand. He's the greatest artist. Why does he need to lick Putin's hands?
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends solely on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise 7 is in charge despite 9th's attempts to shed light on the leader's game at Today Show.
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's exit to Canberra to highlight the impact of the Liberal Party's statement to liberate the leader's seat was unable to strongly raise Today's ratings.
The 9th morning show was broadcast from the capital of the state after Malcolm Turnbull Toni Abbott’s defeat.
Contestant Sunrise, led by David Koh and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
The torture seems to have been of little importance to Australian television players, with Sunrise having 397,000 viewers in five of the largest cities compared to Today’s 339 000 audiences.
Today gained slightly more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against 314 000 at Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification!

An important news for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thompson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of a family who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a popular show alone without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud yes response.
The X Factor of Seventh remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seventh, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Keefe gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00), the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators, enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuyra (613,000).
On Monday evening, Chase Australia’s first half - hour audience was 520,000, and the second half was 720,000.
The Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth silently admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute that failed to play the McGuyre show.

Three finalists agree that Holostak Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he going to pick?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snowman Marcoschi may have accidentally given us an idea of which one of them will win the Holostacks.
A woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in Holostak, surrounded by a covert curtain.
And the three before the girl's finals, of course, keep silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snow Markosky and Lana Jacksons Falloose the day before the three girls were left with two, they may have given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until the final on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, describing why Wood is an ideal man, mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, and vitality as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should receive the last Rose of Voodoo?" they could have been reluctant to tell which one of them actually won the Heart of Holostic.
They named McKay the perfect match for Wood without doubt.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined the participants, I felt the energy and energy of Sam and realized that they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jacksons-Fallowes.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," Markoski added.
I saw them together, they're really attracted to each other.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be the person he was.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it wasn't just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she said.
When asked who Voodoo should be chosen, if not her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarrid Hain had several options for starting a career in NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his transfer to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Thomsula, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian League League player allowed on the first return of the pant to the winning game with Minnesota at 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayna another opportunity to return the pant, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of giving the newbies away in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
Club Special Reporter 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGee, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
At the beginning of the debut in NHL, Hayne and his numerous Australian worshipers evidently did not count.
It was seen that Hayne was fighting, leaving the field after the loss of the ball, and he later told the lead show "Hamish and Andy" at the Australian 2DayFM 104.1 radio station, which he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful career start in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and that's all," said Haine.
Hayne compared his failures to the debut of the Origin series in 2007, when the ball drop in his recovery zone made an attempt on Queensland.
Ultimately, this experience has proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a photo with Australian flags and fans after the game and posted the picture in Instagram.

The country ' s authorities allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and transport them to the country in question.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of State territories, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for processing asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer to the Hungarian armed forces of functions to protect the country ' s borders as soon as possible.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.

“Responsors like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security”, said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is in danger of 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a fine of a million dollars.
In sentencing, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce its time frame.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At that time another suspect, Dmitri Smilian, was taken into custody.
The last of his guilt for the crimes he has been convicted of has denied it.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian MID head Sergey Lavrov, US Secretary John Kerry warned that the support of Russia's Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that the Russian support of President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power”, says a report published on the United States Department of State.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the faction of the Islamic State (the activity of which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
Prior to the White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join an international coalition that conducted an anti-Terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
The media has recently reported frequently the presence of Russian troops in Syrian territory.
To this end, Russian MID head Sergei Lavrov claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians acquire technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when police fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, approximately 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some were throwing stones and firing bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing the rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last of several weeks of bitter protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the Tara people who wish to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, it was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the Kathmandu draft constitution this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to create an enterprise in 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as the centre of the chemical industry, and has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Saiansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, he described new projects and prospects to the Correspondent of the District.
Oleg Valerevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I took note of the results of the financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit review of local budget expenditure.
Municipal property audit was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the paperwork to five days.
In the past, the paperwork could have walked for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize expenditure.
In November last year, a government retreat was held in Saiansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project documentation in the city (PSD) on any facility.
Without that, Sayansk was unable to participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the road, the kindergarten, the northern sewage collector and the water supply.
Road work on two sites is already under way.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics have not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
Thus, the issue of housing in kindergartens is one of the most relevant for today.
Since 1 September, it has been closed to the capital repair of the Children's Detsad No. 10 for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
This is the kind of money the city has never received.
Last year a kindergarten No. 23 opened after the renovation, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repairs were made under co-financing from the regional and local budgets and cost more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the Regional Government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme.
There are plans to start a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
We have no order for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be carried out, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and that it is precisely the work that must be done.
As early as October, a 60-bedroom orphanage for orphans in the Leningrad microregion was in operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangari, which entered the eco-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 clusters will begin soon.
In all, we have declared the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a “key” section.
If we can handle the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the program.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In due course, the Saiyan swine complex, which was sold at no cost in 2004, was built on the ground.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the facility is federally owned.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion roubles in reconstruction and launching.
We'll have 900 jobs with the pig complex, which will be a great help to the city.
Sayansk developed a social partnership institution?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Businesses such as East Centre ZAP, New Winter TEC, Sayan Broiler, MDF PCP, and the management of these enterprises have responded to all calls.
Directly to the Day of the City of Siyańsk Broiler, the East Centre gave the town a children's town to repair the horseyard, where professionals handle the children's hypatherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Sponsorships have been able to build the city's ZAGS territory.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s day beautifully.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The story of the city, the book of the Sa'an poets, was released.
Jubilee medals are given to the first and the first-timers and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Siyańsk.
The mecentans also participate in the work of the City Charity Fund.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800,000 rubles are directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are social human resources problems addressed in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and trainers.
The provision of shelter by professionals is essential to address the human resources issue.
During the past year, we provided five apartments for doctors, and four teachers were provided with official housing.
We have a housing programme with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans are to redecorate the building, with eight more pedagogue apartments to be built.
Teachers and doctors are also participating in the “House for the Russian Family” programme.
In the future, building a house for budget workers.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in town with which I can handle the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Siyańsk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of welfare in the light of price increases.
A bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually has been introduced in the State of the Congo since 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, Ambassador Alexander Lomakin-Romansev of “Equitable Russia”, also proposes to conduct an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth of living minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
The indexation of welfare according to existing legislation has been carried out annually since 1 April, taking into account the growth of the pensioner ' s living minimum in the FP over the past year.
The draft law introduced in the lower room provides for the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the pace of consumer price increases.
The first indexation is carried over to 1 February and the second is to be carried out on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Mogherini that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs of the Federation, Mogherini Speaker of the OSCE PA Ilkka Cannerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly were inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
As TASS reports, signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been collected in support of Kanera ' s position.
"There is already strong enough support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the Head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures of MPs that had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In particular, noting Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the governing structures of the European Union and to "send the respective petition".
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape islands is likely to turn 60 per cent into a tropical cyclone for the next 48 hours, the National Centre for Hurricanes reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area, approximately in the middle between the Green Mis Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 per cent probability of developing tropical cyclones in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a Double Donations campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a doubling campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist European refugee prisoners fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-characteristic personal approach, anoking a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the managers, Google Rita Massoud, who had fled with her family from Kabul at the age of seven, described her personal experience.
"We arrived on questionable trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be provided to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugee and migrant assistance: “Terms Without Borders”, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first 5.5 million dollars in donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerelief page reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has left over 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with minor obesity may help in obesity surgery
The benefit after surgery of obesity in people with a small type 2 diabetes may be at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetes with a little obesity is longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“The statistics on mortality are not immediate,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and restrict the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) of 35 or more.
IMT, weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above indicates that overweight people and people with IMTs above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from Taiwan hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and larynx gastrectomy with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low obesity.
The mean value of IMTs in those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their study.
At the same time, those receiving non-surgical treatment with diabetes remain at approximately 29.
Of those who carried the operation, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially treated.
In the treatment group, only 1% and only approximately 2% were treated for complete diabetes treatment and partial treatment.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors said.
Researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1s levels that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Haemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycaemic controls, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the research manager Dr. Chi-Chang Su and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgery.
For the fifth year, compared to a group that had acquired a rudder gastrictomy, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction of IMT (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1s (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and was also closer to total diabetes remission (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to the University of Arizona, the University of Phoenix, Blackstone from the College of Medicine.
According to a Swedish study for obese people selected by bariatric interventions, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than the group used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged those with IMT below 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is a very important report because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT falls within the range of 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they have accumulated genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Customs, the robbers took out their coats and 9 million roubles.
In Mythice, robbers attacked the people of the submersible house and stole 9 million roubles and three women ' s coats.
This is reported by Interfax, referring to the media service of the IMF.
There was an incident on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house on Gorkoya Street and tied a 20-year-old son to the house, threatening both with a knife, and took 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damages amounted to 9 million 265,000 roubles, and a criminal case under the heading “Breaking”.
Fans from Europe are at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the world football championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still in a hurry to obtain a permit.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the world, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the city’s guests.
Robsbalta interlocutors believe that the tournament will increase rental costs by 10-30 per cent, and after the divergent home championship, it will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup football team has made the authorities pay attention to the status of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written for the first time, every hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is now understandable that not all of us can do this: the hotelers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Anti-Monopular Service in St. Petersburg.
As UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov said, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply failed to respond to the anti-monopolists.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies has deceived the city by placing a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that at present, virtually every number can not be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the soccer championship, the sicksters will take over all the Petersburg hotels.
Tourists can now count on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two- and three-star, 550-star.
According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified so far, so many of the checks were carried out by the companies accredited to Petersburg.
And here is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, the Smolder of Unsurprising Cases.
I mean, there may be more classifications, but no one knows about it.
“The last six months of the hotel did not make much effort to be classified,” acknowledged the Director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union of Tourism, Ekaterina Shadska.
This is due to the high season during which the hotel earns the most money and does not want to engage in other business.
Another reason is the budgets in which no verification costs have been incurred, and the procedure may cost the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 rubles and more.
However, in recent times hotel managers have intensified and have applied for classification, Shadsky assured.
The hotel has to make it by 1 July 2016, otherwise not only will they pay the fine, but they will not have the right to work for the world championship.
It is already known that according to the stars, a fixed fee for the hotel room will be developed during the tournament.
The formulas for calculating the value will be released next year.
This is done in order to prevent 200 to 300 per cent of prices from taking off, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not let it rise two or three times, but the hotel has to make a living.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” explained the President of the Russian Hospitality Association Gennady Lampshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how far that goes with economic theory, but I hope it's justified.
“It’s better to travel without restraint,” he noted.
It's not clear what happens to popular cheap hostels.
The members of the State passed a bill stating that hostels should be banned in housing.
It is highly hoped that this law will not be passed or addressed to St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Guachia said.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-houses should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the Lord approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the hostels in St. Petersburg, and currently there are 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorators and Hotels in North West Leonid Garbar, two- and three-star hotels are missing in St. Petersburg, which are just used by football painers, but there is a gap towards four-star and five-star hotels.
This is similar to the situation in which “75,000 Vips sit in the 80th-th-thousand stadium”.
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible prohibition is considered "idiotism": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, and that's why they can't come."
If a hostel is used as a dormitory, I agree that this is wrong.
But if it is a hotel where guests arrive for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hospitals are at risk of missing the world's football championship and because of their lack of momentum.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to pass the classification, and they're swarming with themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotel rooms will be ordered.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from the mini hotel but will choose those who travel”, said Gennady Lampshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the checks carried out so far are much higher than the Petersburgs.
The cause of the St. Petersburg delay is linked, including to the constant changes in the government's tourist bloc, which is not conducive to a coherent work.
Experts believe that if the Petersburg hotels are not enough, everyone will likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300th anniversary of Petersburg in the city can mobilize a river fleet, i.e. guests of the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many sick people will arrive on vans to stay overnight.
"The main thing is not to set up as many hotels as you can so that they can leave," I'm sure of Gennady Lampshin.
Also popular during football championships will be remote housing.
Most likely in the city they'll build a reserve of rented apartments.
Rent rates will rise by 10-30 per cent.
“Obviously, the first will be to leave the residence near the stadium”, noted Larissa Bragin, a resident of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research.
At the same time, the rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be supported by the construction of new transport routes on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
It is worth not forgetting the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonidas Garbar is convinced that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only tell the road but can also take a mini tour.
There are complications.
In the 1970 ’ s, my father met a family from Murmansk, his father, his mother, and two children.
They found it difficult to sleep with hotels at the time.
"And the pope brought them to our common apartment to sleep," the interviewer recalled.
True, he added that there was no such thing left in the city right now - calling home with consequences and fear.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State, might the mistakes of the hotel and government have to be remembered?
Jurinovsky "Shill" Amura region.
He looked with admiration at the Gyrinovsky Clown in Gosdam today.
He did things like this when our generation was just learning to trade in newspapers, and he's still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the statement is, it seems, “the LDLR protest against the results of the elections in the Amura region”.
The protocols are not shaken, for there is nothing; there are no other protocols, except those signed by the selectors, which appear to have an LDP.
He raises up Ivan Abramov's second place and shouts, "This is the winner of the election."
And there's nothing coming out of the Rodin, and then, after having had sex with the chairman, he's taking the faction out of the conference room, screaming, literally, "You're all with the fronts of your bug and thief."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on scandal and demarcation of factions as a result of this scandal and insult.
The Amura region, along with Abramov, was beautifully and elegantly linked by Wolfovich.
For the country as a whole, this is a follow-up of Girinovsky's “Podonki” style, not a protest by the political party against the results of the specific elections.
Both the faction formally scandalized, and the election, if you believe the party's website and the Facebook site of Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously coming down on the subject.
He leaves the dead on Amura to bury his dead himself, and he himself preaches against the One Russia as a whole and should not be a relative.
A fine decision not to lose a person, not to go into a real scandal.
Another thing is that Abram himself is now in a strange situation.
Apart from the heat from the authorities, he didn't wait for anything, there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other hand, for a narrow circle he has become a formal occasion and an insult to a respected champion, and, more importantly, the Hammacks to the ER and ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the number two and candidate number one policy into the only regional single-member district, it can become a money that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-insultor for the same ONF and party leadership.
Certainly, it would not have been Jyrinovsky, and it should have been invented and observed with respect.
Tramp's still growing and growing.
There was news that LDDR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nowhere.
The only thing is, the subject of Abram's funeral.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, devoted to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in existing circumstances, the interests of humanity must be higher than those of individual countries or even of continents.
He also stressed that, while this was a cause for admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he noted in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama expressed its appreciation for Germany and Austria ' s response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you should think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and current development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist acts, stating that the U.S. harsh reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that it was possible to address the problem through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand sanitizer over the past 4 years
The United States toxicology centres reported an increase of nearly 400 per cent, starting in 2010, in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high alcohol disinfectant, according to the Georgian toxicology centre.
According to Dr. Haylord López, director of the Georgia toxicology centre, the cases of children under 12 years of age for hand sanitizers reported at toxicology centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“The children are more likely to be in contact with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are being sent to the emergency room,” said López CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant separately, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show adolescents drinking disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents are said to have mixed disinfectant fluid with spirit - containing fluids to polish their mouths in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Children of younger age may be attracted to pleasant odors of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," López said.
Many of the most attractive (defining liquids for hands) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfectant fluids for hands with the smell of tubers, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant contains about 45 to 95 percent of the alcohol.
Young children, especially young children, have only a few distractions that can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave the whiskey on, but people look at these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant for her hands with tuberic aroma of about four sprays at school, had been sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett medical center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic to avoid any signs of brain trauma, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchie told her.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naji's mother.
This could well have been fatal for my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-spirt substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids from children ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposite” teacher through the “proliferation of antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to the police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she's forbidden to keep them in her classroom.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty talks” and addressed discipline issues to the school district.

The earliest readers in the twentieth century had made loud readings, performed performances on the poems of Majakovsky, conducted literary Victorians, and rewritten with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper Uny Stalinets wrote in 1939, “the friendship between Hope Constantinovna Krupa and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaula” grew stronger and stronger each day.
Nadja Constantinovna even sent her childish photograph to distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the barnauls asked if Hope Constantinovn objected to the library’s taking her name, she wrote that she did not, did not object.
Letters have long been squandered at the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of the early readers have to explain what the harsh profile is about to embellish at the library building.
During the years of restructuring, different people often called, resented: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Make it a library of some good child writer's name, no political colors!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
Krudsky is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a “leenka” in Moscow.
On the floor of the library, there's a yellow brick track.
"The Magician of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moscow.
Olya used to be the manager of a law firm, she came to work at eight, she left at five, and all the other managers were just a love of painting.
And then she found an online announcement, "It takes an illustrator for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom has cancer."
Olya did illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no wonder in her if you didn't create them yourself.
It now works in a library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and makes up stories.
Traditionally, children are thought to lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have reading children, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says the Russian World Library Director Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and she's going to live, and the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby there is a large exhibition display with an updated photo exhibition.
Once new photos of readers are posted in the neighborhood, they go to the library with the whole family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library rejoices that the popes are increasingly with their children.
When a child is two years old and reads all Chukovsky, he needs books more complex when he is older.
But there is now a law under which eight-year-old wunderkind is prohibited from publishing books in category 12+.
To get a book like this, the child has to bring his parents with him - they come back, then they come back again, and gradually Krupsky becomes like a family club to them.
There are treasures in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of raves with aths and eras, to take Queen in the annex to Niva magazine, the 1936 Murzilki book.
After all, not only are we now the conceptual space of the book temple, but we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, explains Tatyana Cushvid.
We can come to read, play, draw together.
We made a play zone for the kids, the kid comes to play, and the hand's still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are being kidnapped by their parents, and they resisted their feet, and they did not want to leave.
Mothers with bicycles often come, and we are glad that they put the library first among all the other places to go with the little ones.
Tatyana Kushvid says that modern children like we used to love classical children's literature:
“The creative work is now under way, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to little kids, it's important for them to be some kind of character who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes tracts for parents telling them what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but the library isn't for them after all.
No books outside the adult reading room are allowed.
This magical privilege is reserved for children only.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in a bookstore.
The stairs will creak under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend. Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ally's still walking along the yellow brick road, Toll Rizickov's ribbon is stealing magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalš you never told the cursed bourgeoiss of the War's Secret, he's got such a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can find your own in any place.
There are also actual book rares in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of ravines with aths and eras.
Or take Queen in the famous annex to Niva magazine.
Or "Murzilki" for 1936.
Time has grown old, and it has decorated them with tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's the scraps of our future collection, and I'm all about to retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the kids don't do that anymore, so to speak, and the colors in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, says the Russian Planet, Galina Ilasova, who runs the bookstore.
The Murzillas have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna's been running a bookstore her whole life.
She knows the color of Buratino's hats, in what academic year Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in which Carlson uses a silencer for a motorbike, and who his father, Alice Selezneva, works for.
The librarian is paid little for his work, and those who can live without these book rows find another profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, book - worship workers.
They can also be found in a smile - it is believed to be the professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I like children's books at all: how I like the librarians to be, to be straight and beautiful on the shelf, and I love reading them,” says Galina Vasilievna.
I read all: military, historical lead, fairy tales, fiction.
I'm reading contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them foolishly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the rye.
And I look forward to it when our former readers bring in children, including grandchildren...
There's no disagreement in Seltica.
Griffiths denied talking about differences in Seltica after admitting Dale that Hups was in a bad place, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nailson, and Wharberton fears signing contracts in January that may violate the unity of the team.
The Dons have increased their advantage over Celtic to five points.
The Adam Rooney Penalts in the first time gave Aberdeen a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to get away from Celtics for five points.
Griffiths vindicated the discussion of differences
This led to rumours of differences in Seltica that were cut by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are after him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the title fight - de Bur
Former Rangers half-defendant and former Dutch member Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football players lost interest in Seltica because he did not compete for the Rangers title.
De Bur, currently a representative of Aiaxa, said, "In Holland, the most attractive points of the game are no longer displayed "Seltica", and why?
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm's games, and not just people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
As a result of the defeat from Malmo and the League of Champions, 10 Aberdeen footballers were soon lost, which now takes up the top five points.
But Dale said, "Selicate had bad periods before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton with mistrust awaits January transfers
Despite the views that emerged only a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, Mark Warburton, the head of the Rangers, mistrustfully referred to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Formerly attacking "Brentford" said, "Janwar Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period to adapt them, as you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in Seltic, hinted that his career would be over.
Suonsy Mitch, who was connected to Seltic during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave football after his contract with the swans ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from problems with his ankle for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to confront the SFA over Nelson's allegations.
"Harts" accounted for 2:1, when Patterson was removed, and they lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later canceled; it was the third red card of the Colum, which was cancelled in eight months.
Nailson does not deny his words, arguing, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tynkasl
The stubborn playoff of the Haiburnian team was excused after admitting that he sang a song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudy Skatzel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tyncassla in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was burning," the attacker added, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to Tynkasl if he wasn't playing for Celtic."
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident of Dundee United management.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundy United Board of Directors remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We shall prepare the children to go out again," Donnelly said.
McKinness is glad he won the Hamiltons.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team, Aberdeen, had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh in a row in the league, which put them five points above Seltica, on the top of the tournament table, thanks to the Adam Rooney penalty in the first time.
McInness said, "There's not a team here that wins anything -- a cup or league champion who hasn't won a meeting like this."
The level of unemployment among Scottishs does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
INSTITUTIONS in Scotland remained at 164,000 persons between May and July, while the number of non-working people in the United Kingdom in general increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as the National Statistics Service (ONS) figures showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the current number of employees being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
Minister of Scotland David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market of Scotland in increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to the death in Oklahoma
Today, while avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will see a man being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the death chamber of Oklahoma County Prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so they won't let me pick up a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of being impartial in Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner the story as he likes it, get access.
I felt sorry for her.
She admitted that “I could make better things myself” but still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with one of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international publication journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the death penalty movement.
Kim Bellver, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I won't go into detail here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip isn't to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom this can be addressed.
From me, you'll know what it's like to see a man who I like die without need.
A man being chased by the police has been told to leave the Canning River
Constable, from the town of Canning Valley, managed to convince the man to leave the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police, but failed to get stuck in dirty water in shallow water within a few metres from a police officer trying to "easy get him off the coast".
Canning Valley police were called on Tuesday on the illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I won't go out, come on, catch me,' said Sergeant Shandel Castleday.
Constable Laklan Perjavec was not keen to urinate his uniform, so he used a safer reception -- "negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Castleday.
That's what football champion Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Cassins went to Quevet to avoid meeting with a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but the locals were encouraged to invent Ben Kazins's ridiculous "Biatlon".
Peter Moody accuses flight attendants of espionage and threatens to leave a horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
Its target was the stewards and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, who he accused of campaigning against him personally, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatai due to a violation of the drug regulations on the day of the start on Wednesday became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the jumps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive result of the Leadery's cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his mouth shut about the suspicions of espionage for six and a half years and didn't want it to "look like a green vineyard."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've endured for a long time, but sometimes it kicks you out of the wheel so much that you don't hold back," Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'm going home and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody made a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to give him information about what I was doing in my stable,” Moody said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all, of course, make statements because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rawlston, former RVL President David Moody, current RVL President, and Bernard Sondri, the external executive director of RVL, knew all along and knew it now.
Shouldn't that make me think this is getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to answer for what's going on in this business, other people than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now, maybe make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and make them responsible for decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's boredom only grew during a long investigation of the cobalt and the Leaders, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him claim that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, most famous for preparing Black Caviar's undefeated champion, described the requirements for the use of medicinal products on the day of competition as “mixable” after a clay compress was placed on horse legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
“I must be fully responsible for this,” he said.
One of my employees made a mistake compression on her leg.
She could get compressions last night.
She could've gotten it yesterday, just like she was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the compression competition, for which stewards have opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who made an attack and hid from the Kobram accident, arrested
The police arrested a man who knocked down a motorcyclist in Cobra on weekends and hid from the scene.
The rider was taken to the helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car at Murray Valley High on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help a wounded motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man in Natalia surrendered to the police in Sheppartone.
It is expected that he will be charged with abandoning the scene of the accident, not providing assistance and violating other traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, remains in hospital in stable condition.
"Melburn Storm" coach Craig Bellamy challenges rivals in the use of tough power supplies.
Coach "Melburn Storm" Craig Bellamy called the ball interception criticism his team as "implanting the agenda" by two NRL favorites.
Sedney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the judges had allowed Storm to “fight” his team during the sudden victory of Storm in the Sydney qualifying finals on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbein Broncos" Wayne Bennet made a clear hint on Storm after his team won the final qualifying tournament at the Nosern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called this game "typical" for the regby league and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "good luck" in a mining event.
Bellamy defended the ball interception by his team and stated that they were simply focused on contact by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was assured of the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, as it meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat from Storm.
"This continues to rise -- I did not hear Trent Robinson talking about harsh receptions when they played us with a 24-2 bill," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our security systems or techniques, it's just over the past six weeks that we've been paying special attention to contact when we intercept the ball, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly trained a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a shock to him.
It's funny how this is always happening this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of an impressive football game, reminding his teacher that St. George-Illavarra Dragons won the championship in 2010, showing the boring football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game Saturday night with our game Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy noticed.
I remember that St. George's had a lot of criticism in 2010, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that observation in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-protectors like Anthony Millford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rousters game was a match with more points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is that impressive football?
Or do breaks and failed attempts seem impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At the end of this week's Storm, because they won the right to take either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronal Sharks next Saturday night at the AAMI Park pre-finals, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
The Serbian drug charge is issued at $200,000
A man threatened with life imprisonment for trying to embezzle 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland smuggled was bailed out at $200,000.
Marko Maksimović, 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilos of drugs on the Solay yacht, which is a South American ride through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
All morning, Maximovich and his associates were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite Maximovic ' s life expectancy for trying to assign drugs in sufficient quantities for sale, attorney Maximovic argues that there is no evidence that the last attempt to win the whole party is lacking and that the man could have been in a café without any intention.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted Maximovich's worth of bail.
The latter has connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather were asked to make a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“It is clear from both statements that the $200,000 bet is too much of a financial burden for them,” said Judge Flanagan.
But one measure was not enough to guarantee that he would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he gives both his Australian passport and his Serbian passport, will be paid daily to the police and will observe the curfew from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Phototis Katzikaris: "I'm afraid of the assembly of Greece that fought until the last seconds."
The main coach of the Greek assembly, Fotis Katzikaris, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the Eurobasket 2015 final with Spain (71:73).
He said that some mistakes had been made in the game.
It was a big game, says AFP Katzikaris.
We were getting ready for a great Spanish game.
They tried to work in the defense, but the defence's faults determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: I will be assigned to Kauna in the CSC.
Novice KSKA Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the Armenians.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer, and after I joined the team, he quoted Friland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to re-engineer myself to the downtown position, but I've been playing a lot more forward at NBA.
Now it's going to take more than a major center of competition, but I've done it before, so I think I can do it now.
The Armenians last won the Euroliga in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to Final Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team's been squished.
In this game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its infirmities.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning the Euroliga, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As far as the eye is concerned, I am not a superstitious man, nor do I believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any rituals before or before the games, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "To me, the game with Roma will be special."
The head coach of the Barcelonas, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome for the 1st round of the League of Champions' group tournament with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his current and former team's eye will be far from regular for him.
Let us recall that Luis Enrique was training wolf during season 2011/12, but he failed to show himself on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I had gained some experience.
I have exclusively fond memories of Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions with a victory.
The August meeting in Cuba, Joana Gamber, will not affect the team's actions in the next match.
I'm waiting for the Roma game she showed up in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can rescind and know what to do with a ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: “Brasnodar” has different types of attacks.”
Acting chief coach, Urala Vadim Skripchenko, at the front of the 9th Tour of the League, noted the diversity of attack patterns of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several patterns of attack in their arsenal.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will begin at 4.30 p.m. in Moscow.
As we play with "Bradnodar," we'll see, the official website "Urala" brings in the words "Kripchenko".
We've got a week of training ahead of us.
This team has different types of attack, carries out its attacks in a variety of ways, and we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the front of this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the League of Europe against Dortmund, we will try very well to prepare to win the victory.
Roher Kanyas: "House of Astana" can pick up anybody's glasses."
Astana champion Roher Kanjas expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League's Champions League with Benfika (0:2).
According to the Habbek, the restaurateurs on their own field are able to take the points off any rival.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can tell you that we played well, brings in the official UEFA site the words of Kanyas.
"Benfika" is above class, but in the homecoming match, I think we can count on them to pick out their glasses.
It's real.
But first you have to think about Galatasare, then you have to think about Atletico.
At home games, we can take our glasses off any one of them.
Rafael Benites: "Against every time: Christian Ronald is the best in the world."
Raphael Benites, chief coach of the League of Champions, expressed his satisfaction at the big victory in the 1st round of the League of Champions' League Championships with Chatter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Kristian Ronald, who became the author of the three heads.
The match was not easy because Schachter can own the ball, he's bringing in the official UEFA website of Benites.
The rival didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying that Real played the perfect game, but we've had enough of the lead.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and beat four.
Kristian Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it as many times as I can.
Jordy Alba: "Christian Ronald cannot be compared to Massey."
Barcelon's protector, Jordy Alba, believes that no one can compare him to Lionel Massey's scoundrel.
According to the Spanishman, forvard "Reala" Christian Ronaldo can't do that either.
Massi on five heads above the others, quoted Le Figaro Alba as saying, "What Leo can do, no one can do."
Even Kristian Ronald.

The meeting will be tomorrow, starting at 9:45 a.m. Moscow time.
Remember, the "SE" will broadcast it textually.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, quoted from the official website of UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with a blue grenade, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.

Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to look for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered with the Internet service for transmission of messages, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked him out and found shocking pictures, and immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police came and saw five images and then examined the computers found at this address and found the "appropriate" requests in the search engine using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "bring the pedophiles" and then he would "freak that he was a police officer to scare them."
Commissioner Aileed Robertson informed the Dundee sheriff's court: “He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be cops to scare the pedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with the unknown person who sent him the images and about asking him to send more photographs.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on the phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then an eye rate was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making obscene photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of the bet on 25 January of this year and not being brought to trial on 24 March of this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to list Hogga as he could prove that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October until he received social services reports.
Hogg was placed on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before the hearings in other cases.
It was listed by persons who committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African government leader, fell off the podium earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but a video with a fall scene just spread out on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against Mugabe’s advocacy at the time of the appeal.
A month ago, they whistled at the President when he approached the nation in parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning against interrupting Mugabe.
“The message came from a number that is not represented, but is entitled “Death”,” he told reporters after the Mugabe speech was completed.
The noted members of Parliament had warned that the integrity of the Parliament was ending in the building, and as soon as they came out, parliamentary integrity was not in effect.
A member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Tswangirai was “disturbed” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reduction of service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two listed companies, separating computer and printer production from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in employment would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, according to the Hewlett-Packard statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused and less focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn more than $50 billion a year and “focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions”, reports the company's statement.
This is how a company formed in the 1930s by the Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Pakard for the production of electrical equipment, their garage in Palo Alto, is called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a step HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the major US technical companies, is a recent development in this sector, based on confidence that narrow-minded companies are working better.
"Arsenala" Michel Arteta says that his teammates must support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing the Dynamo Zagreb game.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's restoration was to go as planned, nothing would prevent him from going back to the game for Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will accurately miss at least four of the next games in England and, in view of what has happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains at stake.
More than anything in this recent problem, Wilshire was confidently ending his previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the long bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
This has nothing to do with the ankles or the injuries he sustained earlier.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Prime Minister Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries in six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 games of the Arsenal in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for the Arsenal wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs that accounted for most of the injuries of the days.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, once you're back in shape after the injury, you're vulnerable for a while -- you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to make it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, as well as that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a competition in the League on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday, with a "Tottenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to rotate the band.
Viktor Belerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Matthew Debusi and Arteta will play in the starting line.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olive Jiro instead of Nacho Moreza and Theo Volcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little breath to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a unconditional favourite in group F, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most embarrassing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they had last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was impacted by an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson of last season when the team suffered a defeat in the games of the League of Champions of Monaco, and remains in poor hopes of bringing the club to victory in the Cup finals.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us some serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories falls into the eye, especially given how desperate the need for men to be honest is now more than ever, with the level of suicide among young men at the most in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of “Company against Accidental Life”, the year 2015 was announced by men to challenge a culture that does not allow men to ask for help when they need it.
The friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 students of universities who exhibit symptoms of depression found that if a patient has enough friends “in a normal mood”, the chances of treatment doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends doubles the risk of heart problems.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, we need it to be.
In an era when communications are managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to look strong, to love fun and success, even if in reality there is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call the external values of money, image, social status, the whole of our inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noticed, video game creator, you're not going to buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each of the characters was not determined by his work, but rather by the person who appeared in association with his friends.
Joy's humor and Chandler's constant embraces, the moments of football viewing on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighing on Rachel -- it all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens said to me: "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often the men who approach us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching “live with this” is as strong as the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.”
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the small points of male friendship.
With regard to my assignment, the status of a foreigner speaking on the phone helps people at times of despair, and long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you completely restored decorations for the holiday, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person in Starbucks, smile and say "Hi."
I can't guess what friendship can do.
The series Friends show at Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria hits the goal by helping the F.B.I. to crush Malmo.
Angel de María, like Blaze Matthew and Edison Cavanaugh, celebrates the slain swords at the Malmö gate.
Angel de María, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal by allowing "FGM" to easily bypass "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edison Cavanaugh did their job when Parry Saint-Jereman began his game at the Champions League with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmoo at Park de Prance Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions was launched as a PJ player to direct the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavanaugh scored a 61-minute goal.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donate Chatter in Group A, Parry had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they aimed not at playing off, but at continuing a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in attacking and later to replace him in the field against the team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a home or a guest at the Champions League, so win a 2-0 account, deliver a challenge to the rivals and play great in the defense - it's a good start, even if there are other moments that we're going to have to work out over the season," Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2:2 account in a match with Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but moved him to Di Maria's back plan for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing "FGM" to a new level in Europe, after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he escaped from Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malmo and beautifully completed the attack, he sent the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting a small and large victory from the FGM at the time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated Seltik in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine global players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two middle-field team champions, was a major opponent.
But with the exception of Nikola Jurdžić's blow, with the ball flying past Kevin Trapp's far stand for 34 minutes, they attacked very little.
However, at times, the FGM has failed to carry out its own unproductive transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half alone failed to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to handle the ball that was killed by Kavani immediately after the game was reinstated.
Nevertheless, he proved to be much more skilled in the exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, after having received the ball, sent by a stiff blow, which passed right through the stall near Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of marking thanks to Kavanaugh, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to the center of the field with the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any idea that Malmö had about going back into the game, and only the interception of the Viland ball at a close distance prevented David Lewis from increasing the final score before Esekiel Lavessy was replaced by the goal at the very end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are insufficient.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a great match with them.

Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Sochino Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between the regions, important links between the two States.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko will participate in the plenary.
The plenary and sectional meetings will discuss the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory security and programmes of the Federal State.
The Tumenian Governor will address the forum.
I believe that this demonstrates successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of the specialized ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than 200 delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumensk and Minsk areas was signed.
The importance of our efforts is also reflected in the fact that the Tumani meeting of the permanent seminar with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus has been held.
Furthermore, the APC delegation of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During his meeting with the Governor of the Tumensk region, Vladimir Yakushev was concerned with the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in the present difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - it is necessary to reduce the cost of machinery for the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshina Chamber of Commerce and in the prevention of loss.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and make a profit for the region.
There was talk of further shipments of passenger and cargo equipment by OAS, the development of the OAS "MAZ" service centre, which was established in Tumenia on the OAS TPATP basis.
The discussion also touched upon the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation between the Tumene region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise to move on to a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
During our meeting with the head of the Tumenia administration, Alexander Moore, we spoke about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already in the shade, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAO elevator production, Mogilevliftmash, with a complete kit.
In my view, these activities could become more active, given the programmes to install new elevators in the district centre.
I would add that, within the framework of the expanded powers of the Consulate, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of the increase in the trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaural.
A meeting with the Ombudsman was scheduled at the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five members of the RF, but the Tumen may be called the county headquarters.
The region is a clearinghouse for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Genconsul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good at enabling direct and rapid solutions to many problems by removing them and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is crucial not to destroy the hit while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people working in film production
Matt Damon argued with African American producer Effy Brown, claiming behind the scenes that there was no need to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday show Project Greenlight on HBO, a prominent actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the selected scenario.
"Many things are appropriate when you're casting for the movie itself, not the show," Damon insisted.
Stunning Brown, not believing her ears, was insultingly saying, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Ben Afflek and the Farelli brothers joined the production team to discuss the show's finalists to Damon and Brown.
"I would like participants, who will be the director, to think about what interpretations of the image of Harmony they are going to follow," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer was for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho to be the director of the film; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "We can end up getting what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media burst into disapproval with Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke bitterly of the video: "Explanation of the essence of diversity by Matt Damon to the only black person in such a room BELLOE, which is painful."
Twitt's got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "like".
Damon's statements appear at a time when the literacy of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colorful population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement at the Grammy Awards ceremony, when presenting candidates for the "Albom Year" nomination.
"Albom still matters," he said.
Like books and black people's lives, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Mather movement issued a formal statement in response to a question posed by Fox News staff members, Elizabeth Hasselbeck, about whether the group would be regarded as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Network is a group of love," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business, producers and media magnates invited to the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with Papaya.
"American Ninja Warrior" award-winning first champion
Professional Rock and Assistant Officer Isaac Kaldiero won the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking $1 million home.
In this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to get through all the stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Kaldjero and cameraman Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task included a 75 - foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to meet the challenge and made himself the first athlete in all of American Ninja Warrior's history, which was in phase 4, but Caldero did it for three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After winning an incredible job, Kaldjero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
“It’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year,” said Izek to E journalists! such a serious leap in my income.
And then all of a sudden... I never even imagined what it was like... the future was unknown.
The executive producer, Kent Wyd, met with the reporters of The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why Britten, who was the first to pass the route, would not receive any money.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
"If the finishers are more than one, the prize is the fastest of them," said Wid.
While money is a wonderful reward and a change of life, it still enjoys great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any harm about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He's got tons of exciting feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was meant to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we changed our roles.
The American Ninja Warrior will be back with the eighth season, which will begin in the spring of 2016.
"Detert Tigers" silently goes by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- the second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now taking the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
All they're trying to do is get in the way, Tigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a score of 5-4 on Target Field.
Twins missed a chance to cut half-game back from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by number of points after the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the letter F, which slipped away most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, leading Detroit to score three points in the first two innings, then add one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 of the innings and missed three wounds.
It was just his third high-quality launch for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
I don't get to throw the pitchers in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated Tigers, Victor Martinez, was able to take three punches and hit two shots, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since the four hits against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked well," said Osmus.
He has done well in (better quality) and has done better in the work of biting and has preserved this quality for the game.
Picked up three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back in the game.
Byron Buxton's central host opened the inning with a doppelganger on the left side of the field.
The Wrightfield Aaron Hicks, who made a bank, took first base, and the second Beysman Brian Dozeer got a strike out on Simon's head before he was taken over by the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked across Moer, the only player on the road who had ever been named after Miguel Sano, who beat a two-year-old single to the left of the right-hand man Drew Verhagen.
A couple of wounded were not in the car and compared to the wound on the second base of Verhagen managed to bring Baysman Trevor Pluff to the double.
It was the 27th time for the top league lead player this season when Pluff hit the ball on the double.
After Detroit added an insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI "devil" in space between the outfielders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" by Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth set.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured before the game itself, missing more than a month due to inflammation of the explanatory notes.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but as the game develops, I've become more comfortable and so I've managed to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first beatter reached first base, Hughes dropped off a single to the second baseball player, Ian Kinsler.
The walk in two Wrightfielders, J.D. Martinez, was taken out by Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first shot in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with the wounded in the lead position.
The third-base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single, another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get close to third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the account in the second inning, receiving a single-car double from James McCann's executioner and a two-car single by Anthony Goose, and what became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very well, but he got to the point.
Hughes, whose brooches were considered to have been thrown into unmarked third innings, was replaced by the right-hand revolver A.J. Ahter.
Hughes was charged with three wounds to six hits and four strike-outs.
NOTE: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal Sánchez has left the players in connection with the right shoulder stretch.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a surgery on Sanchez' shoulders in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, it is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, Pitcher-Left Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatized men and leave against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four startups since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left pitcher on 30 July, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in the games since 20 August due to the stretching of the hair muscle.
Tigers and Twins will finish a three-game series on Target Field Wednesday.
Opposing Norris (2-2, ERA 4,43) will be played by the Spitzer-Right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4,73).
The original of Kadirov's complaint according to the Book of Prayer to God came to the Southern Sakhalin Court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal by the representative of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book “Pray to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam” with reference to the President of Gordo Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting any objections from the participants.
The scoundrel refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the FP State on the need to check the Gordo for possible cooperation with foreign special forces and IGIL.
He said, "Throw it on your own," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sakhalin City Procurator ' s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko ' s decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
From the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, South Sakhalinska came an appeal Friday evening.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor ' s Office considers that they have asked the court to accept the author ' s opinion only as extremist rather than as an ayah from the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the judge took the wrong decision," Chuhrai reported.
The decision on the recognition of the book “extremist material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
For instance, "Extremists" were called quotations from the Qur'an, "We worship you and ask you for help," "Do not call anyone with Allah."
Cadyrov named the decision-makers after the book "Shitani and provocateurs".
He called on the members of the State to prohibit judicial decisions concerning texts of sacred writings by law.
“I firmly believe that the State should adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions concerning directly the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
The Facebook officers intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints on the illegal content.
The management of Facebook is committed to combating xenophobia and racism in cooperation with the German Ministry of Justice.
The head of Hyko Maas, for example, said that he was currently working with socialists to establish a special group of moderators.
Its participants are required to monitor and remove inappropriate comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Hyko Maas, the authors of intolerant posts are expected to receive notices indicating the reason for their removal.
Organizations whose experts collect hundreds of complaints about offensive posts from users should also assist in the operational blocking of the illegal content.
The Facebook Manual intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The removal of posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was decided after the German Facebook segment had dramatically increased its xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious causes for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which affected the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the locations for refugee accommodation have already been filled.
Before that, the country had decided to place migrants temporarily in the territory of former Buchenwald Councillor.
Forced settlers from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks containing prisoners and prisoners of war under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones at Moscow cemeteryes.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will provide specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first ones will be Boutovsky, Domodedovsky, and Scherbinski Cemetery.
The first psychological rest zone has already emerged at the Troekur Cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will continue to appear in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, head of the State Budget Institution Ritual, described the portal m24.ru.
Relaxation zones will be represented by small green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that in such angles, cemetery visitors will be able to rest, stay alone, and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsk, Butovsk and Šerbín cemeteryes and elsewhere in the capital.
According to HBU chapter Ritual, if there is a need to expand the cemetery area, the builders will try to keep the existing forest masses as large as possible.
Green plants will serve as a living barrier that will divide the rest areas and areas directly under burial sites.
The experts of HBU Ritual also announced their intention to propose a waiver of the buildings at the burial sites.
New cemeteries can indeed become colourless.
In addition, in the Ritual HBU, there was a willingness to set up electronic terminals with which visitors would be able to learn GPS coordinates and registration marks.
In June this year, the Ritual HBU also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services according to the time of the year.
Thus, the grave’s rhythm in summertime will stand for a thousand rubles a week in winter, when the earth freezes.
Note that during the last year, an average of 10 per cent of the rates for all kinds of ritual services were spent.
Five days later, an erratic mushroom was found in the deer forests.
An elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without commission.
A joint effort by rescuers and volunteers has led to the discovery of the mountain cemetery.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest.
No food, no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even kinologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was discovered after the helicopter had joined the search engine.
On that day Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to get drunks and coasts, but he did not return by nightfall.
The family immediately sought help, and some 30 people were raised the next day to search for a mushroom.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for five days.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "Verolet was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, completely somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
He was miraculously alive.
The mushroom was taken to a helms-based central district hospital, unconsciously, in a very difficult state.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia and severe dehydration and cooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to survive five days in the forest, doctors do not know.
Valentina Nepsa, head of the Helinian CRB therapeutic unit: "Requirement of the patient, treatment has been appointed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitali Aleksandrovich comes to Smolenstina from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that Grandpa used to pick mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, said, "The forest is not far from the road, it's not really local."
He literally came to visit his family for a few years.
Well, I went after the mushrooms.
I guess I went far and lost my mind.
With the beginning of the fungal season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
Only in the last few days have five similar cases.
Rescuers remind us that in the forest we need to walk in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that it can then be returned.
The emergency An-2 sat on average in a brother's taiga.
Right on average, they're in Siberia on an emergency Ann-2.
Enicey, a red-lined aircraft, landed on an emergency plane 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself received significant damage upon landing.
Ann-2 made the official flight.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the second pilot and the shipmaster, reports Interfax.
The accident aircraft was flown on the route of the Iron River-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Procurator ' s Office began verification of flight safety legislation after the landing of An-2.
An investigation team of the East Siberia Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed its aircraft with passengers due to technical failure on an abandoned cargo airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics refused the liner, but the crew did not make it possible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers aboard the aircraft.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
News of the Economist ? Nobel laureate: globalization
The process of globalization had to contribute to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the income gap in the developing economies is increasing, on the contrary.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to chief researcher at the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the U.S. U.S.E., Nobel Prize laureate for the 2007 economy, Eric Maskin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization stakeholders have projected great benefits for developing economies.
“And these forecasts have come to a great deal,” emphasized Maskin.
For example, China and India have seen a serious per capita growth in GDP.
But not everything is so happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “the poor” and “the poor” in poor countries, which was reflected in high income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequalities in Developing Economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by NEE.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that shows why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, reminds US NOT.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin sets out four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for poor people.
After globalization, experts from poor countries lack the skills to work with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if the P-level workers from poor countries are making their wages rise due to cooperation with the rich B staff, then the D-level workers are not feeling or their wages are falling altogether.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, a resident professor at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the NIU-ALL Department of Mathematics.
And as every powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, but companies do not have the advantage of paying for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NCAs and private funds can play a significant role in such a situation, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the globalization process, which has produced and produced results in the growth of GDP in countries.
Derbent: Lifetime.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, marks its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the festival of celebrations, the festival of national cultures of Dagestane and the fair in the past, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, the historic and musical show “2000 Years in Two Hours” and the tours to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of Narin Kala Fortress, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow passages and the palace gardens -- all of this came from the pages "Tires and One Night".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved since ancient times.
Although it was claimed to be by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Hazar Caganate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of Eastern platan, which grows in the yard of the Derbent Juma mosque, is the same as for several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the "Derevja - Monuments of Nature" programme.
The shadow of the scattered crown saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The mosque's visitor will be served with flavored tea, and will be served with Dagestan's treats - honeydish engineer, hurma, musmula, miracle glues, Iran, and sweets.
During the centuries, Derbent has been using large self - repairs to make tea for many guests.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was built in 115 years of hijra.
I mean, in 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in size and solemnity: the archades of domes and vaults rely on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from the tiny windows.
The content and development of pigeons is the traditional involvement of the inhabitants of Derbent.
The owners of domestic birds put pigeons in their backyards, under trees, in their attics.
A fascinating sight is the take-off in the sky of white pigeons like the flashes of a holiday fireworks.
To defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
As we walked 500 meters to the sea, this facility shut down Derbent's harbor.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were included in UNESCO's World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of ancient pertification.
The carpets in Derbent were woven back in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the nearby streets, carpets are sold for any taste, such as fur, cotton or wool, all the colors and shades, with or without the vortex, with the complex ornaments and the curious cinnamon.
The construction of the city began with a malova block with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the long years, the avalanche has hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls, and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval city but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the Persian - built water supply were preserved about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources have come in which locals are still gathering water.
Many derbents prefer conventional tap water from proven historical fountains.
Derbent had one of the potter's centres.
The cisterns, the vases, the dishes, the kitchens, the cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The potter's hands are still making amazing ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
During the festivals and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope on which students of the Republican school of circus art perform.
The history of amazing and risky skill spans several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly visible among canoeers.
There is a museum called Culture and the House of the Ancient Derbent in the former Virgin Bath.
In the past, single girls and brides were washed and accompanied by friends, and now anyone who wants to see a pool hall, a hot and cold swimming pool that has left for bathing.
In most homes, Derbent has hot water, but baths and steamers are as popular today as they were in the past.
The benefits of warming the body are described in the old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility, and ease.
The Commonwealth festival, which is held in Narin Kal Fortress, is attended by ethno courts in many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform the songs of the Caucasus people and entertain visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlar is the site of the burial of forty martyrs who have put their heads behind Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for Northern Caucasus Muslims.
Greedy sarcophagus has been cut out of stone blocks from time to time and directed, as the Arabs have adopted, along the axis of the west-east.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and burdened customers in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The Parishmare has been there for many years.
Circular craftsmanship is passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yaqub brothers can make not only traditional hairstyles but also modern hairstyles.
On one of the streets of Old Town, there was a house where there lived a decabrist writer named Alexander Bestužev-Marlinsky, sent to the Caucasus.
Having studied the Turkish language and gathered ethnographic material, he described Derbent, the first third of the 19th century, with his ancient monuments, his life and his household as citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional East Club, where only tea and home cooking are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, communicate with their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in past times, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of teapots.
The Derbent dancing ensemble, Kaspy, was established three years ago, but has already been able to participate in the activities of the republican and Russian levels.
The soloists rehearse every day, teaching perfection the folk's faults, the Dargins, the tats, the Armenian dances.
With the arrival of the evening, when noise breaks out and street lights are lit, locals are stationed on benches near houses with speaking terraces.
Derbents generally discuss domestic issues.
But in front of the anniversary, they increasingly remember the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the Black Sea and Caspian region as a whole.
Domodedov had a business game at the airport.
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students tried being airport staff.
To that end, three aircraft models were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only looked after and registered the passengers but also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but the complexity of the game has not given way.
Delayed flights, two passengers with crashes on board, lost their traps somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the real airport, hell.
For the reason given at Domodedov's hangar, there is a standard set of tasks to be addressed to the newcomers.
Three large airports from different parts of the world were placed in one hangar.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of air carriers.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage traffic, even the passengers were entrusted by buses in the field, lanes and passengers' inspection.
And the passengers are very troubled.
One of the problems with the documents, the other one late on the flight, and the third one filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to deal with all of this, as in life, within a minimum period of time.
Each of these tasks is subject to a certain amount of money, virtual money, as if the airline had paid the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
“They are fined for failure,” explains a financial analyst in the News Moscow programme, Dmitri Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education closely follow the developments.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
She has already been enrolled in secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional centres of competence that will, in fact, become new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” says the director of the Department of Public Policy in the area of training of workers and additional vocational training of the Russian Federation, Natal Zolotareva.
That's why students don't go to global plans.
After three days of training, they may need a weekend off.
However, the estimates for this examination were quite tangible.
The new smart-eyes, the best I've ever seen!
“I received them for responding to our Instagram airport in a timely manner,” said Sergei Shuvalov, a pier manager of the Airport Frankfurt team.
The best judges, which is called, were put on a standoff to invite themselves to work by the time the study was completed.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre for Foreign Literature at the Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy Centre at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken recently by the RF have questioned Russia’s commitment to relations between Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments of the long history of our countries’ relations,” said Ambassador John Tefft of the United States, in his statement at Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre for American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a meeting place with numerous American eminent persons, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year did the American Centre have more than 400 cultural and educational events and more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Education Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was soon to be brought to justice.
Typical situation: The four officials are at the table of Judge Swattan Kumar, hearing his claims for the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to rejoice over it, says Kumar.
If another brick is laid, we will order all available buildings to be demolished.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT) - a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, along with the steep economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to address more than 10,000 air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: India has become one of the world's most populous and polluted countries in the 60 years since the declaration of the independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development is slow for rapid urbanization: cities covered with heavy strength, rivers filled with pesticides and wastes of enterprises and households, and few of the remaining residential areas are cut off in new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main cause of the abolition of major investment projects.
In May this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court decisions “extremal” and “implementable”.
Sometimes decisions of the court are indeed impossible to implement within the time limit set by the court, according to environmental counsel Raj Pandjani.
However, the unfulfilled blankets are also positive: at least they force the responsible to move.
"His main goal is to crack this system," adds a lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly abolished major structures: in its account, the cessation of airport construction, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People, for example, are trying to remember the fate of the pharmaceutical company in Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," he commented on Kumar's decision.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by the common people whose lives can change because of a single chapter of the judge’s pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital before causing public outrage.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Svatenter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Delhi statistics on the entry and departure of vehicles, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned from factories whether they were in a position to comply with such an order.
As pollution sources, such as landfills, fuel quality, and even road accidents began to get the attention of the court, people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful theme of the principal judge was the Ganges River Cleanup Program, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, which is sacred to Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and starts screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of the Ganges into the image of God, and there were feces in it, and the judge was hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Gang is Gang, he'll take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The clean-up of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project, annotated by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds more than 120 times.
Every year between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindu bathers die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Maudie even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund from selling his suit, where he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists also accused the Prime Minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000 while the river needs at least eight billion to clean.
The Green Tribunal's supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress must be green.
“In a developing country, environmental talks are often seen as an inadvertent luxury,” said Malik Bhanot, an activist of Call Ganga.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between environment and development."
The man shed blood on several paintings of Dali at the exhibition in Riga.

Si Jin calls for the economy to be more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, President Si Jingin said on Tuesday in addressing the group facing the challenge of reform.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing policies of openness”, he said, addressing participants in the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Lead Group on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reform.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy a new momentum and life force and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the revision of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased in through pilot programmes.
