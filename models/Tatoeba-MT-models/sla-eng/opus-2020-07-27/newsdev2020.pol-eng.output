Bosniaks protest Croatia's landfill plans
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-west Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store parts of waste from the only nuclear power plant region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
The protestors in Bosniak town of Novi Grad requested Croatia to charge plans to build a landfill in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declare a fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosniaks holding banners with the inscriptions “I want a healthy future” and “Stop – (river) Una needs us” said that the landfill of radioactive waste could endanger the Union's rivers and the lives of some 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO,
told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, Mayor of Novi Grad municipality.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
The Krško power plant, located in Slovenia, was built in the 1980s and belongs to Croatia.
Representatives of both countries are expected to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT stated on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build a waste dump on its own or to pay for the storage of parts of waste in a new Slovenian building.
Croatia's Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia activists, officials and residents from each side of the country's ethnic divide have insisted that Croatia find another location in a part of the country near the power plant.
"Why does Croatia in all of its territory claim that the Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?" Drljaca asked.
We can't be humiliated!

The American Congress has agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The U.S. Congress, by statutory 15 days after the Department of State's approval of possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-tasking F-35 fighters, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approving the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Defense Policy Adviser of the Washington-based conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned arms sales abroad for 15 days before the signing of the agreement, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to a NATO member country, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalised – will be the American arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of F-35A engines Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of U.S. fighters for the fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of this year during President Andrzej Dudy's meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.
The implementation of this Agreement, if finalised, will be guarded by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sale Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one F-35 hunter at the time of Poland's tendering was – without arms and technical assistance – about 89.2 million dollars.
As the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed the PAP, the price presented in the initial negotiations was "at a maximum, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices are falling rapidly, the price of one F-35 is now below 80 million dollars, much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the benefits F-35 has," said Venable.
PAP speakers hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of US fighter aircraft by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – offset – will be discussed directly with US F-35 hunters.
What is Münchhausen's replacement team, as referred to in Payton Hobart's Choices on Netflix?
Caregivers and parents with the above disorder pretend that their healthy child is sick.
Payton Hobart's Choices is scheduled for Netflix today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first he has to become chairman of the student board at his secondary school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, the creators of American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, it addresses the subject of the replacement Münchhausen syndrome – a mental illness occurring in caregivers who are acting as if the healthy person they are dealing with has been affected by physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. Münchhausen syndrome, which causes symptoms of the disease.
Münchhausen's replacement team is to simulate that the person under our care has some problems.
It is also called an imaginary disease, and is regarded as violence against the child.
This is a rare condition, which usually involves the parent who experiences symptoms or causes symptoms, so it would appear that his child is ill.
What are the signs of Münchhausen's replacement team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS draws attention to the following examples of behaviour:
Persuading medical personnel that a healthy child does not feel well.
Exacerbation or developing symptoms.
Forgery results for the child to be considered sick, e.g. administration of glucose to urine samples to make it appear that the child has diabetes.
Cause symptoms of the disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often is Munchhausen's replacement team?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, as many cases of disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 shows that over two years there have been 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people.
What should be done if there is suspicion that a child may be in danger?
You should contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC Child Protection Informationline by selecting number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid on Kaduna school, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – State Police Station in Kadun conducted an attack on Imamu Ahmad Bn Hambal school yesterday, located in Layin Maidubun Tsuma, Rigasa, self-government district of Igabi, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said the children were in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities deny the claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a school preacher, said: “They don’t tell the truth, because all the children were there according to parental consent.
Before accepting the children to school, the parents signed the form.
Every day, parents brought food to their children and knew the conditions they were under.
We were very surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of all the student food provided by the parents before the school closed.
It's not right, because parents can confirm that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of Abdurrahman Police, who once visited school to check the level of childcare, never had any objections.
He claimed that the children studied the Koran and nothing else.
However, a specialist at the Public Relations Police Department, Yakubu Sabo, thought that they would join their parents after transferring the status of children to the government.
‘They have been kept under dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of indigenous knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That's why we're studying school to meet her owner," he added.
Foreign talents important to China’s development
Guangdong is the leader in the country in terms of attracting foreign talent largely due to the Pass and Train Initiative (BRI), the Grand Gulf Area (GBA) of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao and the new role of Shenzhen as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group conducted interviews in Guangdong with seven expatriates aged 10 to 70.
From Singapore, Yash, born in 2010 during the Asian games in Guangzhou, said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and doing a PhD in Guangzhou.
Nikita Nikandrow, a Russian-Chinese student at Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, said: "Thanks to the BRI initiative, Russian students can study together with Chinese students.
We can work together to create new concepts and new projects.
Rachel Rommeswinkel, from the United States, started a career in Dongguan as a beauty blogger and has over a million fans in Bilbili and Weibo.
She said she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology in her videos.
Leticia de Lassus of France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that “children’s education is like sticking a jacket.
If you turn the first button wrong, the rest will never get to their proper place.
An American of Chinese origin, Henry Xiao, believes that in the very centre of the GBA area, his company can enjoy many privileges with regard to new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talent.
The manufacturer of “Nanta Show” Sean Choi from South Korea said that Guangdong's kitchen is known worldwide and the introduction of “Nanta Show” in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Moleer of Switzerland, acting as Technical Director for Quality in Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high quality is planted in the proper performance of simple works.
To his surprise, many talented young people in China like to work, learn to make good products, and strive for better results.
Report: Poles want a banasian dismission
The majority of Poles want the division of the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Mariana Banasia – according to the study Kantar for TVN.
In the opinion of the chief of NIK Marian Banas, 55% replied "yes" – including 34% marked the option "yes" and 21% "yes".
The answer “I don’t know/hard to say” was chosen by 26% of the respondents, while 19% – 8% said “no” and 11% said “no”.
Mariana Banasia’s demand for dissipation arose after the release of the story “Pancerny Marian and Hotel for Hours” in the program “Supervisioner”.
It appears from the material that the NICI chief was in possession of a building in Cracow, in which the hotel operated for hours, and the gangsters who ran it were to rent a stone at a price below the market price.
After disclosure of the material, Banas announced that on 27 September he would be able to make a free leave until the end of the control of his CBA property claims.
The Kantar telephone survey was carried out on 25 and 26 September 2019 at a nationwide representative sample of 1005 people over the age of 18 years.
The possible measurement error is 3 percentage points.

Simoniak: Tusk or Kidava-Błońska will be president
"I note that Donald Tusk and Margaret Kidada-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," he said.
Deputy Chief of the Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak spoke to Polsat News about the affair with the NI chief.
"This case is disqualified for Marian Banasia.
He can become a minister of culture on some entertainment matters, not the head of NIK, or the minister of finance.
Not someone responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke of Claudia Jachira's candidate.
“Antoni Matierewicz is on the list of PiS.
A man who not only said things but did them.
He judged former SKW chiefs for spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone call for Antony Macierevitch not to be on the lists?" he asked.
"The younger people have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who's already apologized for one thing, feels she's exaggerating sometimes.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

"A dazzling" masked rapist of Central Coast children forced to look at their victim in court
Dressed in a masked man grabbed a 12-year-old boy from behind and dragged her into dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after his arrest, a search warrant was issued in his home, where officers detained a number of relevant subjects.
The man pleaded guilty to seven assault charges and to three other charges concerning the infatuation and sexual use of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was on the trail, and when she looked behind her, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged “stop, stop, stop, ” he grabbed her by the neck and forced her into an adult.
The man said: “Quiet, don’t shout.
Don't shout, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable belts and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut it off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9:30, not responding to a few texts and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and he wore traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed to be involved in an attack of rage on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the embankment.
A further trial will take place on Tuesday.
The pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of achievement in the digital field posed a risk of increasing social inequalities if, in terms of ethics, the good of the common one was not taken into account.
Pope Francis spoke these words during a conference in Vatican City, attended by representatives of governments, Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physics and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the perspectives and threats related to artificial intelligence.
The technological achievements of war art and the future of work have been discussed, which will lead to more and more machine roles, as well as a study of the case of the Christmas attack in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies that own social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution have saved workers dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on work equipment in order to achieve profits was a risk of depriving people of their dignity as a result of their work.
"If technological progress were to be the cause of more and more visible inequalities, this would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind would become an enemy of the good in common, it would lead to an unwanted return to some kind of barbarism driven by the strongest laws.
Conference organizers expressed hope to benefit from the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technology.
Martin Odegaard, a contender borrowed from the Real Madrid, puts fans into euphoria with his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Michael Oyarzabal.
Winning 2:0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid climbed to the top of the La League table and continues to pass unbeatable on its own field in this year's season.
However, despite the incalculable failure of this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, there is enormous pressure from the turbulent pre-season and public confrontation with the Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a turning point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the League of Masters by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – some of them the French currently have plans, and others do not.
Vinícius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of real Madrid and is currently playing in the team.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, caused a great deal of movement, including an incredible assistant in the La League game.
During the meeting Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Michael Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3-0 before his own audience.
After taking the ball off the right side, Martin Odegaard maneuvered the player from the opposite team, setting him up with a net, and then sent an amazing shot to the centimetres between two other players and his teammate just to deliver the leg.
Willian Jose's second goal and third in the execution of the incredible Oyarzabal, this time with the punishment, secured a decisive victory for Imanol's security before Manu Garcia was sent out of the field five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard only joined the Real Madrid as 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulties trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, a Norwegian footballer finally seems to be on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pawar's name on the fraud of the Maharastra State Bank
Anna Hazare stated: “The name of Sharad Pawar was not visible on the list when the case was handed over to me.”
Social worker Anna Hazare was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pawar, the chairman of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with the multimillion-dollar fraud in the State Bank of Maharashtra.
In short, the Executive Director’s investigation agency, ED, brought a case against Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar, the former Deputy Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra, and others in connection with fraud.
The information report of the Executive Director on the case, equivalent to the police report of the FIR, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on the report of the Mumbai Police FIR, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajita Pawara, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When the case came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar was not visible anywhere.
"How his name came up, who gave it, only they know these things," Anna Hazare said on Thursday, when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged links between charade pawar and fraud.
Anna Hazare, a critical judge of Sharad Pawar, expressed the hope that the truth would come out as a result of a detailed investigation into fraud by ED.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption event.
Sharad Pawar denies the admission of a criminal act and claims that he was not connected in any way with the bank, and also raises questions about the fact that the case was filed several weeks before the October 21st Assembly elections in Maharashte.
The former Minister of the Union has ensured that he will not give in to the property of Delhi, clearly referring to the central government led by the BJP.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Director as motivated by political considerations.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million under the EpiPen settlement
Mylan has agreed to pay $30 million in the absence of a notification by investors of the investigation by the Justice Department of a possible demand for too high an amount in the Medicaid programme for EpiPen.
On Friday, the Securities Commission and the Stock Exchange stated that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen as a "generic" medicine in the Medicaid payback programme.

In its Friday statement, the company found that it did not confirm or deny KPWIG’s claims.
Is this the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, severe illness, death of a child.
They're dramas that cause a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We ask, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God wanted us to."
Is it the Creator who sends us misery and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father ran out of the room with fear.
"My son has no arms or legs!" he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujic is a world-famous evangelist and motivational speaker, bringing many people back.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," said Nick.
"When suffering touches us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask: "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God rules the whole world and directs our lives, the question naturally arises whether He has sent us a disease, a calamity...".

Mr Po Krzysztof Brejz sues Caesar's Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of lies of the literary TV, I appear with a lawsuit against Caesar's Gmyz," said Mr Po Krzysztof Brejz on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement by the publicist Caesar Gmyz in the program “Last 20” on the TVP antenna.
One of the leading leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has great experience in organizing the hate department.
"People who know Maryz Kozak-Zagozad – founders of the 'Hyterski' profile – are Kirwiński, Budka and Gierty," said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka is a party and social profile with memes and political jokes.
As the "Networks" put it, the PR player, Mariusz Kozak-Westa, is behind the profile on this title.
"We have learned that since April Mariusz Kozak-Zagoda has been employed at Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office," wrote a week.
"Confederation" in Olav
At the Olav fair, the election committee “Confederation” organized its meeting.
The program was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski number 5 on the list, and Halszka Bielecka number 9.
An unanimated leader of the list Krzysztof Tuduj did not reach the election council.
Candidates have raised many problems – from excessive fiscalism to health problems.
The issue of the economic zone, which should work for all entrepreneurs, was also addressed, not favouring foreign capital.
Climate strike in Budapest – World

It was said: “What do we want?
Climate protection!
When do we want it?
Now!"
Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with businessman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Police Office will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation into the prime minister of the investigation whether, during the conduct of the public office as mayor of London, he has committed a criminal offence.
The Council of the Great London (GLA) stated that its Supervisory Inspector had registered a ‘concerning issue’ of the Prime Minister in connection with the allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from the merging of their intimate knowledge.
"The question of "proceeding" can be mentioned when information appears indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
Doesn't mean it's somehow proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine the case.
The issue is addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
It was transferred to this police supervisor because Johnson was then the same police commissioner and criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
Earlier, he said that he would follow the London City Council's orders and give details of his relations with Arcuri, but insisted that the Council "focused on the wrong problem".
The warrant follows a report by The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received $126,000 of budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, headed by Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 for Arcuri-based Hacker House until the hearing.
The government is looking forward to challenging questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the allocation of funds.
Minister of Digitalization Matt Warman said in the Chamber of the General that the employees of his department "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the number has been redirected to the California office, where Arcuri is now 34-year-old.
A close relationship between the prime minister and the businessman "was a secret policymaker for the staff".
The decision to refer the matter to the Prime Minister to the independent IOPC Police Office was dissatisfactioned at 10 Downing Street.
According to a higher-ranking source, the government's representative is "so politically motivated", and its deadline, on the eve of the Conservation Party's conference, is "publicly political".
"The Supervisor did not provide any evidence of the charges and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to reply before the publication of the press release late Friday night," the source claims.
Neither the citizens nor the media will be able to acquire a political code that is so obvious.
In earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businessman, assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was a "policinella secret" for employees.
The employees of the London & Partners (L&P) agency were more placed to remind them that Arcuri received seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her company was not then considered "trustworthy".
Third accused of drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – Due to last year's death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to the court records, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone-treated pills that Miller had in his possession prior to his death last September as a result of accidental cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl overdoses, a strong opioid responsible for the “epidia” that claimed several thousand human existences in the United States.
Walter's being charged with delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed Tuesday reveal that Pettit was receiving drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of being Walter's "courier" who supplied the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly charged with causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in their case.
Walter, subject to parole for the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months for violating the conditions of release.
Prosecutors in charge of a case reported on Thursday as the first on the TMZ celebrity website are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escaping the accused.
The reply to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come straightaway.
Pettit was charged with federal proceedings on September 4th, and his attorney refused to comment.
The words of the rhymed compositions of Miller are a frank conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was really Malcolm James Myers McCormick, stayed in touch for two years with the singer Ariana Grande, who had finished in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film with Miller and the song “Thank U Next, ” in which she spoke of him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to the abuse of opioids.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of an overdose in 2016, and his body identified the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article amends: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games on mobile devices
The 9-year-old creates a game of hide-and-seek games using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
There's a bat in today's game that's hiding according to the program.
The player wins the point every time he catches a bat that comes out of the hideout.
I learned how to create games at a fast pace.
"Now I create them when I am bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad enrolled him on a five-day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was designed to provide children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," CNN's father said.
But Basil’s interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and received a storm for spending all his time playing games.
"One day he played on the board as usual, and he was so absorbed that I got nervous," the father said.
Out of anger, I said, "You're always playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play them?"
When I said those words, I was nervous, and I didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, urging parents to buy a laptop and record it on a course during which he learned the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thunder of titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest number of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were praised for using codes to create robots that divide their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghana High School of Women won the Robofest 2019 contest for programming robots for boxing.
And thanks to growing investments by technology giants like Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on a good path to a star-coded career.
Former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina confesses to a lie on corruption
On Friday, the trial documents show that the former President of the Republic Party in North Carolina admits in court that he has lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to the Walker, Robin Hayes is about to plead guilty next Wednesday.
A document containing the factual basis prepared in the framework of the defence agreement and signed by lawyer Hayes shows that Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence counsel's agreement has been sealed, and the basis does not give rise to the charges that Hayes has been charged with.
Initially, he was accused of conspiracy, corruption and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in an insurance company's plan to direct taxes to the main country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
The Director of Greg Lindberg and his two associates were accused of attempting to bribe Mike Causey's State Insurance Commissioner.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, one of the main state donors in recent years, which has transferred more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He was mainly in favour of the Republican Party's objectives and policies, but he also gave money to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's e-mail requesting a comment.
The defender of Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's e-mail requesting a comment.
According to the court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about the state employees of the Insurance Department.
According to a factual basis document, Hayes actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's request for changes in staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberger arrange a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about a bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to Causey's renewed campaign in 2020.
It follows from the indictment that the conspiracy also requires the amendment of the department official who controlled Lindberg.
The former Republican Causey reported an alleged attempt to corrupt federal agents and helped them collect evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to the indictment, the partner of Lindberge ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causey campaign, during which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such amount of money would attract attention, but the indictment finally dropped.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do" – according to the indictment, Hayes said.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to an e-mail requesting further information on the settlement.
Drivers will go to the first section of the new burial site
On Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first of the three built mountain sections of the S7 express road, which is the new Zakopyanka – from Komymeljna White to Rabka Source and then the two-way road to Chabówka.
As Iwona Mikrut, the spokesman of the Directorate-General for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA), said on Friday, this is the first of three sections of the S7 building south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabki Zdru, which will be delivered to us.

From the next node, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 towards New Fair and Buried and on DK7 to Chyzyny and the state border with Slovakia.
A MOP passenger service was established on Zbitecká Gora.
The expressway ends with the Zabornia node in Rabka Zdrovje, which was built about a kilometre-long biroad fragment of DK47 to Chabówka and is included there in the already existing two-way Chabówka-Rdzawka.
The S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Zdrój section and the new section of the national road no. 47 class of the main accelerated (GP) from Rabka Source to Chabówka was built by Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment was around PLN 615 million.
The quality assurance of the work carried out will be valid for 10 years.
The 16.7 km section of the new Zakopyanka, including 15.8 km with expressway parameters, was divided into three realization sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubien – Repair, Repair – Komielna Biała and Skomielna Biała – Rabka Zdró.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by Polish – Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, tunnel section – Italian company Astaldi and third – Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is close to PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union's Wednesdays under the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is more than PLN 1.3 billion.
On this whole section, there are 38 engineering facilities (bridges, bridges, estacades) and a two-room tunnel of 2.06 km.
According to the announcement, road manager will be available this year with a 7.6-km section of Lubien – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7 which drivers will avoid building the tunnel.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna White with a length of about 3 km, drivers will go in 2021, after the completion of the two-room tunnel with each thread length of about 2.06 km.
Our goal is a state of prosperity
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," said Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to get a vote on the councillor, Dariusz Matecki, who is running for Sejm from the list of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the state of well-being," the Minister said.
"We want the Poles to make much better money to make their lives on a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to.
Our government, for four years, has consistently implemented a program that he committed to carrying out four years ago.
We said we'd run the 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it was impossible that this money just didn't exist.
We proved that money was and was, only PO didn't care about the ones they were supposed to hit."
Ziobro also reminded of the Child Retirement and Thirteenth Retirement – and that a 14th pension is also planned.
In addition to the "deployment of national income", the priorities of the PIS are a just state and economic development.
Money should not be a great source only in the pocket of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should go evenly to the whole of society," the politician said.
Emmanuel Macron pays tribute to Jacques Chirac
The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, said goodbye to his predecessor Jacques Chirac on Thursday; he called him the great Frenchman and the great husband of the state.

Sopotska Street in Nisko is already under construction
On Tuesday, 24 September, it was dedicated to the operation of the expanded Sopocka street in Nisko.
The total value of this task amounted to PLN 1 million, of which PLN 16,000 was funded by the FDS, while the remaining amount was the own contribution from the Nizanski District and the Municipality and the City of Nisko.
Thanks to the funds obtained, it was possible, among other things, to make a surface of 1,284 metres long with its extension, a sidewalk of 950 meters, dehydration, and finishing work.
The investment was carried out by the Company Consortium: PBI Infrastructure S.A. from Krasnik and PBI WMB Sp. z o.o. from Sandomier.
At the turn of the year 2019/2020, the lower district will carry out the further development of Sopocco Street, within which a new surface will be made, a sidewalk and a bridge on the Barczeka River will be rebuilt.

Facebook with self-awareness of users hides the taste counter
As part of the world's first experiment, aimed at improving users' self-esteem, some users of Facebook will soon be unable to see their favorites, reactions and videos.
The likenesses will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
A new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a self-esteem study and an opinion from mental health experts indicating that a fan counter could lead to comparison with others.
"The clothing from the many groups working with us to combat harassment, as well as the mental health organisation, was really positive," Garlick said.
The elimination of this counter will help people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more pleasant and will not be taken as a competition – she said.
Garlick ensured that companies based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test included Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made permanently.
"The initial user comments on the new rules in force on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking about the site of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically notorious Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with good opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable to people using our services or not.
FAQ: Councillors want compensation from curia for pilgrims
Czestochowska kura does not yet comment on the appeal of the Advisory Council to the local metropolis abpa Wacława Depo on the transfer of financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city claims 1 zł from the pilgrim.
On Friday, he spoke at a press conference, attended by the leader of Spring Robert Biedron, organized to lead the Jasna Všechové mountain of the Most Holy Mary of the Virgin, vice-president of the town council and candidate for Sejmu Lukasz Kot.
Kot reported that the day before, the local councillors of the SLD had voted to appeal to Abpa Wacława Depo for the transfer of a city of gold from every visitor to Czestochowa Pilgrim – to support the work of city services, municipal services, etc.
We received an appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up after pilgrims, prepare the city for pilgrims.
"We ask for the transfer to the budget of the city of symbolic gold from each pilgrim.
This will enable the city to provide them with better conditions of stay in Czestochowa," the city council vice-president said.
Asked for a comment by the spokesman for the Czech Metropolitan Courier, Fr. Mariusz Bakalarz initially prepared a number of answers, but then asked – as he signalled – to replace it with the content: “We do not refer to the case until the official position of the City Council is reached”.
According to a project posted on the pages of the Czestochowa Magistrate, the appeal to abpa Depo refers to the “transfer of financial compensation to the city of Czestochowa for the service of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season”.
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Czestochowa and the increasing costs of operating municipal waste management during the pilgrimage season, given the image of the city among residents, Fridays and Fridays, we would like to propose, within the framework of the generally accepted cannons of care for our common good, the small country of Czestochowa, participation in the costs of operating the waste system," sounds a fragment of the appeal.
"In order to maintain the cleanliness of pedestrian trains, which are moved by pilgrims, using a small infrastructure, i.e. outer baskets for waste, we present the proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from pilgrims", it is written.
"In addition to the participation in the annual costs which the city will cover from its own resources, ensuring the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and stressing that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of public toilets available to the public," the Council said.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial matters, their proposal stems from the numerous objections raised by residents to the state of purity of the routes to which pilgrims move.
"Having in mind the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Czestochowa City Council calls for the archbishop of Czestochowa Vecława Depo to provide financial compensation for the city of Czestochowa for the service of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," the appeal reiterated.
According to the press office of Jasna Gora, 834 thousand attended in 200 general Polish pilgrims throughout the year.
About 124 thousand faithful came in 255 pilgrims on foot.
Over 8.8 thousand people came to Czestochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 (16 groups) in race pilgrimages.
Not nearly 20 people made it to the horse sanctuary, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups — on roller skates.
“News” TVP missed the Confederation when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the election to the PiS Fair, 45% would receive votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
Even on the “Super Express” portal for which a probe was carried out, the electoral threshold has been exceeded.
In the main edition of "The Knowledge", describing the same survey, the results of only four first parties were presented, completely forgetting the Confederacy.
The leader, Edita Lewandowska, made it clear that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
TVP also showed the distribution of fair mandates without taking into account the votes cast on the Confederation.
It would give P.S. independent governments.
Krzysztof Bosak, commenting on the whole situation, spoke of "public compromise on civil integrity".
"They started with slogans on 'the moral revolution'", he recalled and said that this matter is a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "The news of TVP" is embarrassing urban and Michnik in further actions against the Confederate".
He also drew attention to the lack of right-wing journalists.
"But let's also look at those who are politely silent.
Those "right," "independent", "unruly".
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they fought with," he added.
Małgorzata Motylow Vice President of NIK
On Thursday 26 September, the Marshals of Sejmu Elżbieta Witek handed over the act of appointing Małgorzata Motylow as Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Chamber on 27 September 2019.
"In accordance with Article 21(1) of the Law on the Supreme Chamber of Vice-Presidents' Control, the NICU shall call and call upon the Marshal of the Sejm, after consulting the relevant fair committee, at the request of the President of the NIQ," the communication reads.
The proposal in this case came to the Sejm Marshal on 24 September 2019.
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Sejmu, it was addressed to the Fair Commission for State Control, which gave a positive opinion on 26 September", recalls the Communication.
‘So, on 26 September 2019, the NIC vice-presidents were called off: Ewa Polkowska, Wojciech Kutyła and Mieczysław Łuchak,’ said the Communication.
Earlier that day, applications for all these personal decisions were positive in favour of the State Audit Commission, since the vote on the opinion to appeal the Polish Ewa was held twice, with the same number of Members in favour and opposition in the first vote on the Commission.
The new NIK Vice President, Małgorzata Motylow, comes from Chelma Lubelski.
Brother sentenced to life for killing honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star with photos published on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty on Friday of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who won the fame by publishing bold selfies – generous according to Western standards, but in a strongly mysogenic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no remorse for his actions and stated that he had "evidently" murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "unacceptable".
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by a higher court of law," he said.
Earlier, Baloch’s mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this was my son," she said.
Baloch's murder hit the top of the world's information services and resumed calls for action against so-called honour killings, in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social rules.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for crimes such as the choice of their own husband or, as in Baloch's case, for bringing their family a “worship” through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by a close relative.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (revelation) may ask their closest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder will be considered an honorary crime remains the duty of a judge, which means that murderers can theoretically invoke another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially pressured their son not to be favored.
However, they feel that they may lose him, have changed their minds, and have declared that they want him to be guilty.
The international outrage caused by the murder led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself heir with its parents, thus forcing the matter to turn forward.
One of the more famous works of Baloch is offering to strip before Pakistan's cricket team and the establishment of a mutilated purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It has been criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, have seen it as a breaking restriction in a country where posing as Kim Kardashian can be considered a bold and political move to strengthen women's position.
The root of the "honoral" killing lies in tribal social standards that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of resettlements from Northwest Nigeria to 40 000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said that the growing violence has led to a doubling of the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to around 40,000 people in the last four months.
The UN Agency for Refugees has stated that concerns have created a "new emergency humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to raise $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic grouping of Boko Haram, which has been in the north of the country for decades, has not been responsible for recent attacks.
The rise in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organised armed groups.
"It paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders and sexual assaults on the part of attackers, who also destroy houses and stolen cattle.
Military and police were sent to fight criminal gangs in the region.
However, the military is withdrawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which emerged from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
They come for this with terrible stories.
Most refugees are joining the neighbouring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said he expected more people to run to Niger in the coming months, along with the deteriorating security situation, in particular in Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of a man accused of killing a woman and 2 children
A new trial date was planned for a man who was accused of killing Iowa's apartment and her two children from Guatemala.
The Act of the District Court in Polk states that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of the three murders of the first degree under, according to the authorities, a false name originally given to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he murdered 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.
The new date of the trial, i.e. 27 January, shows that it will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
Immigration and Customs officials say Escobar-Orellana is illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
‘The Sun: Boris Johnson in the face of the rebellion of a cabinet seeking to reduce the demands of Brix and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the EU's final summit among the most important people in the country, the prime minister is concerned that he will not have enough time to make major concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a rebellion on the part of a cabinet seeking to reduce the demands of berry and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impossion on a new customs system, which would be a substitute for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has put forward other arrangements offered by Johnson as "improvable".
The ministers of the Crown expect the EU's decision-makers, headed by the Head of Germany, Angela Merkel, to offer at the last moment a compromise to the critical leader of the Torys in the form of a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke to three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the prime minister after the annual conference of Torys next week in Manchester.
They will call on the Prime Minister to charge the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser, Dominik Cummings, for attempts to use bluffs against the EU and to threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then to accept a recent offer by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers declared the Supreme Court's cohesive verdict on Tuesday to end Parliament's suspension as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way to leave the European Union is to do so on the basis of an agreement on 31 October.
We'll never beat the arithmetic in the Chamber of the Municipals, which is acting on our inefficiencies.
The Prime Minister needs to bend down now and accept what he can get.
Aggression doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned down on the handlebar.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The Second Minister of the Cabinet has committed himself to hand Johnson over to try and push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
The minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to resubmit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Chamber. ”
There are numerous opportunities to vote, and everyone very much depends on ending this topic.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and it's the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a succinct speech, the former Tory Minister said: “The Prime Minister tells us he wants a deal with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he fights with bulls in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and fights with citizens on the main streets of the cities – all in the sight of the world, as if the electoral campaign had already lasted for good."
The current prime minister admitted yesterday that the agreement is still distant, and added: "No one should be delusional: to reach an agreement is a very long way to go."
However, the spokesman also said that Benn's law implementing a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement "has actively weakened our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister and his coworkers continue to make progress through hard work. ”
The Secretary for Brexit Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will take place with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the zone will function for all of Ireland for food and for the living.
A dog with no nose and legs under Instagram.
Perfectly impeccable.
Kundelek was supposed to be asleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal from first sight.
"At first, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of the bitch until someone adopts her.
Still no one checked in.
"The fact that no one wanted it made me want to take care of it more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Eventually, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly impeccable.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, that's his problem, not ours," the woman said.
Bonnie eventually became a star of social media.
Over 14,000 interns watch it on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a musical accent, I would never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV heads said that because of Glasgow's accent, "they will never make a career" as a presenter.
Looking back on her 35-year career in the Kelly TV industry, age 59, admits that before the first performance on the screen, she felt "great anxiety".
"I was only 25 years old and very nervous," she said.
When I worked at the BBC Scotland as a specialist in searching and checking information, the chief said that my accent from Glasgow would never succeed in television.
I went to London to get to know the entire TV-am team and watch the show before I took over the office in Glasgow.
I'll never forget an interview with a Bette Davis star by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was where I wanted to stay.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for the local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then began to run such programs as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start her morning program "Lorraine", which he called her by her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be a special program during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret to her long internship on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "excession", adding: "We have to work hard.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When mentioning the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly says that “very difficult” for her was reporting the bombing in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our live program with Dunblane the day after the horrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter, Joanna, was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for many hours at her house.
The whole meeting was held quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, where I participated.
She added that "extremely difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanni shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they also bear the worst comments online trolls.
I'm there with them with all my heart.
The program on the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will begin at 8:30 on Monday, September 30 at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
A senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the offer to take over the office of President Robert Mugabe, a non-existent, at the top point of the coup because he feared imprisonment to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
As reported last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwenge to take over the presidency during negotiations with the military in the context of the coup.
However, a senior state official said in the social media that Chiwenga had not rejected the offer out of fear, but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan, which included using it to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup d'état.
In addition to the Twitter portal, which confirmed that Zimbabwe's 37-year-old ruler wanted to hand over power to Vice-President Chiwenge and not to President Emmerson Munangagwa, Jamwanda 2, which officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior state official at the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there were intense negotiations on the matter at that time.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that the government was slipping away from his hands.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president, according to a senior state official, had three stages.
The official claimed that there was a spokesman for President George Charamba, then the head of the Central Intelligence Organisation Aaron Nheper and a clergyman representing the bishop of the Roman Catholic Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to forward the offer to the President of Chiwenge, who was head of the Zimbabwe Defense Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death even more than life was considered an icon of Africa, was vainly trying to get UA to condemn military action by trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer made by the late (Mugabe) then to the Chief of Defense (SSO) Chiwenge did not result in a choice.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that gained a dangerously fast pace by removing a part of the deceased family," the official wrote (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation, by which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a totally ungraduate manner.
Just remind yourself that the commanders have declared that they did not overthrow and break the constitutional order, which would be the reason for their conflict with the UA position on coups.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders' claims that they did not overthrow the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was the fact that the UA, which, by way of marginality, was still highly confused by the whole situation and how it could fit into its theoretical taxonomy of coups, would have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in that spirit and with such a reckoning that the offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made the move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the mighty man that he was risking a Qaddafi-style lynch.
The military chiefs told him they wouldn't return their rifles against the citizens if they went to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same moment, Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and prove that the army had taken over," the official added.
The local SS and commanders read the assumptions correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who carried this desperate message was given to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that the isu tyri vomawapa-kachapa (we are part of the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians, nor do we compete with each other at political level, said a senior civil servant.
Officials tell the state that the military notified the military commanders in the area through the attachés who were in Zimbabwe that they had no intention of overthrowing Mugabe but of dealing with the surrounding “criminists”.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try again Mnangagwa to return from a short exile to South Africa to talk about coup and success.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, who are the key elements of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that President Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the army finds Mugabe, as it has repeatedly feared in the background, the armies of South Africa will immediately appear in Harare.
"It did not work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route," said an informant.
China needs strong leadership or will "disintegrate" as the policy paper states.
China needs a strong, unified Communist Party leadership, because otherwise the country will “deplete” – the government stated in a policy paper issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in a White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took power 70 years ago has led the party.
The Chinese occupy a large area, have complex national conditions, and the difficulties of administration are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without China's single and strong leadership, they will move towards divisions and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long applied hard-handed policies to solve the problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who will lead the celebrations of the second world-wide economy on Tuesday, strengthened the party's governments and sanctions against those who might challenge the power of government by the end of 2012.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme, which has driven the region out of balance.
The document found that China was not trying to export its development model or to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, rather than “hegemony”.
The Chinese don't have any other nation's conquest or domination of the world in their genes.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and anxiety have been deeply entrenched by the sufferings experienced; China will never cause other sufferings that they have suffered.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country engaged in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the liberating economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong China.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow them to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document stated that "the danger of commercial wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not solve problems".
China has matured the economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide market place and a strong economic growth rate.
The document added that "trade wars will never weaken it".
China is certain that it is able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should look rationally at the development of China, because China does not intend to question the position of the United States or do not want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely it will stop China's development.
Reducing and weakening other countries and transferring national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
The world of Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, a true face
The Dubai Emirates is still looking for its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveism.
This marked new trends of the world's tourism leader arouses imagination and desires, flattering the futility of wealthy snobbish hotels and attracting seeking fortunes of investors and traders with tax haven status.
Websites threaten enthusiasm for this city of dreams, an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of architecture in the 21st century.
The emirat, rich in sand, has become the Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather, and swimming pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many admire the ubiquity here, appreciate the creative hyperactivity and hysterical pursuit of avant-gardeness.
Here is the city whose motto says all: “Surprise, dazzle, and bewitch. ”
And it's almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a characterless city.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, "the metropolis has taken on a delicate grotesque dimension."
It has turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Records, an unofficial Emirate Constitution.
Because everything here has to be bigger and nicer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something in the old Europe that may be less transparent but important to the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
And not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off his golden mask, revealing the second face of an artificial paradise.
Faces that aren't spoken of loudly and don't write.
I am showing the misery of the Asians contrasting with the fabulous living conditions of the divine Cuban ethnic caste, the grandchildren of the indescribable Bedouins.
I enter places of extreme poverty, such as a ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where there is an army of Asian workers under cruel conditions.
It was they who built in one generation in slavery conditions, reaching the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here visited by good wages and the possibility of living a decent life for their families, and they were nightmares.
The tourist will never see it, because it could blow up in the air created over the years by the myth of Dubai.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of less labour more difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned diet talks from her home after her struggle with eating disorders.
Melanie Chisholm, of the Spice Girls team, admitted that there was a ban on diets in her home after she had struggled with eating food disorders for years, eating only fruits and vegetables.
For years, Spice’s sports did not get tired and “obsessively exercise” due to pressure associated with being a world-famous pop group member, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
It now reveals that her experiences affect how she rears her daughter Scarlet, so “it does not allow her home to be talked about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak with her.
Using a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for Women's Health Mel magazine, which won fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before social media was created, the “insulting” media commented on her complexes.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, practicing increasingly obsessively until I began to have a lack of weight," he said.
"I was sick and it probably took me a few years."
The picture that shook the world
A Polish girl and an American documentary gave the world a certificate of war cruelty.
The legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak for the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio performance documentary, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September days of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship echoed widely in the West.
Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he's been trying to be anywhere in the warthog.
400 planes and artillery nearly a nonstop attack on the city.
Bryan spent time in the pictures dying, suffering, fighting to survive in the city's ticks.
Just before his surrender, he and the embassy staff exported the negatives to the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will be Paris, London, and even New York”.
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States was preparing for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They were making films that were gloryging their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Arguing before the jury against a former athlete accused of multiple rapes
The jury is facing a rape trial filed by the former Delaware University team, which is charged with numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, jury members decided the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who was 21 years old claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two acquaintances were concluded on Bumble's website and the woman's photo was sent to the man who was naked.
The woman is one of six accused Conaway of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
According to the accusers, the hugging that the woman agreed to has turned into rape, which has been the case with her opposition.
Defendants refer to women’s conflicting relationships and gaps in memory and claim that the woman probably regretted that there was an intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bicycle for a million gold
A gold-covered bicycle worth a million gold could be seen on the 10th edition of the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, just received a bicycle Oscar for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
- The bike is covered with a golden spray chromium, below which is the highest sample of silver.
It's an unusual coating made by my friend from Zor.
"There's a saddle, there's pedals, there's a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can grow at 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bicycle," his constructor specifies.
‘The bicycle body was printed on 3D printer.
It's a cube that creates a kind of faith.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a card and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for the realization.
The bike itself was built for three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
Inside are the batteries, the wires, the elements forming the structure.
It is hidden under a body laid in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
That's where the engine is hidden.
The steering wheel for this bike was set up a week before I left for the United States at the World Bike Show.
I couldn't really decide what this steering wheel was meant to be.
She's a transporter.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he sums it up.
The gold-covered bike was awarded in Las Vegas the most important competition category “Best Amazing Single Customer Model”.
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
Sydney Bay is surrounded by an opera house, the port of Circular Quay, the amusement park Luna Park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge makes a significant contribution of $21.9 billion, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge there's an ugly truth.
The famous Sydney Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, where the volume of pollution affects about 15 Olympic swimming pools each year.
These terrifying statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our ugliest aquariums.
According to a new film entitled “Sydney Cove – Up and Down”, the waters around Australia’s most popular city are full of napaloos, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this flows into the bay with rainwater.
However, the largest part of our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," said Dr Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a video published on 27 September, and the publication of this film coincides deliberately with World Tourism Day.
This aquen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimated that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic would reach our waterways and that most of it would influence the bay through the storm drain.
"After the massive fall of the bay... it looks quite tragic," Dr. Dafforn said.
Two thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as in the case of the ice mountain, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic available to the ocean hits the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless time is spent under water, you cannot really realize what is in the depths there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's under water), they'd just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... more than half what we find on the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all this other garbage is coming right out of the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and Managing Director of Ocean Protect, said there were ways in which people, both local and tourist, could help reduce the amount of plastic and leftovers available to our waterways.
"This must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use, better drive back the materials, and have a greater awareness of what we put into the drains that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're going to be devastated, because 50% of the oxygen we breathe is coming from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can sort this bay and bring it back to its original greatness, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the recycling company TOMRA as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that are often in the environment coincides with the study of the relationship between artificial and mental health, which was published this month.
A new survey of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 found that 82% of respondents feel helpless in relation to plastic waste and 25% of adults' wines for problems with disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste coming to the oceans were growing.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just didn't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.
Poland – Slovenia.
Meme after the game of sitters in the semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenians had a lively audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish networkers.
There was also much controversy between judges, who in one action did not count four on the part of the hosts.
This happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vitala Heynen's subordinates had the chance to bounce off rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles finally had to recognise the superiority of the rival, who, after the 3-1 win, will play in the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support mental hospital in Akra
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated 30,000 GH worth of food yesterday? A mental hospital in Akra during a short ceremony in Akra.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The operator of the National Cloud, PKO BP and PFR, entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is designed to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw – a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central and Eastern Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of the company.
The partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we outlined not a year ago, announcing the appointment of the Operator of the National Cloud.
The aim remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamic of its growth.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
Taking advantage of them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining their group today significantly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagello, president of PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy as an important element of national digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions to entrepreneurs based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best professionals," adds Paul Boris, president of the FR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products in the service portfolio such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The integration of Google Cloud services into the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," notes Michal Potoček, president of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrendes, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power necessary for the processing of huge data sets.

There was a legend of a Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dance that led DJ Wick.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have a key to treating cancer - researchers have made breakthrough discoveries that may revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way of masking some cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process takes place in the Tasmanian devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do the Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to treating deadly tumors within the face that threaten the future of the threatened Tasmanian devil.
The study identified a way of masking some cancer cells in humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables the marker, which would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may be the biggest challenge for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and the type of skin cancer called Merkla cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP Chief Investigator Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-inclusion of markers called MHC proteins, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"Possibly it has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will once be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is remarkable that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"So far, it has been very difficult to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian devils.
But if medicines that work in people can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists are amazed at the fact that there's a very large planet orbiting a really small star
Scientists express surprise at the discovery of a solar system that is 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the process of creating planets, since in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter is orbiting around a small star called the red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of a gas-type planet giant GJ 3512b orbiting a red dwarf central star, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, the stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting them.
However, according to scientists on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 represents about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half of the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who headed the research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low mass stars tend to become home stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case we have discovered a planet of a gas giant similar to Jupiter orbiting a very small star," said Morales.
This planet, which, like Jowisz, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
Star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paleer than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That is why they have red colour," said Morales.
"There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," said Morales.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the action model, the object initially comes from solid particles in the disk, and the gravitational force of the planet at an early stage of development allows for an atmosphere from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called the gravity instability model.
"In this case the protoplanetary disk around a young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to disc stability and may result in some denser areas.
These masses can grow until the moment the planet collapses and forms.
Delicacy worker accused of administering a beans dip co-worker containing methamphetamine
The sheriff's office in Marion County detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for serving a fellow worker with a methamphetamine dip.
On Thursday, a 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of delivering methamphetamine and of consuming this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree offences.
The indictment was filed on the basis of an event from 9 September which took place at the Thriftway Food Shop in Jefferson.
In a statement made under oath by the Portal OregonLive.com, the 27-year-old associate of the suspect said to the deputy sheriff of Marion that during the lunch break she had seen Medina-Hernandez making a dip in beans, which she had then served.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported to the investigators, never took the methamphetamine, said that she “thought that one of the pieces she ate tasted strangely, but it did not arouse any suspicion. ”
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach disorder and that she couldn't stand up.
According to the newspaper Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was determined that the dip beans could contain methamphetamine.
According to police reports from The Smoke Gun, another Thriftway employee said that Medina-Hernandez “told her that she would add drugs to food”, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message saying that the meth went to the fasole dip by accident.
The OregonLive site reports on the surveillance from the delicacies, which allegedly shows how backwards to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, becomes behind the microwave and bends.
Then it straightens out, wipes its nose, approaches the table and puts the dip in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the stuff she pulled out of the bra was probably also on the plate.
The Statesman-Journal of Oregon reports that the sheriff's office employees now claim that there is no suspicion that contaminated food is being given to customers.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison, with a deposit of $520,000.
According to The Smoke Gun, her extensive police records indicate that a woman has already been convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, meth, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of illicit weapons.

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about the chief of NI?
Rent of property for an amount below market price – these are objections that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.
What the Treasury is doing in this case we asked the Treasury Board in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel presented doubts in the report for the “Supervisier” TVN about statements of property of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Mariana Banasia.
Since the few months of the study, the Central Anti-Corruption Office has been in operation.
The check is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In fact, he received 65.7 thousand zlotys a year.
The “Supervisier” report revealed that a hotel was located in a building rented by him for hours.
The chief of NIK later explained on state television why he only collected over 5,000 zlotys a month for renting the property.
“The Electoral Gazette”, referring to the property value experts, estimated that it should be 15 000 zlotys per month for the stone itself.
“The amount was lower for a simple reason: I made a preliminary agreement and it was because the tenant was about to buy this stone, that I agreed to a lower rent, that the remaining dues would be settled when selling the stones”, Banas argued.
However, there were doubts as to whether such proceedings constituted an infringement of the law.
Konrad Zawad, spokesperson for the Chamber of Treasury in Krakow, informed TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All such questions please refer to the Minister of Finance," he added.
He explained that in such cases, “the National Treasury Administration conducts the activities”.
Minister of Finance Paul Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of cases that may raise objections.
"The National Treasury Administration works in such a way that it has its own information, and it is also based in some way on the information that is publicly available.
On this basis, he decides whether to conduct any specific case, whether or not to conduct any proceedings," the MF spokesman explained.
"Because we are all in existence in the entire financial sector, we are therefore never speaking out, because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," he stressed, asked about Mariana Banasia.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the Treasury does not communicate this type of message to the public".
"It is known that the entire treasure machine deals with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Keys to the Royal Family: Surprising guests often flying a royal plane have been revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must make hundreds of trips around the world.
This usually facilitates the royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world for important events and events.
It is not surprising that having an airplane of its own involves privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues to check out, their limits do not apply to the number of luggage and, it turns out, they can invite any guests on board – including really unusual ones.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 documentary, not only Queen and Prince Philip often travel on a royal plane.
During the program entitled “Kingdom Flight Secrets”, a former royal flight navigator revealed that guests often flew with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It is not surprising that the queen may have longed for her beloved loved ones to accompany her on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to dogs of the Corgi race.
From the earliest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a fan of these four - horned creatures and has heard that since the coronation she has owned more than 30 corgis.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who are the crucifix of the Corga: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane certainly had their hands full.
A worker of the royal house was seen bringing out dogs and asking them to meet their needs before taking them aboard the plane, says Shields.
I'm glad to say there's never been an incident.
The program also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the queen takes aboard during her journey in the course of her duties.
The narrator said: “In 1953 the queen took a luggage weighing 12 tons on her journey of 70,000 kilometres. ”
To be able to do this better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only person with fashion impairment.
It is said that Princess Cambridge also enjoys the transportation of her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new law is in force.
In case of injury, they will receive pensions.
On Friday, regulation is in force to provide for the seriously injured in the event of a further payment of the rent – the Financial Ombudsman informs.
This is the Law of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of the injured in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, there were significantly lower guarantee amounts than at present, hence, in some cases, the insurers had already ceased the payment of the pension.
"I am glad of this regulation because our institution has been seeking for many years to create a mechanism that will provide seriously damaged financial support from the insurance of the Communication OC or OC of the farmer, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Dashewski, legal adviser at the Ombudsman's office.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because this is often a very tragic situation for people in very poor health who cannot work because of the accident, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of so-called guarantees in OC policies.
Parts of it were threatened in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurer were significantly lower than that of the current one.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in previous years was most common for people who suffered injury in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low, and economic conditions led to a rise in prices.
"We also noticed that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount of the sum was EUR 350 000 for each injured person in the accident.
At present, it is €5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of casualties.
So this is a huge difference from earlier times, so the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Dashewski.
It explains that since the guarantee amount is raised every once in a while, the legislator has adopted that the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the amount of the guarantee in force at the time of the payment of the pension claim to the Fund.
This rule shall apply where an insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay a pension on the basis of a judgment of a court determining the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC insurance contract.
This is the case in case of an increase in the guarantee amount on the judicial basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing obligation relationship.
"In the last few days we have sent letters to people who in the past have asked us to intervene.
We are informing them about new powers and, of course, ensuring that further support can be provided if any problems arise," says Aleksander Dashewski.

Brenda Barattini sentenced to death for cutting off her boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, that's when Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend had shown friends the sextasm that was built in their bedroom.
A 28-year-old woman, who is an architect from education, explained before the court that her partner thus ruined her life and treated her as a “trophy” that you can boast of in front of your friends.
“He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's resident decided to make her own justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
Using an velvet belt, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the cutter and cut off his penis.
"I felt as if I were going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled up my pants and grabbed the cell phone to call 911," the victim said.
"I wanted to leave, but she began to insult me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair without letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by exposing her to sextasm, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said towards the jury.
Finally, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
The former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards died at the age of 91.
On Friday, a retired congressman of the state of Alabama died from the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesman said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting a pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from Alabama State in the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 terms of office in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like to return politely.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will grow up in a country where there is a common debate and effort to resolve the country's problems will return to kindness," Edwards said, according to a family statement.
Alabama State Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his post and country with highest standards of honesty.
She added that in his honor the flag of the Alabama State Capitol will be abandoned to half the mast.
"He was the person of a true state official and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most famous politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the charts and makes our world get better".
The Princess and Prince Harry, currently a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archy Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with young people earlier this week, during which they met the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Highness, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "the caring leader who breaks the schematics and makes our world get better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Is it by meeting the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFundation, whether by helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, adding a picture of a smiling Meghan posing with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, guest-edited by the former actress of the Suits series.
In a frank conversation, the first lady spoke of motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to the art of forgiveness" she said in Obama's interview.
"Maternity has taught me that most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be their age, but who they are at heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being a candlestick is, shared with the princess’s advice during an interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The press you feel – forced by you and others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
"My advice is therefore to slow down and not to rush into anything.
I spent the first few months in the White House mostly worrying about my daughter, making sure they were doing well at school and making new acquaintances before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaint of the owner's disposition
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Washington Drink Control Commission has submitted an application requesting that a local Trump International Hotel facility should lose its license to sell alcohol due to the owner's condition.
On Wednesday, the Agency ruled that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded, as most of them do not live in or have no real estate in the district.
"The Washington Post" states that for the second time these reasons are seeking to withdraw the hotel's liquor license, referring to a provision in force in the district saying that the applicants for a liquor license must prove to be a "good mood".
In the original complaint filed last summer, it was claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and there were allegations of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was dismissed as the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the renewal of the licence.
"The Sun": The Crushing Report recognises Cleveland police scandals as the worst in the United Kingdom
The inspectors considered COMPROMMITTING SCANDALS police to be the worst in the UK.
In an intermittent report, the Cleveland police were seen as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Royal Bridge Police, claims that the Cleveland Police Department had "significantly worsened" standards.
There have been new appeals calling for the resolution of police services, with five commanders headed in six years.
According to the report, police have not tried to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weak.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of Her Royal City Police said: “Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards. ”
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious", though undisclosed, charges concerning his case.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before the commission for commissioning female coworkers to engage in sexual activities.
He's off duty.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Tories said: “This is an official confirmation that these services are compromised.
The time has come for him to intervene with the Home Office now."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said: “After making improvements, I take full responsibility for making the police force change. ”
We have a skatepark visualization!
Are Young People Finally Waiting?
Older residents are hindered by young people’s passions for skating and skateboarding, in turn they complain that there is no place for them in Olav.
For years, young people have been reminded of a place to ride skates, skateboards, hulayña, bicycles.
The subject is still coming back to our faults.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
It's been loud lately about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're back at the office asking what's next?
We're reminded that a few days ago, a woman who was disturbed by a young man who was driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block near Pilsudski so that they can be interested in the situation of the Olav youth," he writes to the Malgorzata editorial board.
"The residents of the block have repeatedly called the City Guard ineffectively.
I'm sending pictures to prove these everyday situations in addition."
We've asked the others about the matter.
Most clearly state that young people simply do not have a place to drive in the city, and they have been demanding places for themselves for years.
On Facebook, even an avalanche of comments appeared.
Already in July, we wrote that there is a chance that the skatepark was built on the town of Olavsk.
The mayor announced that the city had requested funding for the construction of the skatepark.
‘The project consulted with the licences is ready.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to fund the task of "Budowa Skatepark in Olava" under the sport programme Poland", we were told in office.
Total value of the project: PLN 798 306,00.
Amount of funding requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we've asked again what the stage of the case is.
"We do not yet have information on the determinations made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism of the application for funding," says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European Funds Department UM Olav.
"It follows from the information received from the Ministry employees that finally the selection of all tasks under the Polish Sports Program should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the Olav skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editor that on the coming Saturday (September 28th) they would be collecting signatures on a petition about the construction of a skate park in Olav.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they will organize the collection," he writes to the Mikolaj editorate.
The signatures under petition will be collected from 12: 00 p.m. around Lidl Market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 finals.
We know couples, hit years ago.
It was one of the most exciting rivalries in the extracurricular.
The biggest legend has grown in memory since the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took over the old stadium at the Lazienkowski Łódź Łódź Łódź team in the last line.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, the second from the order of the Polish championship gave a point.
Up to 87 minutes Legia ran 2:0, but for five more minutes there was an earthquake – Vidzew shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club, with its passing years, was becoming increasingly troubled until it stopped counting on the championship fight and fell off the top of the game.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in 2013/2014.
Legia – on the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 at home and 1:0 at the departure.
Return to elite
Currently, boats are fighting for a return to national elites.
These plans have been delayed by at least a year, as in previous games as one of the favorites, they have not been able to advance on the back of the extracurricular.
As a result, in summer failures occurred at the club in a human revolution.
Powers have changed, they've finally been placed on coach Marcin Kachmark, and in making the next step up the club's hierarchy, they're going to help finish in the league fights of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Mobs.
For the time being, Vidgew is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in the Polish Cup he beat the extracurricular squador Silesian Wrocław 2:0 on Tuesday.
The legion in the same sizes played on the departure of the Pušta Niepolmica.
Extracurricular starter
The only pair composed of top-class representatives in 1/16 finals are made up of ŁKS and Hornik Zabrze.
The games of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, 1/8 finals were scheduled for play (3-5 December).
The final is scheduled to take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “wake up” and the investigation of the impeachment must roll his own track
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are taking part in an attempt to conceal the facts of the attempt to conceal the facts, and the investigation in this case may take time," Pelosi said in a report to CNN on the Hill of the Capitol.
"They will do the work they have started, holding on to the facts and time needed to find them," she added.
A protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump asked the president of Ukraine, Wolodymyr Zelenski, to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as the protocol indicates.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that National Security Lawyers from the Justice Department had notified a complaint lodged by a signaller concerning Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before a formal notification.
After receiving a complaint in the form of a complaint from officials from Community Intelligence, the Justice Department stated that Trump’s phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call for a witness.
She added, however, that she felt that Barr “has rebelled. ”
It's been a long time.
"Although (Barra) mentions all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general during a July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
I wonder if he's made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi said that he was "very afraid" of the whistleblower informants Trump attacked Thursday as a spy, suggesting that he had been treated differently in the past with spies.
I think the President's words go beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in the discovery of – the detection of offences in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "The words of the President concerning persons who can provide information clearly undermine honesty in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step in declaring a formal investigation into an illegal act based on allegations of attempts to pressure a foreign leader to gain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signaller claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "inclusion Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signalist also argued that White House lawyers had ordered officials to remove the record of the interview from the computer system in which it was kept for the purposes of the Council of Ministers officials and to place it in a system designed for information that was particularly sensitive.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned by the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and a member of the Sekondi Hasaacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Committee for the upcoming elections to the National Football Association in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the involvement of Commission President Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he questioned whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons from the outside who have no ties with any of the members and who have previously shown no interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer about the payment of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in it," he argued.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, had a conflict of interest from the President on account of his relationship with the club, suggesting that if Palmer's State were to be brought before the Commission, he would be subject to prejudice and partiality.
Members of the Commission were expected to start their work from yesterday, following an oath at the GFA Secretariat in Akra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to conclude on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and her members are Corporate Governance Consultant and Attorney Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokawie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue-White Alliance and Likud, continued negotiations Friday on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the president's delegation to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu as prime minister, but, as the Israeli daily Haarec says, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue-White informed the Communication that it had presented its preliminary proposals.
Likuda's rightful charge is that he has “began to rest in his positions”, demanding that his leader and previous prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in his office, which was previously part of ultraorthoxic politics.
"From the very beginning, it was known that Blue-Biali would not agree to these conditions," the Communication published by them said.
For many, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, want to "make Israel a second round of elections".
The leader of the Blue-White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyhahu would direct as long as he is charged with three corruption cases on which the prosecutor could formally accuse him after Wednesday's meeting.
"People and Blue-Biali have obtained in the 17 September elections a sufficient majority to allow them to share governments as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate which neither party has wanted," the EFE said.
President Reuwen Riwlin tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and proposed the establishment of a "Rotational Authority", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanyahu were maintained and formalised.
There is no shortage of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by calling on the government of unity under the rotating leadership to change Netanyahu and Gantz.
50.6 percent of Israelis, 32.1 percent of respondents object to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – on the question of who first should be at the head of the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents are in favour of Netanyahu and 40% are in favour of Gantz.
In another survey published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of government supporters of unity increases to 63%, 60% opposed to new elections that would be thirds this year.
On 17 September, in the early parliamentary elections, the Gantz Alliance won 33 seats in the 120-seat Knight, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz – 54.
None of the proponents gathered 61 mandates necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that “this is the time to check out” when Walia faces the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the kangaroos would set this team at the position of a favourite for Group D win and ensure participation in a likely quarter final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Walia for 14 times during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to start with England in one eighth of the finals.
"Let us make the matter clear, both teams want to try to get through it and find themselves at the head of the group," said Welsh wrestler Tipuric.
In the past there have been some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they'll be eager to take that victory away from us, and we want to bring it back.
Before we got here, you knew it would be a big start.
And now we're here and it's really time to check.
Walia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in a third place in the game when the Kangaroo defeated.
And their total record under chief coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to beat three heavyweight teams out of the southern hemisphere.
Walia represented a series of 13 losing test matches from Australia's hands in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few saved from the 9-6 win that would run to Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric asked if the team had experienced a mental block before that victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect there to be some kind of mental blockade, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks a lot less advantage than it actually was.
If Walia is traumatized, then the fight of Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of mill by Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and downfall will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colors of the team and met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are players in the seventh absolute world class," he said.
When playing against the world-class players of the third mill line, it is always known that there will be a difficult game to play.
These two keep playing with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better feeling rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than face a third line of mill that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you fight these two, you definitely have to be on top of it.
I wouldn't say Sunday's almost the end of the Cup, but for us, it's an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is an essential element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put forth great effort, we will fly on our wings, and it will be hard to defeat us.

They were supposed to be the elite race of the lords.
They took in the ranks of those whom they despised.
Is it possible to combine crime more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we are not giving another book on military or military issues.
We are giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries in Europe analyze the attitude and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities, and look at the recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why did it fail to create a unit made up of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative on cooperation in the various European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book Waffen-SS answers these questions, based on solid research material.
We have sought to present a more subtle and balanced picture of cooperation in Europe during the Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of history and a given period of history through the presentation of trials by researchers from different countries. (...) As the fates of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovenian population - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are examined from a national perspective (as far as they are done).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling to find arguments on the impeachment
Officials from the White House are ashamed to think about how to resist the pressure on the impeachment renewed on Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a response to the new reality.
It seems that it helps to "disquiet, uncertainty and fear" – one person associated with the White House thus describes the mood in the western wing – that the allegations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people in his surroundings.
She said, “There is no guarantee that nothing is hiding there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods for effectively avoiding controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that will pass with the emergence of the next cycle of message headlines" – this person joked.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “a state of shock”, accompanied by an increasing distrust that, together with the ongoing investigation into the impeachment, the likelihood that the President would respond irresponsibly and become “hard to control” is increasing.
This fear is shared by another interviewer who claims that the president's environment anticipates that he will manifest a more "controversial" behaviour and that the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the investigation of the impeachment.
This raises concerns that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way explode – this is in the context of the electoral year both from the perspective of the Presidency and the elections.
Faced with the biggest threat to the presidency, Trump has circled from attack to defense, reaching out again for a strategy that he considered effective during Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in investigating his political rivals in order to distract and direct him to the actions of the Democrats and Democrats' candidate, Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as a party leader.
But while many people in the White House are being put into battle after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed – consultants and consultants have said.
The president, whose exploratory mark is force, showed the Wednesday press conference as a defeated person – one of the people familiar with the situation said.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold to the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of this controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski – which they say undermines his credibility.
And as often happens, when the president is the object of the attacks, this fact is brought up alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies associated with the White House indicates that the results of the polls of support for the president are unorthodoxly high, and the impeachment will not have too much effect on the acquisition of new sympathies.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if it makes his legislative programme difficult and predominates in the new cycle of message headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Worried White House officials sought help from counselors by completing a response team to the impeachment.
According to a person with knowledge of plans, given that these efforts are in early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command centre will be taken and what form it may take.
This person has stated that he is convinced that a coordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a strong leader who is able to carry out a PR attack, which is a ripost to publish a nutritious signalling report and to halt the initiation of democratic action on the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The interviewer states that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose a note describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later, it was felt that there was no way out and the document had to be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which has largely remained silent, and has spoken only through accusations. One of the people who can be involved in the response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trump's dirty work and former head of election staff, stated the person involved.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not true that he will direct this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his programme," he said, "but I have not been involved in any discussions with the President or his team about joining the team in order to resist the false narrative of impeachment."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the operation of the impeachment.
"We respond to matters properly" – Sekulow replied when asked by NBC News for comment.
At present, the White House is experiencing a lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked with Clinton's Emperor and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current advisor, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The interviewer, familiar with the White House strategy, stated that the officials generally did not plan at any time to engage people or create a command centre, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint reaction and a person who could lead a political struggle.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding "sudden pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of the state of California can't seem to bear the naked truth that there's an investigation into President Donald Trump.
On Thursday's defense, he accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the Board of Interview of the Chamber of Representatives, filed the charges in the course of the preliminary statement during the hearing of the signaller's complaint, as if Trump had appealed to Ukraine for assistance in the initiation of an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque performance" of the left hand and their "medium ass", before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in negligee.
"Democrats in this commission have negotiated with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," Nunes said.
"People may rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president on trial when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished reprimanding, HuffPost's political reporter, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... discover it.
So far, only a representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his response is a naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspected that Nunes's comments on the nudity referred to "some more important and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in Steele's controversial acts,
This is a famous collection of charges against Trump, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape showing him watching the urine of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on renewable biofuels may help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be the diversion of renewable energy – airplanes.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed technology that will enable renewable biofuels to be used as a fuel for aviation.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Department of Agriculture, Science and the Environment, which started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuels derived from fat waste, such as fat from the restaurant, fat from the animal and rape oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, as well as waste from other industries.
This technology is designed to imitate the hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] the creation of hydrocarbons which are identical to diesel fuels."
While this opens up a new option for biofuels, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which in the case of aircraft flying at high altitudes posed a serious threat.
"The problem with air fuel is a bit of a wrong wheel," Bressler said.
It's actually worth less than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuel and hydrogen addition.
The second option is to continue working on the chemical properties already developed, which will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a bit," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialising the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, are increasing investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine a time when the situation may be reversed and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Currently, Forge runs a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support the 25 million-dollar construction of a production facility to be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the proposed reduction of coal will be about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will prevent further carbon reductions.
"As a tech specialist," said Bressler,
I have the task of developing options that enable conscious decisions and many choices."
FACILITIES: Another deception on a grandchild
€8 000 and €750 lost Zaměstia's apartment thinking she was helping her grandson, who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday to the son of the contraband.
"A woman was called on Wednesday by a man who pretends to be her grandson.
He said that he had caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he'll go to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she passed 8 thousand PLN and 750 euros to the fake policeman who came to her house," says Ms. Dorota Krukowski-Bubilo of the overseas police.
The police are looking for the perpetrator, and once again they call for caution:
‘Any phone requesting financial assistance should be verified.
You should not act emotionally or in haste.
Remember, cops don't ask for money or take money.
If we get a call asking for financial support that raises our suspicions, we need to respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the threats, let's let the frauds know how they work.
Let us ask for caution and not trust in those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that in the event of the UK's brexis being lifted, there is a threat to the US like in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the chief cabinet ministers said last night that the country is at risk of "a violent social upheaval", if the initial result is questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
Britain's allies warned from their immediate surroundings that the country is at risk of social unrest as a result of protests of "yellow vests" in France due to social inequalities and housing in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a "satisfying mood" during a heated argument about the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "to surrender".
Despite his call for peace, the Minister of the Cabinet said "The Times": "In this country there have never been any protests such as "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vests") or living in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – using encrypted phones that can coordinate pickets, and pushing people to protest is enough for some unsuspecting populist leaders.
Residents in Los Angeles erupted after the jury exonerated four white police officers who killed Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – gilet jaunes – have been desolate for more than six weeks and have devastated the streets of Paris.
The minister referred to a warning by the General Assembly of Johnson and said that if the UK fails to leave the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people will vote and 66% of them will speak for the remaining UK in the European Union, ten million citizens will be dissatisfied," the Minister said.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their Member and who will not forgive.
Not many people need to see thousands of people on the street soon.
One of the chief cabinet ministers added that the country is threatened with "serious social upheaval", if the outcome of the first referendum is challenged by the result of the second.

Follow us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Simon Hłonownia, Christine Chubowna, and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expansion of the horizons, discussion of ideas worthy of publicity, and joint discussions that can become an impetus for further development.
The organisers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 special speakers to the stage, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them among the people known from the media - Simon Hollowia, Kristina Chubowna and Ireneusz Krosnya.
The slogan of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and it was around the creation of the future that the guests invited to the conference focused on the appearance.
The first session was opened by the managing director Sabre Polska, Sebastian Driewiecki, who spoke about how the brand that is built around us can affect our future.
Richard Lucas took the stage to change public perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted, if the future is to be created, Chris Badura, in turn, took up the subject of empathy in the era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multifaceted conversation with Krystina Chubowna, who explained, among other things, how the profession of lecturer in Poland changed from its perspective over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to the development of technology, everyone today can struggle with this profession.
However, in the coming years, he does not think that man in his position should be completely replaced by technology.
It was after her that Peter Nabelec raised the problem of life in times of information, emotional overload, or overburden on choice, giving the public valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Lukasz Lętów spoke in his speech about what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Having fun teaching, learning to have fun
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions, inviting an illusionist, Daniel Ostenak, to the stage.
In turn, the third part of the conference opened by Ireneusz Krosna, who first entertained the audience with pantony and then, on his own career, told how he wanted to maintain the right balance between careers on stage and private life.
In his speech, he also kidnapped Simon Hallina, stressing, above all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and you need to be ready to take advantage of this time.
In addition, the branch shared its thoughts about the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that could cause smiles on the audience’s faces.
Then Adrian Twouszka appeared on the scene, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Slovak, on the example of Rubik's Cube, he related the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new into the perception of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests show a great deal of public commitment.
The organisers provided a broadcast for all who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-division of power," the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights wrote in a report published on Thursday.
The report on "Legal Governments instead of rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in justice and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled “Legal governments instead of rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest regression in the field of human rights in Poland was recorded after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-division of power.
In adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," the HFPC experts write.
What's the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media and the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of LGBT and the right to a fair process).
The report also sums up a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to pursue party interests.
This has been translated into a continuing crisis of the rule of law, as well as a weakening of the entire system of human rights protection in Poland," stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As the report pointed out, the last four years have been "the period of systemic change in both the country and the "protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key instruments for the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often adopted at an accelerated pace, without social consultation and despite the reservations of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained Małgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the failure to respect binding judgments of courts and international recommendations of institutions and the weakening of the guarantee of human rights".
State authorities have not responded
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered "the situations in which state authorities have not responded or have directly disregarded the occurrence of aggression".
Foundation experts have noted that some changes have been introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the state's activity in the field of the limitation of the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also exposes the Polish state to liability for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of the Pakistani social media star with life for honour killing
Women's rights experts say that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected assassins on bail and the removal of public awareness cases.
"The third is so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, defender of women's rights and founder of the first gender faculty in Pakistan, adding that even the widespread murder of Baloch has been settled for more than three years.
Although, according to women's rights groups, reliable data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Commission on Human Rights in 2018 reported at least 300 so-called honour killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and a network promoting awareness of honorary crimes estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed worldwide in Pakistan every year.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the transmissions to the country are shrinking, as many emigrants sit outside Poland permanently – says the Friday “Rzeczpospolita”.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to over PLN 8.6 000 in 2018, which means that almost a thousand PLN, i.e. almost 12%, increased.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the countries of the Union in 2018 reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion, one seven more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Poles are getting better at international labour market, where they use various options available.
"There is also an increasing number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of better conditions, just like international corporate workers," the paper reports.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries over the year, such as the UK and Germany.
"It was in RFN in 2018 the most, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish migrants increased (to around PLN 27 billion).
However, the most they have earned Poles in the islands – almost 35 billion PLN", we read on.
The President of Euro-Taxu believes that despite improving working conditions in the Polish market, the number of migrant workers is not low.
The saxes in the West and north of Europe (in the lead of Norway) are often the chance for several times higher wages than in Poland.
"Even at minimum rates in the country concerned, which, for example in Germany, amount to 9.5 to 11.7 euros per hour," the Journal reports.
The “Rzeczpospolita” states that the Poles are not only left because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave abroad the roots, which are also visible after small remittances to the country.
These last year were the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Kristicki reminds us, with the extension of the stay abroad, the group of people who transfer money to the country is shrinking.
"The emigrants are bringing their loved ones together," reads the Friday "The Republic".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and unusual rainfall has caused death as a result of the collapse of buildings and the rotting of many crops.
Normally, monsun retreats in northern India in early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts at the Indian Department of Meteorology, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon for decades.
In many parts of the country, rains are still unusual – recently in the western Indian city of Pune Wednesday and Thursday rains have led to the death of several people and the devastation caused by the collapse of buildings.
There was home watering, people turned through the streets in water after knees, which usually occurs only during the apogeum of monsoon.
Large rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long - term rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started with the delay.
Many areas lacked water, so farmers prepared for a likely drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"By him my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the delayed and late effects of monsoon mean an increase in the price of onions, an indispensable ingredient of Indian food.
Onions, for which you usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds British), now costs 80 rupees (about 1 pound British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at risk.
The next big festival is the celebration of Dasar on 8 October, during which Hindus raise huge dolls like from a comic book, representing Ravana, a lush mustache and ominous smile from the Epos “Ramian”.
Ravany's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
But given that Ravany's likeness was made out of paper, if monsun continues, Ravana will be the last to laugh.

Doodle celebrates Google 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all of our nagging questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" are one of the favorite categories that Poles are looking for.
According to the giant, last year we were happy to ask, among other things, “Where is the storm?”, “How to make asparagus?” and “How many fingers does a horse have?”, “How to get rid of a flour of fruit?”, “How to eat?”
Today, the search engine is celebrating its 20th birthday.
Its users – and 96% of people in Poland use Google's Uncle – today's special Google Doodle.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthday, showing a fixed computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, the bottom corner was printed a digital date – as in a picture from the 1990s.
Catalogue of information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalog all possible information and make it available via the internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol indicating the number of ten raised to hundreds.
This name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to add as many web sites as possible.
Google was founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the normal aggregation methods based on the frequency of a given phrase.
At the beginning of the search, the search engine was called BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. on 7 September 1998 and soon later launched the famous Google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" provides information on the extremely accurate search results of Google.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, subjugate further markets and increase the company's value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has over a billion entries, which makes Page and Brina's work the largest online search engine in the world.
Currently, a company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.
Is there any other area for development?
“The Google mission is to organise global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this area, it is still a very long way for us to achieve this goal” in his conversation with “Newsweek” Peter Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that working with high levels of exposure to plant protection products can translate into a high risk of heart disease in later years.
This happened in the case of a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who have been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists have found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45 percent more exposed to heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in the medical records of contact with such measures at work, as well as to control standard factors that increase the risk of heart disease," said Dr Beatriz Rodriguez, coauthor of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in Kuakini Honolulu's cardiology programme.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as they only concern men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their health effects can take many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
This was likely because ageing factors were more important, which masked the possible causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in later years.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelenski-Trump telephone conversation: Porzenko throws his three cents
Washington's politics has been raging for a week in connection with the launch of an impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
Getting involved in a political scandal is for political debutante Wolodymyr Zelenski a situation he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching effects on the first of them?
Trump told Zelenski that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than the European countries at the start of the phone call.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders, along with other European leaders, are engaged in negotiations instead of making specific proposals.
The controversy aroused Zelenski's response, which said he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange made politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, decide to vote through social media.
Petro Porozenko, former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroszenko said he was grateful for the support given during the "Russian aggression" to the EU, which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their fears, such as Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now? ”
Trump then mentioned military assistance and asked Zelenski for investigation not in one case, but in two cases: the first case concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second case concerning breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether European relations will be damaged or if relations with the leader of France and Germany will be broken.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us" – he said after the publication of Zelenski's phone call in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the coming summit of the “Norse Four, ” to be held in October.
Former voivodship inspector legally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of his alleged actions.
After 6 years Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court in Industry cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Military Inspectorate of Trade Quality of Agricultural-Food Articles in Rzeszow, on charges of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin Public Prosecutor accused him of betraying the local marshal of the voivodship, the deadline for inspection at a food oil factory.
Recently, a lawful acquittal fell upon the case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
“The court held an arraignment in force,” confirmed Judge Małgorzata Reiser, spokesman for the Industrial District Court.
It is the judgment of 14 February, issued by the District Court in Industrial.
Jerzy Wiśniewski commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was introduced by the Appellate Office in Lublin to the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Podkarpackie Region Marshal on 30 April 2012.
The court made it clear that I was innocent and that I did not break the applicable law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone call at the time with the Podkarpacki Region Marshal was in compliance with applicable law.
The public media version of the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Lublin in 2013 was true and caused irreparable damage to both the food producer's business and the loss of my image with my employers, workers and the local community.
The indictment issued in the Court’s opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, inaccuracies of legal bases not confirmed in reality.
With the help of CBA in the Reich, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
At that time, I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of my financial resources.
I stayed for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind ourselves.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as Voivodship Inspector for Trade Quality of Agricultural and Food Articles between 2009 and 2013.
He was called off after the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin brought charges to him in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was to betray the local marshal of the province in a telephone call (Mirosław Karapida was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment) the deadline for inspection in a food-producing plant belonging to the wife of the then Vice-Marschael Podkarpacki.
This warning – according to Lublin prosecutors – was intended to cause the owner of the company to know about control and correct the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard allegations of violation of his rights, which threatened him to be deprived of his liberty for up to three years.
"I feel relieved that this case is finally over and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the lawful sentence which incriminates me from the charges I have been charged with," Jerzy Wiśniewski commented.
The White House was trying to hide a record of a conversation with Zelenski.
On Thursday's revised report, the signaller wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to Ukraine's President Wolodymyr Zelenski, sought the interference of the foreign state in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide a record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, an interviewer who is likely to be an interviewer, wrote: “I was informed by many members of the US government that the president was using his role to demand the interference of a foreign country in the elections in 2020 in the United States.
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
And precisely – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the reelection in 2020", says the report quoted by The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader was "understanded" that his contacts with Trump were dependent on whether to "show the will to play" in matters that the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani should have informed him more specifically.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its content by “many White House officials who had direct information on the subject”, and their relations overlapped.
"The following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that the White House officials intervened to "implement" all the archival records concerning this conversation, and especially the literal record that has been drawn up, as is usually done, in the White House crisis room," we read further.
"High-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers "have ordered them to remove the electronic record from the computer system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," the author wrote.
"In my assessment, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the speaker said.
According to the AP Agency, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on the President's possible impeachment, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the conversation with Zelenski White House, after the pressure of Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of electronic records, but on the basis of the reports of those who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in the revised version, was revealed a day later by the intelligence committee of the House of Representatives.
Joseph Maguire also testified before the Board of Inquiry of the House of Representatives on Thursday, explaining the manner in which the interviewer’s report was being handled.
Maguire said the signal player made the right choice and did what the law commanded.
He also pointed out that his point of contact with Zelenski was an event “without precedent”.
The Democrats in the interview committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the release of the signalling report to Congress; the intelligence director replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, whose confidential nature guarantees the so-called privilege of the executive authority.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that, due to the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
The day after, she estimated that Trump's recording with Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken the standards of election and security.
U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
However, the Justice Department ruled that the president had not violated electoral law. On Thursday, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham said that there was "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of third-hand relations and concerted press clippings".
"The White House will continue to criticise this media hysteria and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize was awarded in proof that Ghana has obtained the highest number of aviation safety surveillance points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent on the temporary implementation rate (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its control of the ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency's Universal Security Audit Programme.
The security prize was an evidence of the country's high involvement in the implementation of ICAO standards and protocols for security at airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme was designed to support the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates have been granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards.
The Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghana, Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo, and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiva Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain security in the airspace of the Member States.
He said, "It is important that we keep reminding ourselves that even in the era of innovation, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our main priorities."
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the state's efforts, as they complemented hard work and the sustainability of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying "aircraft has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but all are due to the security and security that we have achieved."
FACILITATION: Tanking and running, he also stole a bike
50-year-old from the municipality Zaměstě was driving his audio to the distributor, refueling and leaving without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations several times.
A month ago, a man also stole a bicycle from one of the German authorities.
The owners of the gas stations have estimated the losses to almost PLN 1 000.
Owner of stolen bicycle – for £2,000.
Last Tuesday, one of the neighborhoods in the country noticed at the University of Wyszyński's Audi, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
He was just sitting behind the wheel looking for 50-year-olds.
The man was detained in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of fuel theft from four gas stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to these crimes.
The uniforms also found a stolen bike.
One day, he'll be back with the owner soon.
Stealing a thief is punishable by imprisonment up to the age of 5.
Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he testifys at the Senate National Security Sub-Commission's meeting on the FEMA budget proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capitoline Hill in Washington, U.S.A. on 3 April 2019.
WAZINGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, American President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency who oversees a government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March, when Brock Long released the position.
Long resigned after the FEMA Department of Homeland Security found that Long had misused government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when an accurate examination of his past revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination for this position was expected.
The majority of the Senate will be required to approve his nomination for this role.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became deputy administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering finger amputation
A 28-year-old runner specialized at 1,500 metres, winning a gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurrich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the Deputy Minister of Europe for 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new burden and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but that the pain had returned and that this season had been very intense.
Pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes the system of my body, there are other unnatural strains and I start to feel pain elsewhere, for example in my hip.
For this reason I have not been able to prepare myself enough for the world's championships, and for two weeks now the pain is so intense that I have difficulty wearing rings," the runner said on the antenna of the TV channel of the NRK.
Father and coach Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, the only solution to not finish his career and participate in next year's Olympics in Tokyo will be amputation.
It seems that this is the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision has actually come to an end.
"If a part of the body is in pain, you should get rid of it, and in fact Henrik does not need it so much and in this situation you should forget the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police shut down illegal e-Paperes with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
On the office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue around 16:37 a raid was made, during which the police sought illegal e-papers containing marijuana and found large layers containing butane hashish oil – a concentrate of cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, the officers also found a device that was used to supplement the injection cartridges.
“This process is very dangerous” says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The usual electrostatic spark from our clothes can ignite these vapors, causing not only fire, but because of concentration, even explosion," he says.
“If we have many jars and similar ones in the room, another explosion will occur, causing not only fire, but also an explosion that could displace the entire complex from the surface.
A special task team was called to the office to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At present, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
The detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, thus detecting illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to get information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible took an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products have not been found on the street, given the recent articles on calcium toxicity.
"People don't really know what products they buy," says Cano.
"They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our community and children, which is why we always keep them from reaching out for this kind of thing.
Aphtin is withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided to inject the product into molds
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector has informed of the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat molds and yeast infections in the mouth, infections in Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to a non-compliance with the requirements of the product smell quality specification and a decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, each month, GIF issues several decisions to withdraw a series of products from the market.
The batch of medicine held in circulation in Poland can be reintroduced once evidence of its safety has been provided.
This is not possible if the medicine is withdrawn.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collector's banknote about this nominee?
It has a nominal 19 zloty, and it has the image of Ignace John Paderewski.
In early October, a new collector banknote will be launched – National Bank of Poland informed.
It's another banknote from the "Independence" series.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Factory.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the note.
The date on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the PWPW is held.
Also nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Factory" - read in the NBP communication.
The watermark shows the image of an eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after the independence has been restored.
The novelty is a holographic belt placed on a window under the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace John Paderewski, and next to the inscription “insurmountable” the picture of the Ord of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, based on Joseph Piłsudski's manuscript, is a logo of the 100th anniversary celebrations of Poland's return to independence.
The Wavřin branch, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, consisted of the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, a special form of angular effect.
On the reverse banknote page, there is a picture of the Factory gma in the background of the modern panorama of Warsaw.
Next to the PWPW logo is the SPARK Live security and the opalescent belt, also visible in light of UV in the form of repeating numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes the NBP.
The banknote is scheduled to enter the circulation of 55,000 units on 2 October.
One banknote will cost 80 zlotys.
All the coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from the special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collector’s market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, which is over two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the port of Easton where it was loaded onto the boat.
That's where he sailed 50 miles across the river.
Jarosław Kaczyński to vote in Gosievska Małgorzata
PIS President Jarosław Kaczyński will vote in the upcoming elections for Małgorzata Gosiewska.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosiewska posed for a photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw's "three" boasted in the social media that it will win Kaczyński's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"The President of the Law and Justice of Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska", we read on her Facebook profile.
The party chief indicated that he was a sensitive, sensitive person and was always ready to help.
"I will give my vote to the Gossivian Małgorzata, and I ask the same thing," he urges.
Gosiewska is running for Sejm from District 19. (Warsaw) and third place on the list.
"Only" is Kaczyński himself, and the second place is Mariusz Kaminski.
The Christmas Book Fair is coming.
In front of us are meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpatia are said not to read books.
We will show that it is different," she said during the press conference Martha Half Tuesday.
And who will support the reading in the Reich this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia will appear at the fairs, yelled at the first chef of the Republic, as well as: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Petrovska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn, the Millennium Hall will host the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookkeeping officers from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions, they will present their wide range of publishing opportunities and hundreds of novelty books that participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, authors were invited to write about important matters and are not afraid of taking on difficult topics, and are also winners of prestigious awards and... excellent cooks.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, participation in the fair was confirmed, among others, by Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best seller "Loneliness in the Network", and the very queen of the Polish crime: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cookbooks), sold in over 4 million copies.
An exhibition of the missing Elizabeth I dress at the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread of the dress made of the most famous silk camotte was handmade with embroidered embroidery representing vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curators of the Historic Royal Palace Foundation, this meant only one thing.
The faded fabric hung over the wall of the tiny rural parish church, which she had looked at, could only be a lost part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn encountered an exhibition of altar cloth in Bacton County of Herefordshire, the missing Elizabeth dress was to be found next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises in which the Tudor dynasty queen could wear it over 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that only one element of the 16th-century dress survived from the entire collection of royal dresses.
Although there is no solid proof that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research strengthened the experts to believe that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
The ‘Srebrogols’, an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoser quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the outfit belonged to the most famous of the people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could have cost the Tudor property equivalent.
"What's more, in the 1990s, which is at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such fine fabrics," Lynn says.
"As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at the dresses.
I really enjoyed seeing the dress, and they were also thrilled and convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, re-lived dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth lady of the court, served as queen throughout her long life and with which in the local legends identified the said cloth.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or the Blanche parish before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, of which four hundred went to the most delicate hand sewing using specially painted silk and fine surgical needles, the altar cloth will be displayed next to an exhibition rented during the Hatfield House Palace of the portrait “Rainbow Portrait”, one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"During working with historical fabrics, people who have done them are really respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a prefabricated glasshouse at the Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestry.
“Looking at the embroidery from the front and back, I began to feel a great respect for those who had made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will start on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch Agency confirms Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in a foreign currency at “A-” level – the communication stated.
The rating perspective has remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-versified economy, which is supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector", we read in a communication from the Ministry of Finance.
Fitch added that Poland was at the peak of the cyclical cycle and between 2019 and 2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland would be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively.
The Agency anticipates that the government deficit to GDP in 2020-2021 will remain below 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively.
"The government and government debt ratio for GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent according to the agency, and in the coming years it will be less (on average 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polish
On 11 October, the autumn round of Polish ratings reviews will be completed by S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in the assessment of Fitch remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's “A-” rating with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's credit credibility is the highest rated Moody's – level “A2”.
According to Fitch and S&P, the ratings of Poland are “A-”, one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies are set up to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing more than an assessment of creditworthiness.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much money to lend.
Sometimes this information also suggests who is best not to give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that money will not be recovered.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
In turn, the higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Each assessment shall be justified and reasoned.
Ratings can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing their reputation.
Currently, over 90 percent of the world credit rating market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
"Confederation Friday": First 1000 plus
“Friday of the Confederation”, i.e. the main drafts of the electoral programme, presented Friday in Koszalin candidates to the Sejm district 40 applying for a mandate from the KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, the leader of the koszalin letter to the Symium, presented the slogans “Fridays of the Confederation”.
"Firstly, the 1000 plus programme for Poland, secondly the fast and fair courts, thirdly the cultural voucher and the educational voucher, after fourth national security, fifthly it is a healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "Police must finally start making a decent start," which is why the Confederation wants to end their income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the tax-free problem will resolve itself".
"The Poles need to give a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, namely zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the "1000 plus programme for Poland" letter.
Alexander Zadencka, who started from second place of the list, referring to the software password “healthy life” said that “food is becoming increasingly quality” and to change this, “support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture”, should act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederate also advocates the cessation of "sygmatisation of hemps".
Zadencka declared support to the Confederation for “development of construction using natural raw materials”.
She also spoke on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccinations. ”
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
The next candidates to the Sym from the Koszali district stressed that the Confederation is behind "the implementation of a profound judicial reform", which should include the handling of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that the education subsidy would reach schools without self-government, which they said was without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The confederation is also behind the "strong Polish army, based on the Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
According to them, they also need easier access to weapons.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gas the coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy deposits, we also need to consider going back to the idea of the nuclear power plant," Peter Karpiński, fifth on the electoral list, said.
The chief of the Mexican cartel stands for one-third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drive after drugs.
Brian McKnight of the DEA in full light showed what was going on.
Almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago last year.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantessi, known simply as El Mencho.
"It is a top priority for the DEA and directly for the federal executives in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The El Mencho award goes to $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
Belonging to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genacion, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl contaminated heroin.
El Mencho's head will have a reward of $10 million.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he built the brutal cartel.
He's got a lot of guns, RPGs, weapons 50.
He basically owns his own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire by using measures such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in a public hanging this summer.
In recent years, cartel brutality has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, a pack of cocaine is a brand of smuggler.
For more than a third of them, they lead to El Mencho cartel.
"It is he who is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue thinks there's a "high chance" that drugs come from El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the president of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, according to the French prosecutor's office.
The defendant shall ensure that he has documents that compromise the presidential couple.
He asked the Head of State, among other things, 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in the police states that he received "explosive" documents from a person employed in the Elisha Palace.
During the hearings he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but the disclosure of them in its entirety could even endanger the safety of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return he demanded 300,000 euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from his previous marriage.
According to the D.A., the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would give them to the media – but it is not yet known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the audit at the 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric examination, but his doctors did not indicate any serious disturbances.
PS4 will be an old-school game – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debut soon available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, as part of a recent presentation by State of Play, announced that the Prime Minister of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new fragment of breath-absorbing games from the upcoming action game.
More details were revealed on the days following the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school climates in many ways.
It was decided on something we haven't seen very often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the Sequel has grown to one of the greatest games in history.
"The cabula is ambitious and has fallen into aspects in which the unit has not been," he said.
It had to be so extensive that it could present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the biggest game, so it just happened.
"There will be moments when you think you are going to the end, but you will realize that this is just the beginning and that a whole new chapter will begin," Druckmann says.
It's such an ambitious game that it doesn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easer eggi about adult content (information given by Gamespot).
We're not going to spoil the surprise, but the easer eggs that appear in the game are referring to the old-school Naughty Dog.
Learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on PS4 only on 21 February 2020.
People with PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the Sequel, reaching out to the Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony has recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to pre-premier order for a sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ellie's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult form.
Run, scrape and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskida and want to win.
Stomil's three-wheeled footballers are undefeated.
Petar Zażęzkowski's supporters won seven points at the time because they won the Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, they lost a goalless draw in Suvalki.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 o'clock, which is listed as one of the favorites for the promotion to the Extraklasa.
The closest rivals of Stomila take fourth place in the table and have an advantage over the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskide on the trips this season was played six times and scored two victories, draw and defeats by Natomasto Stomil very well on his property – at the stadium near Al. Piłsudski 69a the team of Piotr Zażęzkowski won three times and lost once.
A total of 17 points were collected in ten queues, and they are at the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the games nothing was expected.
"Every change needs time to be the result," explains Peter Skiba.
“And finally, something came up, we believed in each other, and we can work under normal conditions.
All we did was focus on playing ball.
There are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila footballers removed the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed games and a series of penalty shots.
In the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go, because Zázzzkowski was able to relax these key players before the Saturday fight with Podbeskid.
In the end, James Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited goal, played back in Chorzow.
“It’s always nice to score goals, and I’m still in such a moment that thanks to this we can continue to play in the cups (Mossakowski settled on 3:3 in the 119th minute - red.).
My dad always bit me and laughed that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he didn't expect to."
Now Mosakowski is counting on a return to the base, especially because the yellow cards cannot play Oloh Tarasenko.
"After that, I am hard on training so that I can play in the first composition," Mosakowski says.
“I did everything in the disease to present myself as best I could.
However, whether I play or sit on the reserve bench, I will be as strong a support team as I am.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
We will surely have a difficult meeting, in which victory will have to run out, draw out and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has recently also suffered injury, so if he does, we will only find out on Saturday, more so that Coach Zaszęzkowski traditionally tries to keep the case quiet until the end of the case.
The man raped and murdered his niece.
“You will never see the daylight.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and vile that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
5-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple pointed out where the body was hidden.
"How could anyone have done this to his own niece?" asked Day Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our life will never be the same again," added a devastated woman.
According to Fox News, Whipple's 22-year-old didn't show any emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted that he kidnapped, sexually exploited and murdered a girl.
A man’s lawyer said that his client was raised as a “inadequate family. ”
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is ready to be punished.
The man was sentenced to life without the possibility of applying for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would transfer nearly $100 million of additional funds to communities affected by drought.
The programme providing money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for granting allowances to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million on the drought community support initiative, so that eligible farmers can receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas of the Land-affected Communities Programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and assistance in coping with the impact of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to more than 7 billion dollars allocated by the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
Documentary film: In China the number of divorces has doubled in the last decade.
This situation was generally caused by third parties.
More and more men are maintaining nonmarital relations, which has led to the development of a special industry in this country – a professional lover's slayer who is tasked with saving the marriage of betrayed wives.
Let's do it loudly, Ma-te-ush!
Attempt to welcome the Prime Minister to the Silesian Piekars
A special trial was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekars Silesia.
"Dearest, louder, louder, this way we will not welcome your Prime Minister here!
Let's chant loudly, "Ma-te-uste!", encouraged the leader.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic efforts of the leader did not produce the expected results.
Election campaign in progress.
Politicians travel around the country convincing voters.
The intensive campaign is also led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as leader of the PiS list of Silesia is a frequent guest in the region.
Each meeting is scheduled precisely, including the appropriate workpiece.
That was the case, but rather – it was to be in the Silesian Bakery.
You should especially welcome a special guest.
Before meeting the Prime Minister, the host decided to conduct a general test.
Like a trained leader, he tried to encourage a crowd to chant the name of the chief of government.
"This will not be a welcome to me, but to you Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, more loud, my dears!", he encouraged the rosant.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not allowed to take full advantage of the lead and reluctantly responded to "Ma-te-ush", but the enthusiastic leader's recording makes a furore on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of Stephen and Katie Stay's murder in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the Stay house on 9 July 2014, demanding to disclose his wife’s whereabouts, Melanie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, according to Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on grounds of irreparability.
The jury will meet again on Monday to deliver judgment.
Quantum Internet closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are moving the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such a internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of time-sustaining opportunities not available at the traditional approach to networking.
The Centre for the Advanced Quantum Processing of Military Information of the Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army Battle Management was watching for researchers at the University of Insbruck, who were able to achieve a record transfer of the status between matter and light, 50 kilometres away with the use of fibre cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as cubits.
When two cubits are confused and one of them is measured, it will have an effect on the measurement made on the other, even if the other cubit is physically removed.
"These [50 km] are two rows of sizes as far as possible and this is a viable distance to the beginning of the construction of intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, whose discovery was published in Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of the physical networks of cubits, which are confused despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersal of confused state is necessary for the creation of quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward in order to achieve a mixed state on a large scale," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-authoring the military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the condition that is confused at the other end is also high enough to meet certain requirements of several of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team began an experiment with an atom of calcium trapped in an ionic trap.
Using laser circuits, researchers entered quantum state into ion while waking it to emit photon containing quantum information.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light have been confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fibre cable.
"The photon emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the lighthouse," Lanyon said.
Thus, his team initially sent a particle of light through a nonlinear crystal lit by a powerful laser beam.
The length of the photon wave has been converted to optimal for long-distance transmission – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon over a 50-kilometre fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still confused even after transformation of the wavelength and passing the distance.
‘The decision to select calcium means that this result is a direct route for the creation of a confused network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, as calcium can be associated with a high quality clock cubicle.’
The army is very keenly interested in confused large-scale clock networks due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronization", said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also manages the program.
