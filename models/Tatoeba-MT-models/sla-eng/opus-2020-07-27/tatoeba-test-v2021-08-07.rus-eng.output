A white pawn on f3, a black pawn on e6, a white pawn on g4, a black fair on h4 - mat! In chess circles, it is called a “asshole mat” in a joke.
White: ships on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White puts the rival in the position of the zugzwang, placing the unit on a6, and the blacks have only two options: take the unit on a6 or move the elephant on any other field with diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move the pedestrian from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In the second case, the white one takes the black sand on a7 with the same result.
